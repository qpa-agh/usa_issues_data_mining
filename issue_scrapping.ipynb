Funding comes from USDOT’s Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grant program. The City of York was awarded $3 million to alleviate dangerous blocked railroad crossings and the City of Fairfield was awarded $11.7 million to construct 3.8 miles of bicycle facilities.\\xa0\\n“Today marks a major step forward in our fight to eliminate blocked railroad crossing and provide safer and more accessible transportation systems in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District!”\\xa0celebrated Rep.

I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration, Secretary Buttigieg, and Federal Railroad Administrator Bose for making these transformational investments as we bring more resources and better opportunities to our communities here in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District.”\\xa0\\nIn York, the $3 million RAISE grant will be used to plan and design improvements between railroad-highway grade crossings and community impacts such as stopped and idling freight and passenger trains along Norfolk Southern Railways (NSR) AGS South District which also supports Amtrak's Crescent service. The plan will provide recommended improvements to the multimodal freight corridor, including those that seek to reduce conflicts with residential areas, as well as with passing and non-motorized traffic.\\n“It is a great day!”\\xa0said York Mayor Willie Lake. “Train blockages have been hindering York for the last 25 years and this is a step in the right direction to help alleviate the stress that the trains have been causing. We’re looking forward to working with Norfolk Southern, FRA, USDOT, Alabama Transportation Institute, and all the partners involved as we move forward.

It has been a long struggle.”\\nIn Fairfield, the $11.7 million RAISE Grant will go towards constructing approximately 3.8 miles of bicycle facilities along Dr. MLK Boulevard, Vinesville Road, and 52nd Street Ensley in Fairfield and Birmingham. The project will also construct three mobility hubs near the bicycle facilities.\\xa0\\n“This RAISE Grant is going to be transformational for the City of Fairfield.

Previously known as the Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) and Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Discretionary Grants, Congress has dedicated nearly $12.1 billion for fourteen rounds of National Infrastructure Investments to fund projects that have a significant local or regional impact.\\xa0\\nIn each competition, DOT receives hundreds of applications to build and repair critical pieces of our freight and passenger transportation networks. The RAISE program enables DOT to examine these projects on their merits to help ensure that taxpayers are getting the highest value for every dollar invested.\\xa0\\nFor more information on the Rebuilding America's Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity or RAISE Program Announcement, click\\xa0here.\\xa0\\n###\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Sewell highlighted how the Inflation Reduction Act is lowering prescription drug prices and capping insulin costs for Alabama seniors\\nLinden, AL\\xa0— Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) hosted a Seniors Resource Roundtable in Linden, Alabama. Representatives from AARP, the Social Security Administration, the Rural Health Medical Program, and the Alabama Tombigbee Regional Area on Aging were on hand to provide information and resources to seniors in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. Rep. Sewell highlighted how the Inflation Reduction Act is lowering health care and prescription drug costs for hundreds of thousands of Alabama seniors. She reiterated her strong commitment to protecting and expanding Social Security and Medicare.\\nPhotos are available for media and broadcast purposes\\xa0here.\\n“I convened this roundtable because I believe that every senior should be able to retire with dignity after a lifetime of work,”\\xa0said Rep. Sewell.\\xa0“Our seniors have spent their lives giving back to our communities, and we as Americans have a responsibility to ensure they receive the resources and care they need at a cost they can afford. I understand that. President Biden understands that. And it’s why we have made delivering for our seniors a top priority.”\\nWith Rep. Sewell’s support, Congress passed and President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022. Thanks to the IRA’s $35 per month insulin price cap, more than 29,000 Alabama seniors who rely on insulin—including 3,800 in Alabama’s 7th District—are saving an average of $400 annually compared to 2020. As a result of this law, the three largest manufacturers of insulin, who supply nearly all the insulin in the United States, announced that they would slash the cost of their insulins by up to 75%.\\nThe IRA also caps out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries at $2,000 annually beginning in 2025 and empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices to get a better deal for seniors.\\n“The bottom line is this,”\\xa0continued Sewell.\\xa0“No senior should have to choose between putting food on the table or paying for life-saving medication. That’s why these savings matter. It’s why I will continue to protect programs like Social Security and Medicare which are a lifeline for our seniors.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nMore information on the cost-saving benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act for Alabama’s 7th Congressional District can be found\\xa0here.',\n",

EPA’s Clean School Bus program was created by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and will help Alabama accelerate the transition to zero emission vehicles and to replace older, diesel fueled school buses, which have been linked to asthma and other conditions that harm the health of students and surrounding communities.\\xa0\\nRep. Sewell was the only member of Alabama’s Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\\xa0\\n“President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is once again delivering for Alabama!”\\xa0said Rep. Sewell.\\xa0“Not only will this funding reduce pollution and make our communities healthier, but it will also save our school districts money and free up resources to invest in the success of our students. I was so proud to help make this program possible and I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration for this investment into Alabama’s schools.\"\\xa0\\nSchool districts selected for rebates in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District include:\\n\\nSelma City\\xa0has been selected to receive $1,725,000 in rebate funding to purchase five clean school buses for the Lion Electric Co USA Inc.\\xa0\\nMontgomery County\\xa0has been selected to receive $690,000 in rebate funding to purchase two clean school buses for the Lion Electric Co USA Inc.\\xa0\\n\\nOther Alabama selectees include:\\n\\nThe Alabama Aerospace and Aviation\\xa0has been selected to receive $400,000 in rebate funding to purchase two clean school buses for the Student Transportation of America, Inc.\\xa0\\nClay County\\xa0has been selected to receive $1,035,000 in rebate funding to purchase three clean school buses for the Transportation South, Inc.\\xa0\\nFort Payne City\\xa0has been selected to receive $1,380,000 in rebate funding to purchase four clean school buses for the Transportation South, Inc.\\xa0\\nGulf Shores City\\xa0has been selected to receive $600,000 in rebate funding to purchase three clean school buses for the Navistar Inc.\\xa0\\nHuntsville City\\xa0has been selected to receive $ 8,625,000 in rebate funding to purchase 25 clean school buses for the First Student, Inc.\\xa0\\nJasper City\\xa0has been selected to receive $690,000 in rebate funding to purchase two clean school buses for the Transportation South, Inc.\\xa0\\nLanett City\\xa0has been selected to receive $1,725,000 in rebate funding to purchase five clean school buses for the Lion Electric Co USA Inc.\\xa0\\n\\nThe EPA Clean School Bus Program was created by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which provides an unprecedented $5 billion of funding to transform the nation’s fleet of school buses. The Clean School Bus Program funds electric buses, which produce zero tailpipe emissions, as well as propane and compressed natural gas (CNG) buses, which produce lower tailpipe emissions compared to their older diesel predecessors.\\nThe Clean School Bus Program will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save money for school districts, and produce cleaner air. Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other conditions that harm students’ health and cause them to miss school, particularly in communities of color and Tribal communities. Phasing out these diesel engines will ensure cleaner air for students, bus drivers, and school staff working near the bus loading areas, and the communities through which the buses drive each day.\\nThe reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from these bus replacements will also help to address the outsized role of the transportation sector in fueling the climate crisis. The program will save school districts money as they upgrade school bus fleets, replacing existing buses with brand new zero-emission and clean school buses, while freeing up needed resources for schools.\\xa0\\nView the full list of Clean School Bus Program awards\\xa0here.\\n\\xa0###',\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted in favor of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for five years. The bill will maintain American leadership in aviation safety and aerospace innovation, improve passenger protections and accessibility, strengthen and diversify the U.S. aviation workforce, and make groundbreaking investments in sustainability and resiliency.\\nThe FAA Reauthorization Act passed the House today by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 387 to 26. Having previously passed the Senate, it will now make its way to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.\\n“Americans depend on the Federal Aviation Administration for safe and reliable air travel,” said Rep. Sewell. “With this strong, bipartisan legislation, we are ensuring that the FAA can continue its essential mission for years to come.”\\n“I am particularly excited about the new protections for airline passengers included in this bill,” continued Sewell. “Thanks to provisions secured by Democrats, Americans will finally be able to sit next to young family members at no cost, and passengers will enjoy additional protections when their flights are delayed or canceled. We also authorized additional funding to recruit workers from underrepresented communities so that we can build a more diverse and inclusive aviation workforce.”\\nRep. Sewell and Congressional Democrats secured key wins in the FAA Reauthorization Act:\\nImproves and Expands Protections and Accessibility for Passengers:\\n\\nIt requires airlines to refund passengers with nonrefundable flights when their flight is canceled, significantly delayed, or changed if they choose not to fly on the delayed or changed flight.\\nIt directs DOT to require airlines to develop policies addressing reimbursement for passengers for hotel and meal costs when a flight is canceled or significantly delayed.\\nIt directs DOT to establish regulations requiring airlines to allow passengers to sit next to their young child to the greatest extent practical at no additional cost.\\n\\nStrengthens and Diversifies the U.S. Aviation Workforce:\\n\\nIt significantly increases funding for the FAA’s aviation workforce development grants to $60 million to strengthen our talent pipeline of pilots, aviation maintenance technical workers, and aviation manufacturing workers. It also transitions these grants to a new Cooperative Aviation Recruitment, Enrichment, and Employment Readiness (CAREER) grant program, with broader eligibility to promote workforce development opportunities.\\nIt also sets aside 20 percent of the total $60 million in funds for the Willa Brown Aviation Education Program to support outreach and educational opportunities in low-income communities.\\nIt encourages the FAA to continue its outreach and engagement with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to promote awareness of educational and career opportunities. It also directs the FAA to continue the operation of the MSI Internship Program.\\n\\nBill text is available here.',\n",

After leaving her job in 2011, Jackie bravely took on the risk of opening up her own small business, turning the site that once was a segregated diner into a beautiful coffee shop in the heart of downtown Selma. For 13 years, the Coffee Shoppe has provided a place for community to come together, learn about Selma's history, and eat some great food.\\nLike any business owner, Jackie has had her fair share of hardships. After the tornado of January 12, 2023, we saw her resilience, and thanks to an investment by the SBA, she was able to open her doors and continue the Coffee Shoppe's great legacy. And in fact, she opened up another business, Reflections.\\xa0\\nThis week, Jackie's extraordinary entrepreneurship earned her national recognition as the Small Business Administration's 2024 Phoenix Award Winner for Outstanding Disaster Recovery Efforts. We congratulate her on her outstanding achievements.\\xa0\\nToday, we also recognize SBA's 2024 Small Business Persons of the Year in Alabama, and that was Shanna Ullmann, Timothy Ullmann, and Robert Prescott of Transformation Partners, LLC in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\\nBeginning in the year 2000 as a statewide training provider, her firm has grown tremendously over the past two decades. Today, they serve numerous clients in the field of higher education, government, military, corporate America, offering consulting services and employee development programming.\\xa0\\nTransformation Partners was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. But once again, thanks to the assistance of the SBA, the firm remained operational and weathered the storm. Now their efforts have earned them national recognition as SBA's 2024 National Small Business Persons of the Year for Alabama.\\xa0\\nI ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the outstanding entrepreneurship in Alabama's 7th Congressional District. Congratulations to all of our winners. We wish you much success in the years ahead.\\n###\",\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) warned that House Republicans are risking serious consequences for Alabama families.\\n“Alabama families shouldn’t be forced to pay the price for House Republicans’ inability to govern,” said Rep Sewell. “A Republican government shutdown would force troops to work without pay, harm small businesses, risk air travel disruptions, and endanger access to food assistance for families. It is unconscionable that House Republicans would hurt working families, damage our economy, and endanger our national security.”\\n“I will continue to do everything in my power to keep the government open and protect the programs that Alabamians rely on,” continued Sewell. “It’s time for House Republicans to do their jobs, put American families first, and stop charging towards a government shutdown.”\\nAccording to new data released by House Budget Committee Minority, a Republican government shutdown would:\\n\\nForce troops to serve without pay: 38,017 active duty and reserve personnel serving our nation's armed forces in Alabama would be forced to go without the pay they earn during a shutdown.\\nHurt Alabama small businesses: The Small Business Administration would stop processing small business loans, halting a program that provides $284,694,700 in funding to small businesses in Alabama every year.\\nDisrupt air travel: 4,797 people flying through Alabama airports every day would face potential delays and safety concerns due to staffing impacts on TSA agents and air traffic controllers.\\nCut off food assistance for Alabama children and families: 111,999 people in Alabama would soon lose access to Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits. 772,813 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) beneficiaries in Alabama would lose access to benefits in a prolonged shutdown.\\nHurt federal workers: 46,826 federal workers in Alabama would be furloughed or forced to work without pay, in addition to the many employees of businesses with government contracts who could be laid off, furloughed, or see their hours cut.\\nJeopardize food and drug safety: Workers at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would be sidelined, risking interruptions and delays to the 224 food safety, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and other inspections conducted in Alabama last year.\\nHurt rural Alabamians’ ability to secure housing loans: The Department of Agriculture would be forced to stop processing housing loans, which provide $545,442,546 in funding to help 3,049 families in rural Alabama communities buy homes every year.\\nHurt Alabama farmers: The Department of Agriculture would be forced to stop processing farm loans which provide $93,451,000 in funding for farmers in Alabama every year.\\nClose National Parks: 1,294,952 people who visit national parks in Alabama every year would be turned away or unable to fully access parks, monuments, and museums.\\nPut vulnerable families at risk: State governments would be forced to pay for federal services like the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, potentially risking benefits for the 12,888 TANF beneficiaries in Alabama.\\n\\nConstituents with questions about the impacts of a Republican government shutdown can visit sewell.house.gov/governmentshutdown.\",\n",

       "  'date': 'June 7, 2023',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Bill Johnson (OH-06), along with Reps. Frank Mrvan and (IN-01) and Beth Van Duyne (TX-24), introduced bipartisan legislation to level the playing field for American workers. H.R. 3882, the Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0, would strengthen U.S. trade remedy laws to protect American workers and combat China’s unfair, anti-free market trade practices that distort the global market. Companion legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Todd Young (R-IN).\\n“As a member of the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, I am committed to ensuring that U.S. trade policy promotes fair competition and protects American workers against the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts to manipulate the global market,” said Rep. Sewell. “Along with Congressman Bill Johnson, I am proud to be introducing the Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 which would strengthen our trade remedy laws and push back against China’s egregious and unfair trade practices. We know that if American workers are given the opportunity to compete on a fair and level playing field, they will win on the world stage!”\\n“China’s communist regime continues taking deliberate steps that are hurting American workers and our economy by dumping steel, aluminum, and other products on the global markets with no repercussions. That must end,” said Rep. Johnson. “This bipartisan legislation will hold China accountable for these actions by ensuring that U.S. industries and the Department of Commerce have needed tools to seek relief from China’s illegal actions. A robust domestic steel and aluminum industry is critical to creating American jobs, strengthening our economy, and protecting our national security. We can’t wait any longer to act. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to ensure this bipartisan bill becomes law.”\\n“Thank you to Rep. Sewell for your steadfast leadership to update U.S. trade remedy laws and combat unfair trade practices,” said Rep. Mrvan. “Every effort must be taken to ensure that American workers can compete on a level playing field and thrive in our global economy.\\xa0 I look forward to continuing to work with all of my colleagues to advance this critical legislation to support the ability of all American workers to grow our economy and provide for our national security.”\\n“The Chinese Communist Party routinely ignores established trading rules and aggressively works to cheat the system in an attempt to shut American workers and manufacturers out of the global market,” said Rep. Van Duyne. “I appreciate Reps. Sewell and Johnson for their leadership on this important issue, and I look forward to continuing our bipartisan work to stand up to the CCP’s unfair trade practices.”\\nThe Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 combats many of China’s most egregious practices, such as:\\n\\nCountry Hopping to Escape U.S. Trade Remedies - After all the work of winning an anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) case, relief can be temporary as foreign producers move their factories to other countries to evade the AD/CVD orders. This legislation creates a new successive AD/CVD investigation to combat repeat offenders by making it easier for petitioners to bring new cases when production moves to another country. It also expedites timelines for successive investigations and factors for the International Trade Commission to consider about the relationship between recently completed trade cases and successive trade cases for the same imported product.\\n\\n\\nBelt and Road Initiative Subsidies - Currently, the Department of Commerce can only consider subsidies provided by the government under investigation. However, with the expansion of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, China is beginning to subsidize production in countries outside of China. This legislation would give Commerce the authority to apply CVD law to subsidies provided by a government to a company operating in a different country.\\n\\n\\nCircumventing U.S. Law - This legislation imposes statutory requirements for anti-circumvention inquiries to clarify the process and timeline. It also specifies the deadlines for preliminary and final determinations, which currently lack statutory deadlines.\\n\\nThe Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 enjoys strong support from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), the United Steelworkers (USW), and steel manufacturers in Alabama.\\n“By strengthening the effectiveness of the U.S. trade laws, this bill will help give the American public confidence that their government has every tool available to fight for a level playing field for the American steel industry and our workers,” said Kevin Dempsey, President and CEO of the American Iron and Steel Institute. “We appreciate the leadership of Representatives Johnson and Sewell in once again spearheading the fight to crack down on unfair trade and help preserve American jobs, competitiveness and cleaner American steel.”\\n“It has been eight years since Congress has updated our trade laws, and Representatives Terri Sewell and Bill Johnson have introduced the Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 to provide a much-needed refresh,” said United Steelworkers President Tom Conway. “The legislation will make U.S. trade laws more responsive to China’s foreign investments, which then dump product into the U.S. market. The bill also improves the process for follow-up on trade investigations, meaning U.S. workers and manufacturers can quickly move to stop unfair trade, wherever it comes from. USW endorses this bill and urges the House of Representatives to move quickly to pass it.”\\nThe Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 can be found here.',\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass H.R. 3746, the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, to prevent a devastating default while rejecting Republicans’ extreme demands to make deep cuts to programs that Alabama families rely on. The agreement, negotiated by President Biden, protects against cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans’ health care, historic infrastructure and climate investments, and the 40 million borrowers in President Biden’s student debt relief plan. It also prevents Republicans from manufacturing a similar crisis in the next two years by suspending the debt limit until January 1, 2025.

       "  'text': \"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined nearly 200 of her colleagues from across the House Democratic Caucus in a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy calling on Republicans to uphold their obligation to protect the full faith and credit of the United States by lifting the debt ceiling “without any extraneous policies attached.”\\n“It is a sad day when House Republicans shamefully hold our economy hostage and threaten to default on our debt unless Congress makes deep cuts to programs that Alabamians rely on,” said Rep. Sewell. “We in Congress should never play politics with the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Republicans must join us to raise the debt ceiling—just as they did three times under the previous administration—and avoid economic collapse.”\\n“I am a strong believer in balancing our budget,” continued Sewell. “Despite Republicans’ 2017 tax giveaway to the wealthy—which added $2 trillion to our deficit—I am proud of the historic deficit reduction that we have achieved under President Biden. If Republicans want to address our national debt, they should start by making the wealthy pay their fair share instead of targeting veteran benefits, food assistance, and other programs that hard working Alabama families rely on.”\\nIf agreed to, Speaker McCarthy’s debt ceiling demands would have devastating consequences for Alabama families. According to a report by the House Budget Committee Minority, House Republicans' debt ceiling proposal would:\\n\\nThreaten access to food assistance for 17,000 people aged 50-55 in Alabama.\\nEliminate preschool and child care for at least 5,600 children in Alabama.\\nIncrease housing costs for at least 8,800 people in Alabama.\\nMake college more expensive for at least 98,900 students in Alabama.\\nEliminate at least 3 air traffic control towers in Alabama.\\nCut at least 150 rail safety inspection days in Alabama.\\nRepeal investments in cleaner, cheaper energy — threatening at least 1,280 clean energy and manufacturing jobs announced in Alabama since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.\\n\\nIf Republicans do not get their way, and instead choose to cause an unprecedented credit default, they would unleash global economic catastrophe and put vital government services at risk. According to the report, a default would:\\n\\nKill about 6,000 jobs in Alabama’s 7th District alone. Nationwide, a default could kill more than 7 million jobs.\\nJeopardize Social Security payments for 101,000 families in Alabama’s 7th District.\\nPut health benefits at risk for 306,000 people in Alabama’s 7th District who rely on Medicare, Medicaid, or Veterans Affairs health coverage.\\nIncrease lifetime mortgage costs for the typical homeowner in Alabama by $43,000.\\nRaise the costs of a new car loan for the typical American by $800.\\nThreaten the retirement savings of 91,400 people near retirement in Alabama’s 7th District, eliminating $20,000 from the typical retirement portfolio.\\n\\nRep. Sewell and her Democratic colleagues made clear that while they welcome debate on spending and economic responsibility, negotiations over spending must be distinct from the threat of economic default, and any cuts to Social Security and Medicare are off the table.\\nThe full text of the letter can be found here.\",\n",

Claudia Tenney (NY-24), Danny Davis (IL-07), and Mike Kelly (PA-16) in introducing the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Extension Act. This legislation would spur investment and economic growth in Alabama’s rural and underserved communities by making the NMTC a permanent fixture of our tax code.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSet to expire on December 31, 2025, the New Markets Tax Credit was established in the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000, and is an essential source of financing for businesses and community facilities in low-income and rural areas across the country. The NMTC provides private investors with a 39 percent credit against federal income taxes for investments made in some of the most distressed communities in the nation. This bill makes the NMTC a permanent part of the Internal Revenue Code, indexes allocation levels to inflation in future years, and exempts NMTC investments from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).\\xa0\\n“In Alabama’s 7th Congressional District, we have seen firsthand the power of the New Markets Tax Credit to spur investment and incentivize economic growth in some of our most vulnerable and underserved communities,”\\xa0said Rep. Sewell.\\xa0“The New Markets Tax Credit remains a critical tool to promote job creation and provide opportunities to those who need them most. We must ensure that this tool is made a permanent part of our tax code, and that’s exactly what this legislation would do.”\\n“Now more than ever, it is essential that we work to create investments in our rural and low-income communities,”\\xa0said Rep. Tenney, lead Republican sponsor.\\xa0“Rural America is often forgotten by the Washington elites, which means that rural communities sometimes lack the necessary resources to invest, grow, and expand. Congress must make the New Markets Tax Credit permanent to allow our rural communities to continue accessing this important resource which helps to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. As a small business owner from rural America, I will always be a tenacious advocate for investments in our rural communities and businesses in Congress.”\\n“Over the years, the New Markets Tax Credit has well-proven its worth by revitalizing neighborhoods and cities that need the help the most,”\\xa0said Rep. Kelly.\\xa0“The New Markets Tax Credit Extension (NMTC) Act would allow more communities across the country to receive the benefits that I have seen firsthand in my district, including 518 new jobs from three projects in Northwestern Pennsylvania. Since the program’s inception, the NMTC has created over 24,000 permanent jobs and 27,000 construction across Pennsylvania. Along with revitalizing American’s Main Streets, the NMTC program is a job creator and I’m proud to support this legislation again in the 118th Congress!”\\n“The New Markets Tax Credit has been and remains absolutely vital for many of America’s urban neighborhoods and rural communities and will provide billions of dollars for high-impact, community revitalization projects,”\\xa0said Bob Rapoza, spokesperson for the NMTC Coalition.\\xa0“Over the years, the credit has been instrumental in financing plant and equipment for small manufacturing businesses and patient, flexible capital to other small businesses, hospitals, healthcare centers, homeless shelters and other transformative projects that improve communities, create jobs and economic opportunity. We appreciate the leadership of Representatives Tenney and Sewell in promoting more investment in distressed communities.”\\n“We commend Representatives Tenney and Sewell for leading the way to make the New Markets Tax Credit a permanent part of the tax code. It is one of the most concrete steps the 118th Congress could take to spur investment in economically distressed communities—from rural towns to urban neighborhoods, and everywhere in between,”\\xa0said Lori Chatman, Interim co-CEO, Enterprise Community Partners.\\xa0“This proposal is a bipartisan opportunity to add stability and efficiency to a program that has already delivered $120 billion in community assets and created more than 1 million jobs nationwide, including NMTCs Enterprise recently provided to finance the GLOW Healthy Living Campus in Batavia, New York.”\\nAdditional cosponsors include Rep. Miller (R-WV), Rep. Ferguson (R-GA), Rep. Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Rep. Schweikert (R-AZ), Rep. Smucker (R-PA), Rep. Wenstrup (R-OH), Rep. LaHood (R-IL), Rep. Yakym III (R-IN), Rep. Steube (R-FL), Rep.

Specifically, the bill would establish a new program that gives eligible workers access to portable, tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts. It would also offer federal matching contributions for low- and middle-income workers, with the match beginning to phase out at median income. Companion legislation was introduced by Sens.

I was proud to work with my House and Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance this commonsense bill which would level the playing field for working families and build a stronger economy for all Americans.”\\n“I appreciate the opportunity to advance meaningful bipartisan legislation to assist hardworking Americans save for their retirement,”\\xa0said Rep. Lloyd Smucker.\\xa0“Our legislation, the Retirement Savings for Americans Act, will create a pathway for millions of Americans to find financial security in their retirement. I look forward to continuing to advance this legislation in the next Congress and building upon the successes of SECURE 2.0 to help Americans become financially secure in their retirements.”\\n“Too many Americans are working their entire adult lives only to reach retirement and find they don’t have enough saved,”\\xa0said Sen. Hickenlooper.\\xa0“Helping people save is an easy, efficient way to cut income inequality while making sure all workers get the retirement they’ve earned.”\\n“Roughly 40 million Americans lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, which represents a significant roadblock to achieving financial security for their retirement,”\\xa0said Sen. Tillis.\\xa0“The Retirement Savings for Americans Act tackles this real problem by establishing a pathway for savings for Americans lacking retirement options.”\\nAround\\xa0one-third\\xa0of private-sector workers lack access to a workplace retirement plan, and roughly half of households\\xa0are at risk\\xa0of taking a cut to their standard of living in retirement.\\nThe bill contains the following provisions:\\n\\nEligibility and Auto Enrollment:\\xa0Full- and part-time workers who lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan would be eligible for an account, and they would be automatically enrolled at 3% of their income. They could choose to increase or decrease their withholding, or opt out entirely at any time. Independent workers (including gig workers) would also be eligible.\\nFederal Contribution: Low- and moderate-income workers would be eligible for a 1% automatic contribution (as long as they remain employed) and up to a 4% matching contribution via a refundable federal tax credit. This would begin to phase out at median income.\\nPortability: Accounts would remain attached to workers throughout their lifetimes, and workers would be able to stop and start contributions at will.\\nPrivate Assets: The accounts would be the property of the worker and the assets could be passed down to future generations to help them build wealth and financial security.\\nInvestment Options: Much like the current TSP, participants would be given a menu of simple, low-fee investment options to choose from, including lifecycle funds tied to a worker’s estimated retirement date, or index funds made of stocks and bonds.\\n\\n“Far too many Americans are unprepared for retirement. The Retirement Savings for Americans Act would tackle serious gaps in the U.S. retirement system that have hindered millions of workers from saving for a more certain and secure future,”\\xa0said Economic Innovation Group (EIG) President and CEO John Lettieri.\\xa0“By incorporating a range of proven features, this innovative legislation would greatly expand market access to high quality retirement plans and target savings incentives to workers who need them most. The result would be a healthier retirement system, a more secure workforce, and a stronger economy to the benefit of all Americans.

The bill would create a phase-in for the electric vehicle (EV) sourcing and manufacturing requirement provisions for automakers that was included in the final version of the IRA.\\n“Democrats’ historic Inflation Reduction Act includes critical tax credits that are bringing down the cost of electric vehicles and making them more accessible to working and middle class Alabamians, all while accelerating our transition to a clean energy economy,”\\xa0said Rep.

Cleaver.\\xa0“Our legislation takes important steps to make the historic electric vehicle tax credits passed in the Inflation Reduction Act\\xa0immediately accessible to consumers, particularly working- and middle-class Americans who would like to purchase an electric vehicle but need the federal credit to do so. As oil companies insist on continuing their exorbitant price-gouging of American families at the pump, these tax credits offer hardworking Americans immediate and significant financial assistance to help them purchase a vehicle that is better both for the environment and their wallets. This bill would be a major win for consumers, auto-workers, and businesses alike, and I will work with my colleagues to ensure it is signed into law by President Biden.”\\nThe Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act would delay the IRA’s phase-in period for automakers to follow specific sourcing requirements for their EVs in order for car buyers to qualify for the federal tax credit. These requirements include: requiring the EVs to be manufactured in North America; requiring EV batteries to be made domestically; and mandating that critical minerals used in battery production are only sourced domestically or from nations with whom America has a free trade agreement. Alabama automakers need additional time to meet these new on-shoring requirements and bring planned domestic EV facilities online, including the forthcoming Hyundai EV facility scheduled to open in 2025 in Bryan County, GA.\\nCompanion legislation\\xa0was introduced in the Senate by Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA).\\n“The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act will lower costs and provide consumers more options when purchasing an electric vehicle, while also supporting good-paying jobs across Georgia and our country,”\\xa0said Sen.

This funding is part of a $1.66 billion investment by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in 150 bus fleets and facilities across the nation to reduce pollution and meet President Biden’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. This year\\'s funding alone will nearly double the number of no-emission transit buses on America\\'s roadways. In Alabama, this funding will improve safety and reliability of transit services for residents of the Birmingham and Tuscaloosa regions while reducing pollution and advancing environmental justice.\\nThe Birmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority (BJCTA) will receive $13,654,636 to build a new maintenance facility and buy compressed natural gas, hydrogen fuel-cell and battery electric buses and charging equipment. This project and the new vehicles will improve the safety and reliability of transit service for residents in Jefferson County.\\nThe University of Alabama will receive $7,890,065 to replace diesel buses with new electric buses, buy charging equipment, and train maintenance workers to support the new electric bus fleet. The project will ensure continued service reliability, maintain a state of good repair, improve air quality, and advance environmental justice in the Tuscaloosa community.\\n“It’s hard to overstate the transformational impact that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is having here in Alabama,” said Rep. Sewell. “Once again, we’re seeing much-needed funding coming to our communities to upgrade our infrastructure, connect our communities, and clean up our environment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a true testament to what we can achieve when we put people over politics, and I was proud to be the only Member of Congress from Alabama to support it.”\\n“With this announcement, we’re bringing millions of dollars to Jefferson County for brand new vehicles and a new maintenance facility to keep them running smoothly,” continued Sewell. “That means safer and more reliable bus services for the residents of the Birmingham region. For our University of Alabama campus community, this announcement means better, greener buses and a cleaner, healthier environment.”\\nThese two projects were among 150 to be selected by the FTA out of a pool of more than 530 eligible proposals. The bus grant awards—made under FTA\\'s Buses and Bus Facilitiesand Low- and No-Emission Vehicle programs—are FTA\\'s first competitive grant selections under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The programs support the Biden-Harris Administration\\'s commitment to expand our nation\\'s transportation infrastructure, create and maintain good-paying jobs, and fight climate change.\\n“BJCTA has a lot to look forward to in the coming years,” said BJCTA Executive Director and CEO Charlotte Shaw. “We are excited to be a part of positive change and growth.

       "  'date': 'August 12, 2022',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, a historic legislative package that will tackle inflation, drive down health care and energy costs, cut the deficit, and make the largest investment to combat climate change in United States history. The bill is fully paid for by making the wealthiest corporations begin to pay their fair share. Included in the bill is Rep. Sewell’s climate justice legislation to reduce pollution and promote carbon capture technology. The Inflation Reduction Act passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 220-207 with every Democrat voting in favor of this significant legislation. Having passed the Senate last Sunday, the bill now heads to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.\\n“With passage of the historic Inflation Reduction Act, Congressional Democrats have once again delivered a major victory for the American people, the State of Alabama, and our planet!” said Rep. Sewell. “This bill caps drug costs for Alabama seniors and extends critical health care subsidies to drive down costs for families, all without raising taxes on anyone making under $400,000 per year. Instead, this bill is fully paid for by making the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share.”\\n“The Inflation Reduction Act also marks a major turning point in our fight to advance environmental justice, reduce pollution, and combat climate change,” continued Sewell. “I was proud to see that my bill, the Carbon Capture and Sequestration Expansion Act, was included in the climate title of this bill. While my colleagues on the other side spread falsehoods to protect billion-dollar corporations and special interests, I’m proud that my Democratic colleagues and I once again came together to deliver legislation that puts people over politics. I know this legislation will make a world of difference for so many Alabama families.”\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act takes bold action to lower health care costs and slash prescription drug costs for Alabamians. By extending the Affordable Care Act enhanced subsidies that are set to expire in January 2023 for three more years, the Inflation Reduction Act locks in lower health care premiums for 209,000 Alabamians who will save an average of $800 annually per person. It also empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prices for about 100 high cost, single-source drugs over the next decade. For Medicare beneficiaries, the bill caps out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 annually and caps the cost of insulin at $35 per month. Under this bill, if drug companies raise prices in Medicare faster than the rate of inflation, they are required to pay rebates back to Medicare for the difference, beginning in October 2022.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act is the largest investment to fight climate change, clean up pollution, and advance environmental justice in U.S. history. The bill’s $370 billion in climate resiliency investments would reduce U.S. carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030, and its $60 billion in environmental justice priorities will drive investments into disadvantaged communities. Notably, thanks to a provision cosponsored by Rep. Sewell, the bill reinstates the Superfund tax on crude oil and petroleum products to ensure that Superfund sites like the one in North Birmingham have the resources needed for environmental cleanup. The bill also includes Sewell’s climate justice legislation, the Carbon Capture and Sequestration Expansion Act, to reduce pollution and promote carbon capture technology.\\nContrary to Republican falsehoods, the Inflation Reduction Act contains no new taxes on families making $400,000 or less and no new taxes on small businesses. The bill is fully paid for by strengthening IRS enforcement against wealthy tax cheats, closing tax loopholes exploited by the wealthiest few, and implementing a 15% corporate minimum tax—which applies only to the 150 corporations earning over $1 billion in profits. Thanks to these provisions, the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to reduce the deficit by over $300 billion over the next decade.\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act enjoys bipartisan support from the American people, as well as a wide range of experts, climate activists, labor unions, business leaders and advocacy organizations. Over 7 in 10 voters overwhelmingly back the Inflation Reduction Act, including 95 percent of Democrats, nearly three-quarters of independents, and more than half of Republicans, according to a recent poll by Data for Progress.',\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted for historic, bipartisan legislation to strengthen Alabama families’ financial future, boost America’s research advantage and safeguard our economic and national security for generations to come. The CHIPS and Science Act will deliver a powerful investment in America’s global competitiveness—creating jobs, slashing kitchen table costs, ending dependence on foreign manufacturers, and turbocharging American innovation. The bill passed the House today by a vote of 243 to 187. Previously passed by the Senate, this legislation now heads to the President’s desk to be signed into law.\\n“The CHIPS and Science Act is a victory for Alabama and our nation!” said Rep. Sewell. “This major legislation is all about ensuring that America remains a world leader in science, technology, and innovation. By turbocharging our production of semiconductors, the CHIPS and Science Act will strengthen American manufacturing, lower costs, and bolster our independence from foreign suppliers, all while creating good-paying jobs here at home. I’m also thrilled that this bill will bring research investments to our local communities to help diversify our STEM workforce. I look forward to seeing President Biden sign it into law!”\\nA nationwide shortage of semiconductor chips has severely disrupted American manufacturing,\\xa0 slowing down production, spiking prices and increasing dependence on unfriendly foreign nations. Only 12 percent of semiconductor chips are currently manufactured domestically—a dramatic drop from 37 percent in the 1990s—while foreign competitors are investing heavily to dominate this critical national security industry. Other nations have also begun to outpace the United States’ research advantage, threatening American preeminence in technology and scientific innovation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act will reverse these dangerous trends, reasserting America’s economic independence and scientific dominance. Thanks to the strong leadership of House Democrats, this legislation:\\n\\nLowers costs for American consumers – by making more critical semiconductor components in America, helping end the shortage of chips that have driven up the price of everything from cars to consumer goods.\\nCreates 100,000 new good-paying jobs – creates strong Davis-Bacon jobs building hi-tech manufacturing facilities here in America.\\nEnds our dangerous dependence on foreign manufacturers – bringing critical semiconductor manufacturing back to America instead of overseas where it can be threatened by our adversaries.\\nTurbocharges American R&D – powering America’s preeminence in both basic research and next-generation technologies and ensuring that the technologies of the future are made here in America.\\nDiversifies and expands the innovation workforce – broadening the pool of brainpower and talent so that we are embracing the full potential from all our communities, helping to diversify our STEM workforce and advancing regional technology hubs to ensure communities across the country can help in American research and development.\\n\\nThis legislation also includes strong guardrails to ensure that federal semiconductor investments go straight into Alabama’s economy—not corporate pockets or unfriendly nations. The CHIPS and Science Act will:\\n\\nProhibit companies from using chips funding for stock buybacks or dividend payments.\\nBar funding recipients from expanding semiconductor manufacturing in countries of concern.\\nRequire strong oversight and tight Congressional control over the use of federal funds.',\n",

This legislation will support our neighbors and families, create good-paying jobs, and protect Alabamians’ health and well-being. Within this package, Rep. Sewell secured millions in funding for local community projects in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. It will now make its way to the U.S. Senate.\\n“This government funding package invests in Alabama families and advances many of the priorities that Alabamians value most, creating good-paying jobs, improving our infrastructure, and bolstering our economy,” said Rep. Sewell. “I’m so proud to have helped secure millions of dollars in funding for local projects in our district! The funding for these projects responds directly to the needs of our communities, which is why I fought so hard for its inclusion. It is my hope that the Senate will swiftly approve this funding and send it to President Biden’s desk.”\\nRep. Sewell secured funding for the following local community projects in the FY2023 government funding which passed the House today:\\n\\n$4,000,000 for Blight Removal in Montgomery - The funding would be used to redevelop blighted properties within the City of Montgomery with the intention to revitalize neighborhoods that have historically seen a lack of investment opportunities.\\n$4,000,000 for the Selma Riverfront Multi-Plex - The funding would be used to acquire, redevelop and construct a center for essential public safety services accessible for all members of the community.\\n$4,000,000 for the Birmingham Valley Creek Rails to Trails Project - The funding would be used to redevelop and construct a 4.57-mile recreation and transportation project for low-income city residents.\\n$500,000 for the Town of Orrville Public Library - The funding would be used for the construction of a new municipal public library providing access to educational resources for a historically underserved community.\\n$750,000 for the Bethel Baptist Church Family and Child Center - The funding would be used to construct a multi-purpose community center providing child care and educational support for youth & families in a neighborhood that has experienced economic hardship and overall lack of investment for decades.\\n$1,500,000 for the Historic Brown Chapel AME Church Restoration - The funding would be used to stabilize the structure of the building to allow for further restoration of the sanctuary, bell towers, and brickwork.

       "  'text': 'Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined Mayor Randall Woodfin to welcome U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg to Birmingham, Alabama. During his visit, Secretary Buttigieg announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is now accepting applications for the first-of-its-kind Reconnecting Communities program. Created by President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the $1 billion pilot program will help reconnect communities that were previously cut off from economic opportunities by transportation infrastructure. As the only member of Alabama’s congressional delegation to vote in favor of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Sewell fought to ensure that equity was a central focus of the legislation.\\nThursday morning, Rep. Sewell hosted a roundtable discussion with Secretary Buttigieg, Mayor Woodfin, and community stakeholders to give local officials the opportunity to speak directly with federal leaders. They then embarked on a bus tour to give the Secretary a firsthand look at the Birmingham Xpress Bus Rapid Transit service, a program that will soon connect residents from 25 communities to jobs, schools, and healthcare.\\xa0\\n“I think it’s critically important that we bring together our local and federal officials for a chance to speak directly about the needs of those we serve,” said Rep. Sewell.“Conversations like these really help strengthen our partnership on behalf of the people of the 7th Congressional District and move our communities forward.”\\nRep. Sewell joined Secretary Buttigieg and Mayor Woodfin for a press conference announcing the new Reconnecting Communities Program, a $1 billion, first-of-its-kind initiative from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law dedicated to reconnecting communities that were previously cut off from economic opportunities by highways and other transportation infrastructure. Reconnecting a community could mean adapting existing infrastructure—such as building a pedestrian walkway over or under an existing highway—to better connect neighborhoods to opportunities or better means of access such as crosswalks and redesigned intersections.\\n“The Reconnecting Communities program will help right the wrongs of our past by connecting\\xa0neighborhoods that were previously divided by highways and other infrastructure,” continued Sewell. “This is about making sure that people can live where they want to live more affordably while accessing the jobs, schools, and services our city has to offer. I applaud Secretary Buttigieg and the entire Biden-Harris Administration for making these investments which harness the power of transportation infrastructure to connect our communities and build a more equitable future.”\\n\"Transportation can connect us to jobs, services, and loved ones, but we‘ve also seen countless cases around the country where a piece of infrastructure cuts off a neighborhood or a community because of how it was built,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. \"Using funds from President Biden\\'s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are proud to announce the launch of Reconnecting Communities: the first-ever dedicated federal initiative to unify neighborhoods living with the impacts of past infrastructure choices that divided them.\"\\nSecretary Buttigieg also visited the 16th Street Baptist Church to connect with other community leaders and learn about the church’s history and role in catalyzing the Civil Rights Movement.\\nFor more information about the Reconnecting Communities program, click here.

Sewell began by visiting Thomasville’s Westervelt Lumber Mill where she toured the facility and spoke with employees during a town hall event. She then toured the Thomasville Regional Medical Center and met with the facility's leadership to help address their urgent funding needs.\\nAfter arriving at Westervelt Lumber’s Thomasville Mill, Rep. Sewell spoke with the facility's employees during a town hall event and provided an update on her bipartisan legislation, the Disaster Reforestation Act, which would help the lumber industry recover following a natural disaster. Sewell then toured the facility for a firsthand look at Westervelt’s work which serves customers across the United States.\\n“I know just how critical the timber industry is to Alabama’s 7th Congressional District and to the State of Alabama,” said Rep. Sewell. “I want to thank Westervelt Lumber for bringing jobs, opportunities, and investments right here to our Clarke County community.”\\xa0\\n“I also know companies like Westervelt face an immense financial burden when natural disasters damage our forests,” continued Sewell. “We must ensure that our tax code allows businesses to recover when disaster strikes, which is why I’m proud to be leading the bipartisan Disaster Reforestation Act in the House of Representatives. This bill would provide needed relief to this critical industry, allowing companies to claim losses of uncut timber from fire, storms, insects, invasive species, drought, or theft.”\\n“The Westervelt Company was pleased to welcome Congresswoman Sewell to our Thomasville Lumber facility today,” said Westervelt President and CEO Brian Luoma. “We appreciate her support on issues important to our industry, including the benefits of managed forests and the economic impact to our local communities.”\\nFollowing her stop at Westervelt Lumber, Sewell visited the Thomasville Regional Medical Center where she met with hospital officials about how she can best support efforts to keep the hospital open. For months, Rep. Sewell has been strongly advocating for critically-needed federal support to address the hospital’s urgent financial situation. During today’s visit, she reiterated her commitment to supporting the hospital which serves as a critical resource for those living in the Black Belt.\\n“The residents of Thomasville, Clarke County, and the Black Belt depend on the Thomasville Regional Medical Center for lifesaving care,” said Rep. Sewell. “I, along with Mayor Day, have been working tirelessly to find solutions that would address the hospital’s urgent financial needs. I want my constituents to know that I am committed to doing everything in my power to assist the Thomasville Regional Medical Center so that it can continue to serve this community.”\\n“We are fortunate to have Congresswoman Sewell on our team,” said Thomasville Mayor Sheldon Day. “She has been an integral part of our efforts to improve our community and to raise the level of health care throughout the Black Belt.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted for new bipartisan legislation to lower the cost of food and fuel, another step forward in House Democrats’ fight against inflation. The Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act will help bring down prices for Alabamians in the grocery store and at the gas pump by giving American farmers and ranchers the support they need to thrive.\\n“Today, I proudly voted for more strong action to fight inflation and bring down costs for Alabamians,” said Rep. Sewell. “Putin’s war in Ukraine is driving up the cost of fuel and food all over the world. But by lowering costs for America’s farmers, we can lower costs for families in the grocery store. I want my constituents to know that President Biden and Congressional Democrats remain laser-focused on bringing down costs for families in Alabama and across the country.”\\nThe Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act takes three steps to lower costs for America’s families:\\xa0\\n\\nLower Fertilizer Costs in the Field to Lower Food Prices in the Grocery Store.\\xa0Russia and Ukraine are major global producers of key components of fertilizer, and Putin’s war has dramatically driven up the costs of fertilizer for American farmers – in turn, driving up prices in the grocery store too.\\xa0The Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act reduces our dependence on foreign fertilizer production and includes two bipartisan bills to help American farmers lower their costs with $500 million in USDA funds as well as loan guarantees to pay for solutions, including precision agriculture, to use fertilizers more efficiently.\\xa0Lower costs for farmers mean lower costs for families.\\nLower Meat and Poultry Costs by Increasing Meatpacking Competition and Capacity.\\xa0Unfair, anti-competitive practices by the major meatpacking conglomerates who dominate the market are driving up the price of meat and poultry in the supermarket even as many of the men and women who raise the beef, pork and chicken are forced to accept prices that make it almost impossible to make ends meet. The Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act strengthens competition in the meat and poultry sector and alleviates the supply chain bottlenecks that let meatpacking conglomerates set bad prices for producers and consumers alike.\\xa0The bill includes the bipartisan Butcher Block Act to expand and create new meat processing capacity and options to market cattle, as well as the bipartisan Meat & Poultry Special Investigator Act, establishing a USDA Special Investigator for Competition Matters with new powers to swiftly crack down on anti-competitive practices by meatpacking conglomerates in violation of the long-standing Packers and Stockyards Act.\\xa0Better enforcement will lead to greater competition in meat processing, fairer access to markets for producers and more price stability for consumers.\\nLower Prices at the Pump by Making Cheaper, Cleaner Unleaded 88 More Available.\\xa0Homegrown American ethanol grown by American farmers is one of our most powerful tools to fight Putin’s Price Hike on American families, and nextgen biofuels infrastructure can make it even cleaner and more efficient to produce. Unleaded 88 is a cleaner, typically cheaper fuel option that costs on average approximately 40 cents less per gallon, emits less carbon pollution and burns cleaner than regular gas.\\xa0The Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act expands access to lower-cost Unleaded 88 and taps the power of American farmers to break the grip of foreign autocrats weaponizing the price of oil and gas.\\xa0The bill includes the bipartisan Year-Round Fuel Choice Act, which builds on the Biden Administration’s action allowing for the voluntary year-round sale of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol, known as E-15 or Unleaded 88.\\xa0The bill also includes the bipartisan Renewable Fuel Infrastructure Investment and Market Expansion Act, which invests $200 million to help deploy additional storage and dispensing equipment to ensure that higher ethanol blends, biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel and other biofuels are more readily available across the country.\\n\\nThe Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act builds on House Democrats’ ongoing work to strengthen supply chains and bring down costs for working families. Earlier this week, the Congress passed the Ocean Shipping Reform Act to ease the burden of rising costs for consumers, retailers and farmers by cracking down on exorbitant shipping fees. The House previously passed the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act to combat Big Oil’s excessive gas price hikes. Meanwhile, the House and Senate are continuing to advance a bold competitiveness package that will lower costs by reinvigorating American manufacturing while strengthening our supply chains.',\n",

Sewell (AL-07) voted to reauthorize the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), legislation that will help unleash the full potential of Alabama’s workforce by ensuring Alabamians have the skills they need to succeed. Amid the strongest job growth in modern times, these investments will connect Alabamians to a record number of job openings—bringing workers off the sidelines, increasing production, and lowering the cost of key goods.\\n“Today, I proudly voted to invest in Alabama’s workforce, which is the cornerstone of economic growth and prosperity in our state,” said Rep. Sewell. “By fully funding our federal workforce development system, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will deliver high-quality job training and empower Alabamians to take advantage of record job growth we’re experiencing under President Biden. By getting people in jobs, this legislation will help bolster Alabama’s manufacturing base and lower costs for hardworking Alabama families.”\\xa0\\nWIOA makes up the heart of the United States’ workforce development system, but its Congressional authorization has not been renewed since lapsing in 2020. Additionally, while the U.S. labor force has grown by roughly half over the past four decades, federal workforce development spending has fallen by two thirds. This funding gap means that essential job training services are frequently unavailable to Alabamians who need them most.\\nToday’s reauthorization fully funds WIOA for six years, allowing the workforce development system to train one million American workers per year by 2028. Additionally, it further expands pathways to opportunity by strengthening the Job Corps program, supporting summer and year-round jobs programs for young people and establishing a new employment program for formerly incarcerated Americans. By helping fill a record number of job openings, these workforce development investments will power the economy and lower costs for working families.\\xa0\\nIn order to further address good shortages and rising prices, the House passed the America COMPETES Act earlier this year. This legislation will deliver transformative investments to strengthen the United States’ broken supply chains, reinvigorate American manufacturing and boost production across key industries. The Congress is now working to deliver a final bipartisan, bicameral supply chain package to the President’s desk.',\n",

The awards are part of a $90 million investment by the Biden-Harris Administration to grow America’s clean energy workforce with education and training for young adults.\\nThe following organizations were named as recipients of DOL’s YouthBuild grant program:\\n\\nBessemer Housing Authority - $1,500,000\\nHousing Authority of Birmingham District (HABD) - $1,500,000\\nCornerstone Revitalization Foundation - $1,259,237\\n\\n“I’m thrilled that the greater Birmingham region will be receiving over $4.2 million from the Department of Labor!” said Rep. Sewell. “This announcement is truly a win-win for our community. By connecting at-risk youth with job training and education, this funding will provide our most vulnerable young adults with the resources they need to succeed, all while growing our green energy workforce. Once again, I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration for making transformational investments in our community!”\\xa0\\n“We are delighted to be awarded the Department of Labor YouthBuild Grant to help provide the youth of Bessemer, Alabama with additional resources, furthering their education and preparing them to become productive citizens in our community,” said Courtney Coleman, Executive Director of the Bessemer Housing Authority. “We believe these funds along with our community partners will work together to ‘Build Better Lives’ and ‘Deliver Hope’, which is the mission here at the Bessemer Housing Authority.”\\n“This is a monumental win for our agency,” said HABD Board Chairman Dr. Anthony Hood. “This award allows us to equip our most promising youth with the tools needed to thrive in an ever-competitive workforce. The demand for skilled trades and apprenticeships has never been stronger, and this grant allows us to place our young people on a direct path to the careers of the future.\"\\n“Often, when a child drops out of school, society takes it as a sign that they have given up hope that life can get any better for them. This grant allows us to seek out those youth and give that hope back to them,” said HABD Interim President and CEO Dontrelle Young Foster. “With this award, HABD can prepare residents for quality jobs and promote the attainment of skills necessary for success in this knowledge-based economy. This is a win not only for the clients we serve at HABD but also for the entire City of Birmingham. \"\\nFollowing its Nov. 23, 2021 announcement of available funding, DOL awarded 68 grants—ranging from $700,000 to $1.5 million—to organizations in 28 states and Puerto Rico to deliver job training and employment services. Participants will engage in classroom learning that will prepare them for work-based learning opportunities building and rehabilitating affordable housing for low-income or homeless families in their communities.\\nParticipants will split their time between workplace training and the classroom, where they will earn a high school diploma or equivalent degree to prepare for postsecondary opportunities.\\nAdministered by the department\\'s Employment and Training Administration, the latest YouthBuild grants complement the Biden-Harris administration\\'s workforce priorities to advance equitable career pathway opportunities, quality jobs and climate sustainability by supporting programs that provide construction skills focused on green building techniques, including understanding sustainable building materials, solar panel installation, weatherization processes and the use of Energy Star appliances. These announcements will also further President Biden\\'s Justice40 Initiative that commits to delivering at least 40 percent of the benefits from federal climate and clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities.\\nFor the first time, the YouthBuild funding opportunity announcement included criteria that awarded bonus points for applicants that demonstrated their ability to provide training in green construction techniques, training the next generation of workers for resilience and clean energy careers of the future.\\nYouthBuild programs also train young people for employment in healthcare, information technology, manufacturing and logistics, culinary arts, and hospitality.\\nLearn more about the YouthBuild program.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to secure urgently needed relief for small businesses across Alabama. H.R. 3807, the Relief for Restaurants & Other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act, will deliver $55 billion to replenish relief funding for restaurants and establish a new program supporting other small businesses impacted by the pandemic. The bill passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 223-203.\\n“Small businesses are the lifeblood of Alabama’s economy,” said Rep. Sewell. “Today, House Democrats are once again taking action to support small businesses that were hit hardest by the pandemic. The Restaurant Revitalization Fund, which we created in the historic American Rescue Plan, has served as a lifeline for Alabama’s restaurants and small businesses, providing over $150 million in relief. Today’s legislation builds on our progress with additional funding for these establishments to ensure they can continue to reopen, recover, and rehire. As we build a better Alabama, I will continue to make supporting our small businesses a top priority!”\\nThe Relief for Restaurants & Other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act delivers critical assistance to small businesses in three ways:\\n\\nReplenishes the Restaurant Revitalization Fund to rescue struggling establishments - Established through Democrats’ American Rescue Plan, which Sewell helped pass, the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) distributed $28.6 billion to restaurants across the country – including $154,096,761 for 866 small businesses in Alabama. Due to its popularity, the program quickly exhausted its funding before more than 170,000 eligible businesses could access relief. The Relief for Restaurants & Other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act will provide $42 billion to replenish the RRF so that these restaurants can apply for this assistance.\\xa0\\nHelps ensure that the hardest hit small businesses don’t get left out - H.R. 3807 provides $13 billion to establish the new Hard Hit Industries Award Program, an SBA initiative to assist small businesses from across industries that were hardest hit by the pandemic and lost revenue but were not eligible for other grants or awards. Businesses eligible for these grants would have 200 or fewer employees and have experienced 40 percent or more in lost revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nProvides much-needed flexibility to theaters, performing arts centers, and other venues to expend relief funds - The bill amends the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant Program by extending the timeframe that current award recipients are required to incur expenses and expend grant funds\\n\\nThis legislation is paid for responsibly and is funded in part by transferring funds that are reclaimed, seized, or returned to the Federal Government primarily from bad actors attempting to defraud prior small business pandemic relief funds including the Paycheck Protection Program, Shuttered Venue Operators Grant Program, COVID EIDL loans and others.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) lauded the passage of the Securing a Strong Retirement Act—also known as the SECURE Act 2.0—in the House of Representatives. This robust retirement savings package, which passed yesterday by a bipartisan vote of 414-5, includes H.R. 2944, a bill that Sewell introduced to make it easier for part-time workers to start contributing to their employer’s 401k plan. Sewell’s bill incentivizes saving by reducing the number of years of service required for part-time workers to make retirement contributions. As women are more likely to work part-time than men, this provision is particularly impactful for women in the workforce.\\n“We know that Alabama’s working families are facing a retirement crisis,” said Rep. Sewell. “Too often, incentives to save are designed to benefit the wealthy and the upper-middle class, leaving many families without adequate savings even after a lifetime of work. My bill addresses this fundamental inequity in our tax code by rebalancing incentives to save and making it easier for part-time workers to save sooner in their careers. I’m thrilled that this bill passed the House and will continue to advance policies that ensure all working people can retire with dignity and financial security!”\\nH.R. 2944, the Reducing the Maximum Service Requirement for Long-term Part-time Workers to Make Elective Deferrals to 401(k) Plans Act, amends the long-term part-time years of service 401(k) participation requirement included in the 2019 SECURE Act. The SECURE Act provides that except in the case of collectively bargained plans, employers maintaining a 401(k) plan must have a dual eligibility requirement under which an employee must complete either a one year of service requirement (with the 1,000-hour rule) or three consecutive years of service where the employee completes at least 500 hours of service. H.R. 2944 reduces the three-year rule to two years, allowing for part-time employees to begin saving for retirement sooner.\\nH.R. 2944 can be found here.',\n",

These programs include Community Facilities Direct Loans and Grants, Community Facilities Loan Guarantees, Community Facilities Technical Assistance Training Grants, Community Facilities Disaster Grants, and Economic Impact Initiative Grants. The projects will finance emergency response vehicles and equipment; build or improve hospitals and clinics and help fund other essential community facilities.

She took the opportunity to thank frontline workers for fighting to keep residents of the 7th District safe and healthy during the pandemic.\\nShe then visited Carl Turk County Road 12 in Livingston to highlight the over $6 billion in federal funding for Alabama included in the infrastructure law that will help fix Alabama’s roads and reduce the backlog of major repairs for highways and bridges in Alabama.\\xa0\\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will:\\n\\nCreate Millions of Good-Paying Jobs - Together with the Build Back Better Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will create an average of 2 million jobs per year over the course of the next decade.\\xa0\\nRepair and Rebuild Alabama’s Roads and Bridges - The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Alabama would expect to receive:\\n\\n$5.2 billion for federal-aid highway apportioned programs\\n$225 million for bridge replacement and repairs under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act over five years.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nConnect Every Alabamian to High-speed Internet - Broadband internet is necessary for Alabamians to do their jobs, participate equally in school learning, health care, and to stay connected. Yet 18% of Alabama households do not have an internet subscription, and 11.5% of Alabama residents live in areas where, under the FCC’s benchmark, there is no broadband infrastructure. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Alabama will receive a minimum allocation of $100 million to help provide broadband coverage across the state, including providing access to the at least 565,000 Alabamians who currently lack it. It also makes 1,518,000 Alabamians (31%) eligible for the Affordability Connectivity Benefit, which will help low-income families afford internet access.\\nMake Transformational Investments in Alabama’s Water Infrastructure - Currently, up to 10 million American households and 400,000 schools and child care centers lack safe drinking water. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, based on the traditional state revolving fund formula, Alabama will expect to receive $782 million over five years to improve water infrastructure across the state and ensure that clean, safe drinking water is a right in all communities. The bill also includes $23 billion nationally for the bipartisan Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act.\\nImprove Healthy, Sustainable Transportation Options - Alabamians who take public transportation spend an extra 66.2% of their time commuting and non-White households are 4.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation. 25% of transit vehicles in the state are past useful life. Based on formula funding alone, Alabama would expect to receive more than $400 million over five years under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to improve public transportation options across the state.\\n\\nAlabama can also compete for the $12.5 billion Bridge Investment Program for economically significant bridges and nearly $16 billion of national funding in the bill dedicated for major projects that will deliver substantial economic benefits to communities.\\nPhotos and videos from today’s events in Demopolis and Livingston can be found here.',\n",

I applaud everyone for their continued work in promoting growth and economic opportunity through high-quality jobs to residents in Selma and across the Black Belt.”\\nBackground:\\nThe Selma plant closed in 2018 due to low prices for silicon metal caused by foreign dumping.\\nAs a result of an increased demand and rise of prices, the plant in Selma reopened in November 2021. Globe Metallurgical, Inc. spent millions of dollars refurbishing the plant, aided by the Dallas County Commission and the State of Alabama in preparation for the plant’s reopening in January 2022.Additionally, the company hopes to secure federal New Market Tax Credits, which will enable further investment and an expansion of capabilities in the Selma operation.\\nAt full production, the facility will employ around 100 people in the region and will do business with 150 local suppliers. The two-furnace operation can produce up to 22,000 tons of silicon metal a year. The plant plans to restart the first furnace in January 2022, soon followed by a complete ramp-up to full operational capacity.\\nGlobe Metallurgical, Inc is a subsidiary of Ferroglobe PLC.\\xa0 Ferroglobe is one of the world’s leading suppliers of silicon metal, silicon- and manganese- based specialty alloys, and ferroalloys, serving a customer base across the globe in dynamic and fast-growing end markets, such as solar, semiconductors, automotive, consumer products, construction, and energy.

       "  'date': 'December 7, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (D-AL) joined Reps. Carol Miller (R-WV), Stephanie Murphy (D-FL), and Kevin Hern (R-OK) to introduce the Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) Reinstatement Act. The ERTC was designed to help small businesses rehire and retain employees they had to let go due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was overwhelmingly supported in the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed in March 2020.\\n“From our biggest cities to our rural towns, our nation’s small businesses help our communities thrive,” said Rep. Sewell. “As we build back better from the COVID-19 pandemic and grow our economy, we must make supporting our small business owners a top priority. By reinstating the Employee Retention Tax Credit, this bipartisan bill will provide much needed relief to Alabama’s small businesses, helping them rehire workers lost due to the pandemic. I was proud to join my colleagues in introducing this commonsense legislation and urge swift passage!”\\n“I’m pleased to lead my Ways and Means colleagues in introducing the Employee Retention Tax Credit Reinstatement Act,” said Rep. Carol Miller, lead Republican sponsor. “By reinstating the ERTC, struggling small businesses can access one of the last remaining pandemic recovery programs to receive the help they need to replenish their workforce and get back on track. As we continue to emerge from this public health emergency, we must remember that small businesses in West Virginia and across the country still need our support. I urge Congressional leaders and President Biden to pass our bill into law as soon as possible to give these businesses and employees the certainty they need.”\\n“Over the last year and a half I was proud to lead the bipartisan effort to establish the employee retention tax credit, which provides financial support to businesses who retain or rehire workers, rather than lay them off,” said Rep. Stephanie Murphy, lead Democratic co-sponsor. “This provision has helped thousands of businesses and their workers recover and rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic, and so my fellow Ways and Means colleagues and I are introducing this bipartisan legislation to ensure this program can continue and give small businesses and hardworking Americans the support they need.”\\n“Eliminating the Employee Retention Tax Credit was the wrong decision and hurts our small businesses who are still recovering from the economic fallout of the pandemic. We must provide certainty and predictability to American small business owners. I am proud to join my colleagues in support of this legislation and I hope to earn strong bipartisan support in the House,” said Rep. Kevin Hern, lead Republican co-sponsor.\\nBackground:\\nOriginally, to be eligible for the ERTC, business owners had to demonstrate at least a 20% decline in gross receipts in either a given quarter compared to the same quarter in 2019 or the immediately preceding quarter. Alternatively, the business owner may have been eligible if the business is subject to a full or partial suspension of business operations due to a government order.\\nSpecifically, for this year’s third and fourth quarters, business owners can qualify for the ERTC as a “recovery startup business” or qualify as a “severely financially distressed employer.” To claim the ERTC as a “severely financially distressed employer,” the business must have suffered at least a 90% decline in gross receipts in a specific quarter compared to the same quarter in 2019.\\nMany small businesses have continued to take the tax credit into the fourth quarter, and now face a retroactive tax increase and a complex, frustrating process in reconciling the credit that they will now have to forfeit.',\n",

The Level the Playing Field Act 2.0 would strengthen U.S. trade remedy laws to protect American workers and combat China’s unfair, anti-free market trade practices that distort the global market.\\n“Protecting American workers and countering China’s unfair trade practices must be central pillars of U.S. trade policy,” said Rep. Sewell. “My Level the Playing Field Act 2.0 will support America’s workers by strengthening our trade remedy laws and promoting fair competition by pushing back against China’s egregious efforts to manipulate the global market in their favor. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Congressman Bill Johnson and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give it their full support!”\\n“For far too long, China and its communist regime have taken deliberate steps to hurt American workers and the American economy by dumping steel, aluminum, and other products on the global markets with no repercussions. That must end,” said Rep. Bill Johnson, lead Republican co-sponsor. “This bipartisan legislation will hold China accountable for these actions by ensuring that U.S. industries and the Department of Commerce have the tools needed to seek relief from China’s actions. A robust domestic steel and aluminum industry is critical to repairing America’s aging infrastructure and creating American jobs, the American economy, and American national security. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to ensure this bipartisan bill becomes law.”\\nThe bill is\\xa0 designed to combat many of China’s most egregious practices, such as:\\n\\nCountry Hopping to Escape U.S. Trade Remedies - After all the work of winning an anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) case, relief can be temporary as foreign producers move their factories to other countries to evade the AD/CVD orders.\\xa0Title I of this legislation creates a new successive AD/CVD investigation to combat repeat offenders by making it easier for petitioners to bring new cases when production moves to another country. Title II outlines expedited timelines for successive investigations and factors for the International Trade Commission to consider about the relationship between recently completed trade cases and successive trade cases for the same imported product.\\nBelt and Road Initiative Subsidies - Currently, the Department of Commerce can only consider subsidies provided by the government under investigation. However, with the expansion of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, China is beginning to subsidize production in countries outside of China. Section 201 of this legislation would give Commerce the authority to apply CVD law to subsidies provided by a government to a company operating in a different country.\\nCircumventing U.S. Law - Section 301 of this legislation imposes statutory requirements for anti-circumvention inquiries to clarify the process and timeline. It also specifies the deadlines for preliminary and final determinations, which currently lack statutory deadlines.\\n\\nThe Level the Playing Field Act 2.0 enjoys strong support from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), the United Steelworkers, and steel manufacturers in Alabama.\\n“This legislation will strengthen the effectiveness of the U.S. trade laws and will give American workers the confidence that their government has every potential tool available to fight for a level playing field against foreign competitors that seek to cheat the system,” said Kevin Dempsey, President and CEO of AISI. “The domestic steel industry appreciates the leadership of Congresswoman Sewell in introducing this critical legislation, which is a companion piece to the bipartisan measure introduced earlier this year by Senators Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman. We urge both Republicans and Democrats to support this crucial bill.”\\nSens. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Rob Portman (R-OH) introduced companion legislation in the Senate.\\xa0\\nThe Level the Playing Field Act 2.0 can be found here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Birmingham, AL – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin in welcoming the U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh to Birmingham, Alabama. The visit was intended to promote the signing of President Biden’s Executive Order 14026 which increases the minimum wage to $15 per hour for federal contractors and the Biden-Harris Administration’s Build Back Better Agenda which includes historic investments in housing construction and rehabilitation, economic development, and community revitalization.\\nThe day began with a visit of Innovation Depot, a startup ecosystem in Birmingham, where Mayor Woodfin, Sec. Walsh, and Rep. Sewell joined University of Alabama-Birmingham President Dr. Ray Watts, leadership from UAB, Innovate Birmingham, and Birmingham Promise for a tour of the facility. Here, they learned about the Birmingham Promise project which provides scholarships and apprenticeships to Birmingham City School students and heard testimonials from former and current students of Innovation Depot.\\xa0\\nNext, Rep. Sewell joined Sec. Walsh, Mayor Woodfin, and two local union workers for a rally in the historic Kelly Ingram Park to celebrate the signing of Executive Order 14026. This was followed by a tour of the park where Sec. Walsh saw the “Four Spirits” memorial to the four little girls who died in the 16th Street Church bombing in 1963. Secretary Walsh later toured the 16th Street Baptist Church.\\xa0\\nThe visit concluded with a tour of The Dannon Project followed by a roundtable with the Mayor Woodfin, Sec. Walsh, Rep. Sewell, the Executive Director of The Dannon Project Kerri Pruitt, and the Alabama Secretary of Labor Fitzgerald Washington.\\xa0\\nRep. Sewell’s remarks from today’s lunch at the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union’s Hall are included below:\\nI want to thank everyone for being here today, especially the Secretary of Labor Martin Walsh!\\xa0Doesn’t he have great passion? I love it! You’re like a breath of fresh air, so thank you for being here Mr. Secretary!\\xa0\\nI want you to know that we’re going to continue fighting in Washington for everyday people. This president promised to deliver, and I am proud of the fact that he’s delivered on three major things. First, he said that he was going to pass the American Rescue Plan and give money directly to counties, cities, and essential workers. Which is exactly what he did in the American Rescue Plan.\\xa0\\nSecondly, he said that he would do infrastructure! The Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill 1.2 trillion dollars will create 2 million, good paying jobs every year in the United States of America. I want to thank all of you for your continued work.\\xa0\\nThe third thing he promised to deliver on is the Build back Better Act that just passed the House of Representatives. This bill was not just about physical infrastructure, it was about social infrastructure and creating that social safety net to ensure that working families can really do what? Work!\\nThat includes childcare, elder care, universal pre-k for our children and also healthcare. Your Congresswoman has been blessed that her bill is in that bill which would help the 12 states that did not expand Medicaid ensure that 300,000 Alabamians have quality health insurance. I will continue that fight.\\xa0\\nI’m also a proud supporter of the PRO Act, which ensures that unions can organize and collective bargain. This intimidation from management must STOP and I want to thank the Amazon workers of Alabama for leading the way on that.\\nIn closing, Secretary Walsh, you are welcome to come back!

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass President Biden’s historic Build Back Better Act, once-in-a-generation legislation to lower costs for hard-working Alabamians, cut taxes for families and workers, and build an economy that puts working families first. Notably, it will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 per year. Among its many provisions, the bill would close the Medicaid coverage gap, create good-paying jobs, lower child care and health care costs, create universal pre-K, establish paid family and medical leave, reduce housing costs, and make the largest investment in combating the climate crisis in American history. The bill passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 220-213 and will now make its way to the U.S. Senate.\\n“Within six weeks of President Biden taking office, we passed the American Rescue Plan to save our economy, crush the pandemic, and deliver critical relief to Americans everywhere,” said Rep. Sewell. “Just last week, we delivered the largest investment in our nation’s infrastructure in nearly a century. Now, with the passage of President Biden’s historic Build Back Better Act, House Democrats are delivering on our promise to build an economy that puts working families first!”\\n“For far too long, those at the very top have seen their fortunes grow while hard-working Americans have been squeezed,” continued Sewell. “Not anymore—I’m proud to report that the Build Back Better Act will uplift Alabama’s most underserved communities with transformational progress! The bill will provide affordable health insurance to Alabamians caught in the coverage gap, lower prescription drug costs, create universal pre-K, extend the Child Tax Credit, address the climate crisis and environmental injustice with bold action, and so much more. Together, President Biden and Congressional Democrats will continue to deliver historic progress for the American people!”\\nThe Build Back Better Act:\\nCreates Millions of Good-Paying Jobs - Together with the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Build Back Better Act will create an average of 2 million jobs per year over the course of the next decade.\\nCuts Taxes for Families and Workers - Prior to the pandemic, 16% of children under the age of 18 in Alabama lived in poverty. The Build Back Better Act will bolster financial security and spur economic growth in Alabama by reducing taxes on the middle class and those striving to break into it. The bill will extend Child Tax Credit (CTC) increases of $300/month per child under 6 or $250/month per child ages 6 to 17. This will continue the largest one-year reduction in child poverty in history. Critically, the agreement includes permanent refundability for the Child Tax Credit, meaning that the neediest families will continue to receive the full Child Tax Credit over the long-run. The bill will also provide a tax cut of up to $1,500 for 274,300 low-wage workers in Alabama by extending the American Rescue Plan’s Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) expansion.\\nCloses the Medicaid Coverage Gap and Provides the Largest Expansion of Affordable Health Care in a Decade - Because states like Alabama refuse to expand Medicaid, about 4 million Americans and nearly 300,000 Alabamians lack health insurance. The Build Back Better Act will close the Medicaid coverage gap by extending through 2025 the enhanced premium subsidies in the ACA Marketplace that were included in the American Rescue Plan. In doing so, it will ensure that every Alabamian and every American in the Medicaid coverage gap has access to affordable health insurance.\\nExpands Medicare with Hearing Coverage for Seniors - Beginning January 1, 2023, the bill allows for qualified audiologists to deliver aural rehabilitation and treatment services under Medicare, in addition to the hearing and balance assessment services provided under current law. It also allows for qualified hearing aid professionals to deliver hearing assessment services under Medicare. The bill also provides for coverage of hearing aids under Medicare Part B forindividuals with moderately severe, severe or profound loss in one or both ears.\\nLowers Prescription Drug Costs - The Build Back Better Act allows the Secretary of HHS to negotiate certain drug prices and halts price hikes above inflation for all Americans. It ensures that Americans with diabetes don’t pay more than $35 per month for their insulin. It also creates a new, out-of-pocket cap of $2,000 on what seniors pay for their drugs in Medicare Part D.\\nLowers Child Care Costs - Working families across Alabama are facing a child care crisis. The high cost of child care is straining family budgets and pushing millions of Alabamians out of the workforce – a majority of whom are women. The lack of affordable child care is also hurting our economy. As workers are forced to stay home, employers are struggling to fill job openings to meet demand and grow their businesses. The Build Back Better Act will dramatically lower the cost of child care for many families. Under the bill, the vast majority of families would not pay more than seven percent of their income on child care, representing an enormous savings from what they pay now. The bill invests a total $390 billion for the child care initiative and the universal preschool initiative. Under the bill, child care providers would also have resources to raise wages for child care workers and expand available supply to serve more children and families.\\nEstablishes Paid Family and Medical Leave - The United States lags behind the rest of the industrialized world when it comes to guaranteeing paid family and medical leave. Only 21 percent of American workers have access to employer-provided paid family leave, and just 42 percent of American workers have access to paid medical leave through an employer-provided plan. The Build Back Better Act establishes a universal and permanent family and medical leave program. The program provides four weeks of paid parental, family caregiving, and medical leave.\\nProvides Universal, High-Quality, Free Pre-K for Every 3- and 4-year old in America - Today, only 23% of 3- and 4-year-olds in Alabama have access to publicly funded preschool, and it costs about $8,600 per year for those who can’t access a publicly-funded program. The Build Back Better Act will enable Alabama to expand access to free, high-quality preschool to more than about 105,000 additional 3- and 4-year-olds per year and increase the quality of preschool for children who are already enrolled. Parents will be able to send their children to the preschool setting of their choice—from public schools to child care providers to Head Start—leading to lifelong educational benefits, allowing more parents to go back to work, and building a stronger foundation for Alabama’s future economic competitiveness.\\nInvests in HBCUs, TCUs and MSIs - The Build Back Better Act invests $3 billion in a competitive grant program to improve the research capacity and research and development infrastructure at four-year Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). The competitive grant program will consist of planning grants for a period of one to two years and implementation grants for a period of one to five years. The bill also invests $6 billion in institutional aid grants to HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, which can be used by these institutions to strengthen their academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities and award need-based financial aid to low-income students.\\nReduces Housing Costs and Expands Housing Options - 260,000 renters in Alabama are rent burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent, while homeownership remains out of reach for many families. The Build Back Better Act will expand rental assistance for Alabama renters, while also increasing the supply of high-quality housing through the construction and rehabilitation of over 1 million affordable housing units nationwide. It will address the capital needs of the entire public housing stock in America and it includes one of the largest investments in down payment assistance in history, enabling more first-generation homebuyers to purchase their first home.\\nMakes the Largest Effort to Combat Climate Change in American History - From 2010 to 2020, Alabama experienced 38 extreme weather events, costing up to $20 billion in damages. The Build Back Better Act is the largest effort to combat climate change in American history, investing $555 billion over 10 years in clean energy and climate investments. It contains green tax credits which will save the average American family hundreds of dollars per year in energy costs. It also Ensures clean energy technology – from wind turbine blades to solar panels to electric cars – will be built in the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of good jobs here at home.\\nFor a comprehensive breakdown of the Build Back Better Act, click here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Tuscaloosa, AL – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced $17,149,167 in funding for the City of Tuscaloosa from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grant program. This funding will be used to support the city’s Tuscaloosa University Boulevard Corridor project, allowing the City of Tuscaloosa in conjunction with the University of Alabama and the Alabama Department of Transportation to make necessary transportation infrastructure improvements.\\n“This is great news for the City of Tuscaloosa and its partners! Investing in our infrastructure provides cities with the revenue they need to not only rebuild but modernize and make room for new innovative development,” said Rep. Sewell. “I applaud the City of Tuscaloosa, the University of Alabama, and the Alabama Department of Transportation for working together to rebuild and revitalize this community. These are the types of funding opportunities that will ensure that the 7th Congressional District can build back better!”\\nBackground:\\nThe City of Tuscaloosa received a federal grant of $17,149,167 from the U.S. Department of Transportation to support the city and its partners, the University of Alabama and the Alabama Department of Transportation, to make transportation infrastructure improvements.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Specifically, the RAISE funding will support the following:\\xa0\\n\\nTechnology upgrades\\nStormwater drainage improvements to address resilience and environmental issues\\nExpand pedestrian access from residential areas to institutional and retail areas\\n\\n“The City of Tuscaloosa could not be more thrilled to be among the recipients of the Department of Transportation’s RAISE Grant. These funds will give us the opportunity to make improvements to one of the major arteries connecting all of Tuscaloosa and will provide better connectivity across our community,” said Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox. “The enhancements that will be made to the University Blvd corridor will include increased storm drain capacity, streetscape enhancements, advancements in security and safety measures, and the inclusion of bike lanes and underground utilities in several locations.”\\nThe Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity, or RAISE Discretionary Grant program, provides a unique opportunity for the DOT to invest in road, rail, transit and port projects that promise to achieve national objectives. Previously known as the Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) and Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Discretionary Grants, Congress has dedicated nearly $8.9 billion for twelve rounds of National Infrastructure Investments to fund projects that have a significant local or regional impact.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) will join President Biden for the signing of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act at the White House. The bill—which passed the House of Representatives on Friday, November 5th—is the largest investment in U.S. infrastructure in nearly a century. As the only member of the Alabama Congressional delegation to vote in favor of the bill, Rep. Sewell played a lead role in securing the inclusion of critical provisions that will benefit Alabama’s 7th District.\\n“Thanks to our hard work, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act contains transformational provisions that will directly benefit the people of Alabama’s 7th District,” said Rep. Sewell. “In addition to creating jobs and rebuilding our roads and bridges, the bill will help alleviate blocked railroad crossings and invest hundreds of millions of dollars in improving Alabama’s water infrastructure. Today, I will proudly stand with President Biden as he signs this bill and delivers these historic wins for the people!”\\nPresident Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act contains several provisions that will address blocked railroad crossings:\\n\\nThe Railroad Crossing Elimination Program - This section would authorize $500 million a year for the new Railroad Crossing Elimination grant program. This includes a small set-aside to carry out a highway-rail grade crossing safety information and education program.\\nBlocked Crossing Portal - This section would require the Federal Railroad Administration to establish a blocked crossing portal to collect information about blocked highway-rail grade crossings from the public. The Federal Railroad Administration is to use the information to assess the impact of blocked crossings, inform outreach to communities and railroads about blocked crossings, and produce an annual report on the program. This pilot program will expire three years after enactment.\\nNational Academies Study On Trains Longer Than 7,500 Feet -This section requires the Secretary to spend between $1 million and $2 million on a report by the National Academies on the operations, safety, and efficiency of trains longer than 7,500 feet, to be submitted to relevant Congressional committees within two years.\\nRailroad point of contact for public safety issues - This section would require all railroads to provide contact information on a public website so that the public could report public safety issues to the railroad.\\n\\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will make transformational investments in Alabama’s water infrastructure.\\xa0\\nCurrently, up to 10 million American households and 400,000 schools and child care centers lack safe drinking water. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, based on the traditional state revolving fund formula, Alabama will expect to receive $782 million over five years to improve water infrastructure across the state and ensure that clean, safe drinking water is a right in all communities. The bill also includes $23 billion nationally for the bipartisan Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act.\\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will also:\\nCreate Millions of Good-Paying Jobs - Together with the Build Back Better Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will create an average of 2 million jobs per year over the course of the next decade.\\nRepair and Rebuild Alabama’s Roads and Bridges - The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Alabama would expect to receive:\\n\\n$5.2 billion for federal-aid highway apportioned programs\\n$225 million for bridge replacement and repairs under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act over five years.\\xa0\\n\\nAlabama can also compete for the $12.5 billion Bridge Investment Program for economically significant bridges and nearly $16 billion of national funding in the bill dedicated for major projects that will deliver substantial economic benefits to communities.\\nConnect Every Alabamian to High-speed Internet - Broadband internet is necessary for Albamians to do their jobs, participate equally in school learning, health care, and to stay connected. Yet 18% of Alabama households do not have an internet subscription, and 11.5% of Alabama residents live in areas where, under the FCC’s benchmark, there is no broadband infrastructure. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Alabama will receive a minimum allocation of $100 million to help provide broadband coverage across the state, including providing access to the at least 565,000 Alabamians who currently lack it. It also makes 1,518,000 Alabamians (31%) eligible for the Affordability Connectivity Benefit, which will help low-income families afford internet access.\\nImprove Healthy, Sustainable Transportation Options - Alabamians who take public transportation spend an extra 66.2% of their time commuting and non-White households are 4.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation. 25% of transit vehicles in the state are past useful life. Based on formula funding alone, Alabama would expect to receive more than $400 million over five years under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to improve public transportation options across the state.\\nInvest in the Future of Electric Vehicle (EV) Travel in Alabama - The bill will build a network of EV chargers to facilitate long-distance travel and provide convenient charging options. The U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) sales is only one-third the size of the Chinese EV market. The bill invests $7.5 billion to build out the first-ever national network of EV chargers in the United States and is a critical element in the Biden-Harris Administration’s plan to accelerate the adoption of EVs to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Alabama would expect to receive $79 million over five years to support the expansion of an EV charging network in the state. Alabama will also have the opportunity to apply for the $2.5 billion in grant funding dedicated to EV charging in the bill.\\nImprove Alabama’s Airports - The United States built modern aviation, but our airports lag far behind our competitors. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, airports in Alabama would receive approximately $140 million for infrastructure development for airports over five years.\\nProtect Alabama’s Infrastructure from Climate Change and Cyber Attacks - The bill will prepare more of Alabama’s infrastructure for the impacts of climate change, cyber-attacks, and extreme weather events. From 2010 to 2020, Alabama has experienced 38 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $20 billion in damages. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, based on historical formula funding levels, Alabama will expect to receive:\\n\\n$23 million over five years to protect against wildfires; and\\xa0\\n$19 million to protect against cyberattacks.\\xa0\\n\\nAlabamans will also benefit from the bill’s historic $3.5 billion national investment in weatherization which will reduce energy costs for families.',\n",

       "  'date': 'October 13, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for approximately 70 million Americans will increase 5.9 percent in 2022 thanks to this year’s cost-of-living adjustment (COLA).\\xa0\\n“As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee’s Subcommittee on Social Security, I have fought for critically important earned benefits for Alabama’s seniors,” said Rep. Sewell. “A nearly 6% cost-of-living adjustment is great news for seniors who have struggled during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this COLA increase is not a substitute for congressional action. Social Security is one of our nation’s most trusted and successful programs and serves as a lifeline for countless Alabamians. I will continue to do everything in my power to protect and expand Social Security so that all workers can retire with dignity.”\\nIn Alabama’s 7th District alone, there are 157,219 Social Security beneficiaries including 9,945 widowers and 16,459 children. For many, Social Security benefits are a lifeline and help cover the costs of basic necessities like food, rent, health care, and medications.\\nThe COLA protects benefits against losing their purchasing power over time when the cost of rent, food, and other expenses increase. Medicare premiums – which are deducted from Social Security checks for most beneficiaries – typically consume much of the COLA increase. One study found that over the past 20 years, the increase in premiums has averaged 5.9 percent annually while COLAs have averaged 2.2 percent annually. Because “a larger and larger chunk of the Social Security benefit goes to health insurance, […] the net benefit available for non-health expenditures does not keep pace with inflation.” This demonstrates that while COLA increases are critical, they are not a substitute for robust congressional action.\\nThe 5.9 percent cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) will begin with benefits payable to more than 64 million Social Security beneficiaries in January 2022. Increased payments to approximately 8 million SSI beneficiaries will begin on December 30, 2021. (Note: some people receive both Social Security and SSI benefits). The Social Security Act ties the annual COLA to the increase in the Consumer Price Index as determined by the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\nSocial Security and SSI beneficiaries are normally notified by mail starting in early December about their new benefit amount. Most people who receive Social Security payments will be able to view their COLA notice online through their personal my Social Security account. People may create or access their my Social Security account online at www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount.\\nThe Social Security Act provides for how the COLA is calculated.

       "  'text': \"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass critical legislation to prevent a first-ever default on the federal debt, which would result in economic catastrophe for nearly every American family. This crucial bill—which Senate Democrats passed on October 7th—will keep the United States under the debt limit through at least December 3rd.\\n“Defaulting on our credit would cause an unprecedented economic collapse, hurting every American and every Alabamian,” said Rep. Sewell. “Contrary to what some would have you believe, suspending the debt limit does not authorize any new spending. This is about paying bills that have piled up under previous administrations including President Trump's. Addressing the debt ceiling is the responsible thing to do, and I was proud to join my Democratic colleagues to protect families from catastrophe and pay our bills.”\\nWith this legislation, which President Biden will soon sign into law, the federal government will be able to continue meeting financial obligations for another two months. This action only addresses previously approved spending, including bipartisan COVID relief, payments to Social Security recipients, payments of veterans’ benefits and paychecks for members of the military, and does not authorize future spending.\\nSenate Republicans continue to block action on a House-passed bill that addresses the debt ceiling through 2022—risking a cataclysmic default that would trigger a global economic collapse and devastate the financial security of nearly every American family.\\xa0 A recent study by Moody’s showed that a debt default would:\\n\\nWipe out $15 trillion in household wealth;\\nErase up to six million jobs; and\\nDouble the unemployment rate, surging up to nine percent.\\n\\n\\xa0Over the last decade, every time the debt limit has needed to be addressed, Congress has acted on a bipartisan basis—including three times under President Trump.\\xa0 Despite Republicans adding $7.8 trillion to the federal debt over the last four years—including a $2 trillion tax cut benefiting the rich—Democrats still helped Republicans address the debt ceiling, because the full faith and credit of the United States must never come under threat.\\nNow, under President Biden, McConnell and many Republicans refuse to join Democrats to address the debt limit even though only 3 percent of the current debt was accumulated under President Biden, and more than 27 percent was incurred under President Trump. This is blatantly hypocritical: just two years ago, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed that“America can't default” because “that would be a disaster.”\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass H.R. 5304. This legislation would extend government funding through December 3, suspend the debt limit to protect the full faith and credit of the United States, and provide emergency funding to address recent natural disasters and the resettlement of Afghan refugees. The bill passed in the House of Representatives today.\\n“This legislation is absolutely essential to the well-being of the United States,” said Rep. Sewell. “In addition to providing critically important emergency funds to address Hurricane Ida and the resettlement of Afghan refugees, it would also prevent a global financial collapse by ensuring the U.S. meets its financial obligations to the world. Supporting this bill is the responsible thing to do, and I was proud to cast my vote for it today.”\\nH.R. 5304 includes provisions that would:\\n\\nExtend Funding for Critical Programs - The Continuing Resolution extends funding for vital federal agencies, including education, health, housing, and public safety programs through December 3.\\xa0 The funding will grow opportunity through early child education, investments in our schools, and high-quality job training programs; provide a lifeline to the vulnerable through nutrition and affordable housing; and honor Congress’ solemn responsibility to secure our nation and support our veterans.\\xa0\\nProvide Emergency Disaster Funding - The emergency disaster funding provides $28.6 billion to address the rising cost of climate change, recent natural disasters including Hurricane Ida, wildfires, severe droughts and winter storms, and other natural and major disasters declared in 2021 and prior years. This funding will help working families, small businesses, and communities get back on their feet and rebuild, while repairing damage to federal facilities.\\nProvide Funding to Support Afghan Refugees - The $6.3 billion supplemental to support Afghan evacuees includes funding to temporarily house evacuees at American facilities and in foreign countries, provide necessary security screenings, and ultimately resettle evacuees in the United States. The legislation also includes funding to provide humanitarian assistance for Afghan refugees in neighboring countries.\\nSuspend the Debt Limit - H.R. 5304 also includes provisions suspending the debt limit through December 2022, in order to meet the obligations that the government has already made and to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.\\n\\nFailure to raise or suspend the debt limit would be catastrophic.\\n\\nFailure to suspend or raise the debt limit would cause the first default in U.S. history.\\nFirst, a default would jeopardize all U.S. government payments, including Social Security payments, veterans’ benefits, military pay, payments to defense contractors, etc.\\nSecondly, a default would hurt all American families by causing interest rates to go up.\\nThirdly, a default could cause a nationwide recession, damaging the livelihoods and savings of millions of working families across the country.\\nFourthly, a default could trigger a worldwide financial crisis. That’s because financial markets currently treat U.S. debt as the safest of assets, with all other assets around the world benchmarked against us. Our default would send waves of financial panic cascading through lots of other markets.\\n\\nAddressing the debt limit is about meeting obligations the government has already made, including the COVID relief legislation from December, as well as vital payments to Social Security recipients and our veterans.\\n\\nA new report shows that only 3 percent of total debt subject to the limit has accumulated under Biden, whereas 27.5 percent of this debt was incurred during the former president’s term.\\nSince 2011, every time the debt limit has needed to be suspended or raised, Congress has suspended or raised it on a bipartisan basis and without incident. Since 2011, Congress has taken this action on a bipartisan basis seven times.',\n",

Sewell. “With this bill, we are cutting taxes for middle class Americans and small businesses, expanding access to child care and healthcare, lowering prescription drug costs, and addressing the growing threat of climate change and environmental injustice. Its historic investments will uplift Alabamians who have been left behind and put us on a path to a more prosperous and equitable future.”\\nThe Ways and Means Committee’s portion of the Build Back Better Act includes measures to:\\n\\nExtend the extremely impactful American Rescue Plan expansion of the Child Tax Credit, and make permanent the American Rescue Plan expansions of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the child and dependent care tax credit;\\nProvide immediate coverage for Americans in the Medicaid coverage gap;\\nExtend the American Rescue Plan’s expanded premium tax credits to help lower health insurance costs;\\nExpanding Medicare coverage to include dental, vision, and hearing benefits, quickly getting new vision and hearing services to beneficiaries in 2022 and 2023, respectively, to eliminate cost and coverage barriers to this care;\\nLower prescription costs for Americans by allowing the HHS Secretary to negotiate for lower drug prices;\\nMitigate wealth inequality and strengthen the progressive power of our tax system by increasing the individual tax rate for high-earners, increasing the top capital gains rate, and adding a modest surtax on the highest-income taxpayers;\\nLevel the playing field by cutting taxes for our nation’s smallest businesses and bringing the corporate rate to 26.5 percent;\\nPromote global competitiveness while ensuring that multinational corporations pay their fair share by better harmonizing the U.S. corporate minimum tax rate with the rate agreed to by over 130 countries in international negotiations;\\nInvest in tax fairness by better equipping the IRS with updated technology and the human capital necessary for the complex audits of high-wealth individuals.\\nSupport clean energy investment and deployment and the creation of good, well-paying jobs;\\nReinstate Build America Bonds and advanced refunding bonds to provide financing to state and local governments and spur investment in the private sector; and\\nExpand proven tax credit programs that encourage economic and affordable housing investments in our communities that are most in need.\\n\\nExpand workplace supports by:\\n\\nProviding up to 12 weeks of universal paid family and medical leave for all U.S. workers;\\nReauthorizing the Health Profession Opportunity Grant (HPOG) program to strengthen this effective health care job training program and making it available nationwide; and\\nInvesting in child care access and equity by:\\n\\nEnsuring that parents and caregivers have the most useful and up-to-date information on available child care options and helping them easily apply for slots;\\nFunding the construction and remodeling of child care facilities to make them even safer and more aligned with public health guidelines; and\\nRaising the wages of child care workers, who currently earn a median wage of $12.24 per hour and often live in poverty.\\n\\n\\n\\nStrengthen retirement security by:\\n\\nRequiring employers without employer-sponsored retirement plans to automatically enroll their employees in IRAs or 401(k)-type plans; and\\nMaking the Saver’s Credit refundable so that those without any income tax liability are eligible to receive the benefit in the form of a contribution to their retirement account.\\n\\nProtect the elderly and people with disabilities in nursing homes by:\\n\\nFunding elder justice programs that increase support for state and local Adult Protective Services offices and long-term care ombudsman programs to better prevent elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation;\\nAddressing the staffing shortages in long-term care facilities by providing funds for recruitment and retention, including wage subsidies, access to child care, tuition reimbursement, and student loan replacement; and\\nImproving the accuracy and reliability of the data collected in these facilities to increase transparency for patients and their families, and strengthen the federal understanding of care quality and reimbursement, and study and update staffing – a key predictor of quality and safety.\\n\\nModernize and reform the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs by:\\n\\nIncreasing benefits and expanding eligibility to meet the needs of today’s workers under TAA for Workers program;\\nReestablishing the TAA for Communities program to target support and initiate proactive outreach in trade-affected communities;\\nDelivering additional funding to the TAA for Community Colleges and Career Training program to better support students served by community colleges;\\nExpanding eligibility, improving outreach, and increasing funding for TAA for Firms to assist firms facing competition from abroad; and\\nImproving outreach and increasing benefits for TAA for Farmers, which hasn’t received new funding in a decade.\\n\\nRep.

       "  'text': \"Birmingham, AL –\\xa0Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin and Birmingham Housing Authority President David Northern, Sr. in welcoming Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge to Birmingham, Alabama. The visit was intended to promote the Biden-Harris Administration’s Build Back Better agenda which includes historic investments in housing construction and rehabilitation, economic development, and community revitalization.\\nThe visit began with a tour of the Villas at Titusville, a newly redeveloped affordable housing community in Birmingham, where Sec. Fudge and Rep. Sewell highlighted President Biden’s plan to build or preserve more than 2 million affordable and sustainable homes nationwide. Such a plan would drive down the costs of housing by dramatically expanding the country’s supply of affordable housing.\\nNext, Rep. Sewell joined Sec. Fudge for a tour of the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute to share a glimpse of Birmingham’s rich civil rights history. This was followed by a roundtable on affordable housing and community revitalization with state and local officials.\\nThe visit concluded with a tour of Southtown Court public housing community.\\nRep. Sewell’s remarks from this morning’s press conference are included below:\\nGood morning Birmingham! What a glorious day to welcome the Secretary of Housing and Development, my dear friend and former colleague Marcia Fudge, the 18th Secretary of HUD, to our wonderful city!\\nI am proud to host my friend and colleague in today’s tour and visit throughout Birmingham so that she can see how far we’ve come. As Secretary, she just toured the villas right here in Titusville and we are very proud of this new development.\\xa0\\nBut as Mayor Woodfin said and we all know, there’s still much work to be done right here in Birmingham and we could use more federal resources to do that work!\\nAs the only member of Alabama’s Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of the American\\xa0Rescue Plan, here’s what I know for a fact. I know that the people I represent need as much assistance as possible to thrive on the other end of this pandemic.\\nI’ve heard them. Mayor Woodfin has heard them, and the Biden Administration has heard them and that is why I am happy to stand here with Secretary Fudge and say that MORE HELP IS ON THE WAY!\\xa0\\nThat means more money.\\xa0\\nAs we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden, his cabinet, and Congressional Democrats have laid out a bold vision for our nation -- one that will help us not just return to the way things were, but instead to Build Back Better, stronger, and more EQUITABLY than before.\\nAs President Biden said himself, the best way to grow our economy is from the bottom up and the middle out, and that’s EXACTLY what we’re doing with the American Rescue Plan resources.\\xa0\\nThe City of Birmingham Alabama received 140 million dollars from the American Rescue Plan and I know that the Mayor and the City Council are hard at work making sure that those resources are there for the citizens of Birmingham to build back better.\\xa0\\nIt will make our lives much better and more affordable housing is one of the tenants of the American Rescue Plan.\\xa0\\nSo what does this mean for Alabama’s 7th Congressional District?\\xa0\\nHere in the 7th district, we’re tough. I’ve often said that what we lack in economic resources, we more than make up in a resilient spirit and hard work ethic and in making sure that we work together for our community.\\xa0 We know that we’ve had systemic DIS-INVESTMENT that has prevented too many of our people from reaching their full potential.\\nWe know that issues like pollution and lack of affordable, quality housing have really set us back. But we also know what’s possible. We see it right at this site. We will see it later at Southtown and the redevelopment that will go on with that as well.\\xa0\\nBut we have a historic opportunity with the American Rescue Plan and this Administration to Build Back Better than before and we must seize this opportunity.\\xa0\\nI’m so proud to join with Secretary Fudge, President Biden, and Congressional Democrats as we finally address these long-standing disparities that exist. The pandemic has only laid bare those disparities. Those disparities exist not only in housing, in healthcare, but in environmental injustice.\\xa0\\nAnd we know that with more resources we can not only build back better housing but build back more efficient and green housing and in doing so save our planet and be more efficient and provide very good, high-paying jobs for our community.\\xa0\\nThe Build Back Better agenda would build or preserve more than 2 million affordable and sustainable homes and would drive down the costs of housing by dramatically expanding our supply of affordable housing.\\nI also want to say that we’re not just doing the talk, we're doing the walk.\\xa0\\nIf you all turned on your televisions this morning you realize that Senate Democrats did pass a 3.5 trillion dollar blueprint that will usher in not only the American Rescue Plan but Biden’s American Jobs Plan and yes, American Family Plan as well. So we look forward to rolling up our sleeves and not just talking the talk but doing the walk.\\xa0\\nI’m also excited about the infrastructure package that passed through the Senate last night. It will include historic investments in Alabama.\\xa0\\nIt includes $5.2 billion in fixing Alabama’s highways. $225 million to repair and replace our failing bridges. And it would invest at least $100 million dollars for broadband.\\xa0\\nIf there’s anything that we’ve realized during this pandemic, it’s that the systemic disinvestment in infrastructure has been a huge disadvantage for communities of color and for low income families. No more. Help is on the way. Help is here. And more help is also on the way.\\xa0\\nI’m excited also that in the infrastructure package we were able to put the largest investment in clean drinking water and wastewater resources in America’s history.\\xa0\\nSo I’m excited to roll those out and look forward to coming back and telling my constituents not only did we do it but we did it well and that Alabama, Birmingham, will not only thrive through this pandemic but also come back and build back better.\\xa0\\nNow I get the honor of introducing my friend and former colleague.\\xa0\\nAs was said, Marcia Fudge brings a unique perspective to being the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. She was the first female and first African American Mayor of Warrensville Heights, Ohio!\\nShe understands very much not only the importance of local government and the needs of local government, but she understands and fights for and did fight for over a decade as the Congresswoman for the 11th District of Ohio.\\xa0\\nIt was an honor to serve with Marcia when she was the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. Throughout her career, Secretary Fudge has been a fierce advocate for low-income families, seniors, and communities across the country. During this challenging time in our nation’s history, there is no one better suited to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development than Secretary Fudge.\\xa0\\nAs we have seen today in the Titusville community, the work of this agency makes a tremendous difference in the lives of so many of our families.\\xa0\\nBut Secretary Fudge is not new to this work. Her foray into electoral politics began in 1999 when she was elected the first female and first African American Mayor of Warrensville Heights, Ohio. Among her many accomplishments as Mayor, Secretary Fudge adopted one of the first vacant and abandoned property ordinances in the state and helped to combat predatory lending. She also helped to address the city’s growing foreclosure crisis and prioritized improving the City’s tax base and expanded opportunities for affordable housing.\\nI am very excited, with no further ado, to introduce the 18th Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, none other than the distinguished Marcia Fudge!\\nBackground\\nToday’s events follow two significant milestones in the rollout of President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda and the fight to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure.\\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Senate passed President Biden’s $1 trillion infrastructure bill, a bipartisan agreement to make the largest long-term investment in our country’s infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century. This investment will grow the economy, create good jobs, enhance our competitiveness, and make our economy more sustainable, resilient, and equitable.\\xa0\\nAmong its many provisions:\\n\\nAlabama would expect to receive\\xa0$5.2 billion\\xa0for federal-aid highway apportioned programs and\\xa0$225 million\\xa0for bridge replacement and repairs over five years.\\nAlabama would receive a minimum allocation of\\xa0$100 million\\xa0to help provide broadband coverage across the state.\\nThe bill makes the\\xa0largest investment in clean drinking water and wastewater infrastructure\\xa0in American history, replacing all of the nation’s lead pipes and delivering clean water to millions of families.\\n\\nThis morning, the Senate also passed a budget resolution paving the way for congressional Democrats’ $3.5 trillion reconciliation package which is expected to include additional programs to drive down costs for hard-working families, expand access to health care, and invest in affordable housing and climate resiliency.\",\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that she secured the inclusion of over $7.8 million for eight community projects in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District in House Democrats’ FY2022 government funding bills. With the passage of these bills in the House of Representatives this week, funding for these community projects has cleared a key hurdle. The bills must now face negotiations in the Senate.\\n“I fought hard to secure funding for community projects in Alabama’s 7th District in the 2022 government funding bills, and I am beyond thrilled to announce that over $7.8 million was included for projects in our district,” said Rep. Sewell. “By including funding for these projects, House Democrats are bypassing bureaucracy and getting money directly into the community where it’s needed. I am hopeful that the Senate will swiftly approve this funding and I look forward to seeing President Biden sign it into law.”\\nIn April, Rep. Sewell submitted requests to the House Appropriations Committee to fund\\xa0community projects\\xa0in Alabama’s 7th District. Funding for eight of these projects, totaling\\xa0$7,829,355, was included in House Democrats’ appropriations package that passed in the House this week. The bills will now make their way to the Senate where they will face additional negotiations before being passed and signed into law by President Biden. Rep. Sewell looks forward to her other community project funding requests being included in Appropriations bills still pending before the House of Representatives.\\nRep. Sewell secured funding, totaling $7,829,355.00, for the following community projects in the House’s government funding bills:\\n*NOTE: Funding for these projects must still be passed by the Senate.\\n\\nJefferson County - Greater Shiloh Baptist Church - Employment and Training Project\\n\\nRecipient: Cornerstone Revitalization Foundation, Inc.\\nAward: $1,500,000.00\\nProject: To reduce recidivism, CWD will afford adults ages 25 and older opportunities to learn trade and technical skills. Participants will also have the opportunity to get their GED and pursue post-secondary education opportunities and help with obtaining affordable housing. The program is about assisting participants with not just jobs but careers.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nJefferson County - North Birmingham Community Development Rehabilitation Project\\n\\nRecipient: City of Birmingham\\nAward: $3,000,000.00\\nProject: The North Birmingham Community has suffered from environmental justice concerns for over a century. A largely redlined area, the community includes multiple coal refinement operations, the 35th Avenue Superfund site, and parts of the community sustain flood damage regularly. This project would remove environmental concerns in the old North Birmingham Elementary School.\\xa0The redevelopment of the North Birmingham site would provide a transformative redevelopment investment in North Birmingham.\\n\\n\\nJefferson County - Small Business Accelerator Program\\n\\nRecipient: Central Alabama Redevelopment Alliance\\nAward: $474,355.00\\nProject: The Small Business Accelerator provides micro companies and small businesses access to instructional workshops, key resource providers, and other support to help them expand and create jobs for the local community.\\xa0The Accelerator helps Alabama small businesses establish core systems and processes that would allow their business to survive a natural disaster, economic downturn, or other business interruptions.\\n\\n\\nLowndes County - Wastewater Disposal Treatment System Project\\n\\nRecipient: Lowndes County Unincorporated Wastewater Program\\nAward: $700,000.00\\nProject: Failing septic tanks and deteriorating wastewater infrastructure in Lowndes County have left many families with untreated sewage in their yards and in local waterways.\\xa0This is not only an infrastructure crisis, but a healthcare crisis. This funding would facilitate the installation of septic tanks for homes in unincorporated areas without proper wastewater disposal systems.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nPerry County – Drinking Water Infrastructure Project\\n\\nRecipient: City of Marion\\nAward: $480,000.00\\nProject: The improvement of the City of Marion’s water infrastructure is critical to the health and economic vitality of the community. Failures of the water system after recent natural disasters have threatened the continued operation of local institutions like Marion Military Institute and Judson College. These funds will help provide functional water systems to a community that is combating intergenerational poverty in the Black Belt.\\n\\n\\nSumter County - Hill Hospital Construction Project\\n\\nRecipient: Hill Hospital\\nAward: $575,000.00\\nProject: For several years, Hill Hospital has faced persistent challenges to provide comprehensive health care to the citizens in Sumter County. Geographic isolation, economic fluctuations, and the COVID 19 pandemic have magnified these challenges. This funding will improve the facilities and patient rooms at Hill Hospital so they can continue to serve the county and provide healthcare to the rural community. The long-term viability of Hill Hospital will prevent residents from traveling to other counties and states to seek health care.\\n\\n\\nTuscaloosa County - Community Health Worker Initiative\\n\\nRecipient: West Central Alabama Area Health Education Center\\nAward: $300,000.00\\nProject: The Community Health Worker Initiative will develop and implement a training program throughout Alabama to improve access to healthcare, increase community resilience, and promote health education in rural areas.\\xa0Nearly half of Alabama’s state population lives in a rural county, and on average, those individuals are more likely to be low-income, uninsured, and suffer from higher rates of chronic health conditions.\\xa0This program will help aid these communities while also addressing the primary care, dental, and mental health workforce shortage in Alabama.\\n\\n\\nTuscaloosa County -\\xa0TRAMS CORE Improvement of Postsecondary Education\\n\\nRecipient: Stillman College\\nAward: $800,000.00\\nProject: The Translational and Mechanistic Science for Collaborative Organic Research Environment (TRAMS CORE) program addresses traditional roadblocks for research and will provide a platform to generate new research efforts on the campus of a HBCU.

       "  'text': 'Washington D.C.\\xa0 – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to strengthen protections for consumers by passing H.R. 2668, the Consumer Protection and Recovery Act. This critical bill restores the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) authority to go to court to get victimized consumers and businesses their money back from scammers and other lawbreakers after the Supreme Court gutted the agency’s authority earlier this year. The bill passed in the House of Representatives amid a surge in scams and fraud during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n“Too often, scammers prey on society’s most vulnerable, particularly our seniors, veterans, small businesses, and the disabled,” said Rep. Sewell. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen a surge in this type of illegal activity.”\\n“This is simple,” continued Sewell. “When hard-working Alabamians fall victim to financial scams, the FTC should have the authority to step in and return them their money. That’s why I was proud to support the Consumer Protection and Recovery Act and thrilled to see it pass the House today. With this bill, we are sending a clear message: government must work for the people.”\\nFor more than forty years, the FTC used section 13(b) of the FTC Act to return money taken by scammers, fraudsters, and other lawbreakers to consumers. In fact, in the last three years alone, the FTC returned $11.5 billion to nearly 10 million consumers across every state. Those benefiting most often include senior citizens, veterans, small businesses, and the most vulnerable members of society, all of whom tend to be the most frequent victims of scams and other fraudulent activities.\\nHowever, on April 22, 2021, that monetary relief for consumers stopped when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that section 13(b) of the FTC Act is limited to stopping or mandating certain conduct and does not allow the FTC to seek equitable monetary relief or require bad actors to return money earned through illegal activity – despite the fact that the FTC had been doing so for over forty years.\\nThe Consumer Protection and Recovery Act restores the FTC’s authority to seek monetary relief as it had been successfully doing for over forty years by amending section 13(b) of the FTC Act to provide the FTC with express authority to obtain both injunctive and monetary equitable relief, including monetary redress for consumers in court for all violations of the laws FTC enforces. The bill also makes explicit that the FTC may pursue many kinds of equitable relief, including restitution for losses, contract reformation and rescission, monetary refunds, and the refund of property, as well as forcing bad actors to return their ill-gotten gains.\\nThe Consumer Protection and Recovery Act receives widespread support from key groups including:\\n\\nAFL-CIO\\nAmericans for Financial Reform\\nConsumer Federation of America\\nConsumer Reports\\nConsumer Action\\nNational Consumers League\\nNational Association of Consumer Advocates\\nNational Consumer Law Center\\nPrivacy Rights Clearinghouse\\nPublic Citizen\\nU.S. PIRG\\nCouncil for Civil Justice and Consumer Rights\\nVeterans for Common Sense\\nVeterans Education Success\\nCenter for Digital Democracy\\nCenter for Justice & Democracy\\nAccess Now\\nTruthinAdvertising.org\\nNew America’s Open Technology Institute\\nMedia Alliance\\nCommon Sense Media\\nFairplay\\nPublic Law Center\\nPublic Good Law Center\\nPublic Justice\\nPublic Knowledge\\n\\nIn addition, a number of business groups support the bill, including:\\n\\nThe American Association of Franchisees and Dealers\\nFair Franchising Initiative\\nNational Coalition of Associations of 7-Eleven Franchisees\\nNational TUPSSO Franchise Owners Association (UPS Stores)',\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) is encouraging hardworking families to be on the lookout for monthly payments from the Child Tax Credit of up to $300 per month per child beginning July 15th through December. 43,700 hard-working households, covering 93.5% of all children in Alabama’s 7th District, could get up to $300 per month per child July-December and even more after filing their taxes next year.\\n“I know that many parents, grandparents, and guardians in Alabama have struggled to afford food, child care, health care, and other necessities long before this pandemic,” said Rep. Sewell. “That’s why I fought to include an expansion of the Child Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan which House and Senate Democrats passed and President Biden signed into law in March.”\\n“I cannot overstate how transformational the expanded Child Tax Credit will be,” continued Sewell. “Starting today, hard-working Alabama families will receive monthly payments to afford housing, food, health care, child care, and other expenses. With the Child Tax Credit, we’re investing in our greatest asset, our children, by cutting child poverty in half and putting our kids on a path to success.”\\xa0\\nIn the State of Alabama, the Child Tax Credit is expected to:\\n\\nBenefit 91% of children (or 1,004,200)\\xa0\\nImpact 316,400 households\\nLift 82,700 children out of poverty\\nLift 43,100 children out of deep poverty\\n\\nIn Alabama’s 7th District, the Child Tax Credit is expected to:\\n\\nBenefit 93.5% of children (or 138,300)\\xa0\\nImpact 43,700 households with an average benefit of $3,200 per household\\nLift 14,200 children out of poverty\\nLift 7,200 children out of deep poverty\\n\\nAccording to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, the expanded Child Tax Credit could cut child poverty in the United States by more than half.\\nNearly all hardworking families should get their monthly payments automatically beginning July 15th with no further action required. Families who did not file a tax return for 2019 or 2020 and who did not use the IRS non-filers tool last year to sign up for the Economic Impact Payments, should go online and use the IRS Child Tax Credit Non-filer Sign-up Tool to sign up today.\\n\\xa0\\nMajor Tax Relief for Nearly All Working Families:\\nHow Much Is the Child Tax Credit Expansion from the American Rescue Plan?\\nThe American Rescue Plan expanded the Child Tax Credit to up to $3,600 per child for children ages 0 to 5 and $3,000 per child for children ages 6 to 17.\\xa0\\nThe American Rescue Plan also authorized advance monthly payments of the Child Tax Credit through December 2021.\\xa0 Beginning in July and running through December, qualifying families can get up to:\\xa0\\n\\n$300 per month per child for children ages 0 to 5.\\n$250 per month per child for children ages 6 to 17\\n\\nFamilies will get their remaining expanded Child Tax Credit when they file their 2021 tax return.\\xa0\\nWho Qualifies?\\nFamilies with children will qualify for a full credit if their income is below $75,000 for single filers, $112,000 for people filing as head of household, or $150,000 for people who are married and filing jointly.\\nHow Do I Get My Payment?\\nNearly all hardworking families should get their monthly payments automatically beginning July 15th with no further action required. If you’ve filed tax returns for 2019 or 2020, or if you signed up to receive a stimulus check from the Internal Revenue Service, you will get this tax relief automatically. You do not need to sign up or take any action.\\nFamilies who did not file a tax return for 2019 or 2020 and who did not use the IRS Non-filers tool last year to sign up for the Economic Impact Payments, should go online and use the IRS Child Tax Credit Non-filer Sign-up Tool to sign up today.\\nFamilies who got their refunds from the IRS through direct deposit will get these payments in their bank account around the 15th of every month until the end of 2021. People who don’t use direct deposit will receive their payment by mail around the same time.\\nFamilies will be able to determine their eligibility, check the status of their payments and more at IRS.gov/childtaxcredit2021 later this month.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWatch out for scams\\nAccording to IRS.gov: “The IRS urges everyone to be on the lookout for scams related to both Advance Child Tax Credit payments and Economic Impact Payments. The IRS emphasized that the only way to get either of these benefits is by either filing a tax return with the IRS or registering online through the Non-filer Sign-up tool, exclusively on IRS.gov. Any other option is a scam.\\nWatch out for scams using email, phone calls or texts related to the payments. Be careful and cautious: The IRS never sends unsolicited electronic communications asking anyone to open attachments or visit a non-governmental web site.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced over $7 million in federal funding for Head Start programs serving Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. This funding will allow Head Start programs to continue preparing Alabama children for success and will grow our economy by helping caregivers get back to work knowing their children are safe and cared for.\\n“Our children are our future and our greatest asset,” said Rep. Sewell. “Tragically, the COVID-19 pandemic deprived too many Alabama children of a safe, supportive learning environment, causing them to fall behind in their educational journeys.”\\n“The best way to put our country on a path to prosperity is by investing in the next generation of change-makers,” continued Sewell. “I’m so proud to announce that Head Start programs serving children in Alabama’s 7th District will receive over $7 million from the American Rescue Plan. This funding will help us bounce back from the devastation of the past year by getting parents back to work and providing our children the tools they need to grow and thrive.”\\nFunding, which totals $7,170,627 was awarded to the following Head Start programs serving Alabama’s 7th Congressional District.\\nHead Start programs serving only Alabama’s 7th District:\\n\\nPickens County Community Action Committee and Community Development Corporation, Inc. - $271,606\\nSumter County Opportunity, Inc. -\\xa0 $579,106\\nLowndes Co.

Sewell helped secure through the American Rescue Plan (previously announced) to keep Alabama’s child care providers on the job and keep costs down for working families.\\nThe American Rescue Plan also includes a historic increase in support for child care through the tax code, helping millions of working families afford needed care. Rep. Sewell played a critical role in drafting the expansions of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan, which are projected to cut child poverty in the United States in half. More information on the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit can be found here.\\nHow local Head Start programs are using funding from the American Rescue Plan\\n“The 2020 school year was very challenging,” said Cynthia Simpson, Executive Director of Pickens County Community Action. “We, like many other schools, elected to offer virtual learning to protect our staff and most importantly, our little people. We understand the burden this may have caused and the educational setback, so we are proud to offer the Pickens County Summer Learning Program for our students. The American Rescue Plans has provided the opportunity to offer summer learning to ensure our 4-year-olds are prepared for the transition to kindergarten. We were also able to purchase PPE and an additional bus to provide necessary space for support staff and students during transport to and from school.”\\n“The Blackbelt Community Foundation has been overwhelmed with requests for support from our communities,” said Felicia Lucky, President of the Blackbelt Community Foundation. “Funds made possible by the American Rescue Plan have allowed us to bridge the digital divide that was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We were able to purchase laptops to keep our children and staff safe as we all worked to decrease the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Most importantly, we have been able to extend necessary resources for the communities supported by the Blackbelt Community Foundation in Choctaw, Dallas, Marengo, and Wilcox counties. This ensures our children have the tools necessary to navigate educational requirements during these unprecedented times.”\\xa0\\n“The Lowndes County Head Start plans on using the funds from the American Rescue Plan to provide mental health support for children, families, and our staff as well as opportunities for professional development,” said Lashica Mason, Fiscal Manager for Lowndes County Head Start. “The funds will also help purchase cleaning supplies and new playground equipment.”\\nBackground on Head Start Programs\\nHead Start programs promote the school readiness of infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children from low-income families. Services are provided in a variety of settings including centers, family child care, and a child’s own home. Programs also engage parents or other key family members in positive relationships, with a focus on family wellbeing. Head Start programs provide services through 1,600 agencies in local communities and serve more than one million children per year in every state and U.S. territory. Most are run by non-profit organizations, schools, and community action agencies.',\n",

       "  'date': 'June 29, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. –\\xa0This Congress, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Buddy Carter (GA-01), introduced H.R. 4210, the Disaster Reforestation Act of 2021. This legislation would help family and private timber growers recover from the loss of timber destroyed by natural disasters and reforest their lands.\\n“Alabama’s beautiful forests keep our economy, our environment, and our people healthy,”\\xa0said Rep. Sewell.\\xa0“But when disaster strikes, our private forest owners are often left devastated and without the ability to quickly recover. By fixing our tax code, the Disaster Reforestation Act offers a helping hand to Alabama’s private forest owners as they work to reforest after natural disasters. I am so proud to introduce this legislation and urge my colleagues to support it.”\\n“Forestry is a vital part of rural economies all across our country,”\\xa0said Rep. Carter, lead Republican co-sponsor.\\xa0“Unfortunately the current tax code provides no recourse for working forests struck by natural disasters.\\xa0I’m proud to work with Congresswoman Sewell and our partners from across the country to address this issue.\\xa0The Disaster Reforestation Act will ensure timber farming is a viable way of life, protecting the many jobs and consumer products it supports and its positive impact to our environment.”\\nAlabama’s private forest owners own 21 million acres of private forestland which are critical to the state’s economic and environmental health. Currently, Alabama’s private forests support $28 billion in economic activity and 119,000 jobs, contribute $906 million in tax revenue, and provide safe drinking water for 1.4 million Alabamians. They also help combat climate change by sequestering carbon emissions and releasing oxygen.\\xa0\\nUnfortunately, Alabama’s private forest landowners—many of which are families and small timber companies that produce products like lumber—face immense financial burdens when needing to reforest their lands after a natural disaster, which is often compounded at tax time when private forest owners find their ability to claim a casualty loss for destroyed timber is limited, often to zero dollars.\\xa0\\nThe Disaster Reforestation Act would reduce this financial burden by providing for the equitable tax treatment of casualty loss of their timber crop when disaster strikes. In doing so, it would foster stability and growth in one of Alabama’s key industries and promote environmental wellness through reforestation.\\n“The economic impact of the forestry sector in Alabama is critically reliant on forest landowners’ ability to supply timber to our mills; especially here in Rural Southwest Alabama,”\\xa0said Sheldon Day, Mayor of Thomasville, Alabama.\\xa0“Congresswoman Sewell has proven time and time again that she understands the needs of her forestry constituents. The City of Thomasville sincerely appreciates her leadership in championing the Disaster Reforestation Act.”\\xa0\\n“This legislation is key in helping family forest owners recover after natural disasters and keeping Alabama’s forests as forests,”\\xa0said\\xa0Gray Skipper, Alabama Landowner and VP of Scotch Plywood Company. “This will ensure the forest products consuming mills have trees in the future to maintain local economies. It will also ensure these forests, some of which are the most biologically diverse in the country, can continue sequestering carbon, supporting at-risk species, providing the clean water supply, and recreation for Gulf communities.”\\n“Alabama’s 23 million acres of healthy forests supply the raw material for the state’s $28 billion forest industry that creates jobs for 123,000 Alabama workers,”\\xa0said Chris Isaacson, President & CEO of Alabama Forestry Association.\\xa0“The investment required by forest landowners over the decades from planting to harvest is at constant risk from natural disasters.\\xa0Under the current tax code, when disaster strikes landowners lose twice.\\xa0They lose their timber\\xa0and\\xa0they lose the ability to deduct the value of the timber damaged.\\xa0 We are grateful that Congresswoman Sewell recognizes this inequity and applaud her for taking a leadership role in helping landowners and their local communities recover.”\\n“America’s forest landowners have been waiting for this vital fix in the tax code and are appreciative of Representative Sewell and Carter’s efforts to introduce the Disaster Reforestation Act,”\\xa0said Scott Jones, CEO of the Forest Landowners Association.\\xa0“The legislation will not only help timber owners recover from natural disasters but will stimulate rural economies and support our nation’s domestic timber supply.”\\nThe Disaster Reforestation Act receives widespread support from national forestry stakeholders including:\\n\\nThe Forest Landowners Association\\nThe Southern Group of State Foresters\\nThe American Forest Foundation\\nThe National Association of State Foresters\\nThe Society of American Foresters\\nF&W Forestry Services\\nThe Association of Consulting Foresters,\\nThe National Alliance of Forest Owners.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Darin LaHood (IL-18) introduced bipartisan legislation to boost post-graduation scholarships and strengthen workforce recruitment in rural America. The Workforce Development Through Post-Graduation Scholarships Act of 2021 would amend the Internal Revenue Service Code to exclude certain post-graduation scholarship grants from being treated as gross income which will alleviate student loan debt, help businesses attract and recruit talent, and boost economic growth in local communities.\\n“By attracting talented workers to jobs in Alabama’s rural and underserved communities, post-graduate scholarship grants play a critical role in boosting local economic growth and fostering prosperity, all while alleviating the burden of student debt,” said Rep. Sewell. “I’m proud to be introducing this legislation, which will ensure that these awards are effective tools for businesses and workers in Alabama’s 7th District.”\\n“In our modern economy, it’s essential we recruit talent into our workforce in underserved and rural communities and provide workers with the resources they need,\" said Rep. LaHood, lead Republican co-sponsor. \"Our legislation will alleviate the growing student debt, foster economic growth, and help organizations attract better talent and reward professionals who commit to their local communities.\"\\nA post-graduation scholarship is a type of charitable grant made by foundations to attract individuals with certain career skills to a given region. It functions much like a traditional scholarship but would pay off a portion of student loans held by an individual who has already completed a degree or technical program.\\nMuch like a traditional scholarship, the issuing foundation would establish appropriate eligibility requirements and put in place a process to verify that those requirements continue to be met through the duration of the scholarship award agreement. For example, a foundation that is looking to attract nurses or doctors to a community facing a shortage of qualified health professionals could award a post-graduation scholarship to a recipient but require that an individual live and be employed within a range of ZIP codes for a set number of years.\\xa0\\nThe Workforce Development Through Post-Graduation Scholarships Act of 2021 would amend the Internal Revenue Service Code to exclude certain post-graduation scholarship grants from being treated as gross income which would increase the effectiveness of these awards by reducing the burden of student debt and boosting economic growth.\\nThe bill already enjoys broad support from across the philanthropic sector.\\n“The student debt crisis is damaging the financial futures of American students and families,\" said Kathleen Enright, President & CEO of the Council on Foundations. \"For rural communities where it can be more difficult to attract or retain people with the skills to fill needed jobs, post-graduation scholarships are a great incentive for recent graduates to come back home or move to places they may not have previously considered. The Workforce Development Through Post-Graduation Scholarships Act provides foundations with tools to help attract talent to meet the needs in their communities. This legislation is a result of years of collaboration between members of Congress and philanthropic leaders, and I urge Congress to send this bill to the President’s desk to sign into law immediately.”\\nCompanion legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sens.

This is a common-sense bill that will make it easier for part-time employees to begin contributing to their retirement accounts sooner in their employment,”\\xa0said Rep. Sewell.\\xa0“We know that Alabama’s working families are facing a retirement crisis. Too often, the incentives to save for retirement are designed to benefit the wealthy and the upper-middle class.\\xa0 This is a fundamental inequity in our tax code, and we must rebalance retirement incentives so that all working individuals can retire with dignity and financial security.”\\n“I am also pleased that my bill was included in H.R. 2954, the SECURE Act 2.0, which passed out of the Ways and Means Committee this week,”\\xa0continued Sewell.\\xa0“This larger package includes a number of provisions that will expand retirement coverage and increase participation in retirement savings by realigning savings incentives to benefit middle class and working class families. In my district, where the median household income is $38,000 a year, saving for retirement can seem overwhelming. That is why I am committed to breaking down traditional barriers to saving for retirement.”\\nBackground on H.R. 2944\\nThe Reducing the Maximum Service Requirement for Long-term Part-time Workers to Make Elective Deferrals to 401(k) Plans Act amends the long-term part-time years of service 401(k) participation requirement included in the 2019 SECURE Act. As women are more likely to work part-time than men, this provision is particularly important for women in the workforce. The SECURE Act provides that except in the case of collectively bargained plans, employers maintaining a 401(k) plan must have a dual eligibility requirement under which an employee must complete either a one year of service requirement (with the 1,000-hour rule) or\\xa0three\\xa0consecutive years of service where the employee completes at least 500 hours of service. H.R. 2944 reduces the three-year rule to two years, allowing for part-time employees to begin saving for retirement sooner.\\nH.R. 2944 can be found\\xa0here.',\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced over $732 million in additional federal funding to the State of Alabama through the American Rescue Plan. This funding will help child care providers open safely, keep workers on the payroll and lower child care costs for hardworking families.\\xa0\\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a child care crisis. Across Alabama, providers have been forced to lay off and furlough workers just to stay afloat.”\\xa0said Rep. Terri Sewell. “At the same time, hardworking families have been struggling to access basic child care services. That’s why I am thrilled to announce over $732 million in additional federal funding for child care through the American Rescue Plan. This funding will provide a critical lifeline to our child care providers and will help our economy bounce back by getting parents back to work.”\\nThe total amount of\\xa0$732,997,365\\xa0comes as part of two programs through the American Rescue Plan:\\xa0\\n\\n$451,360,337 from the Child Care Stabilization Fund\\xa0to help child care providers reopen or stay open, provide safe and healthy learning environments, keep workers on payroll, and provide mental health support for educators and children.\\n$281,637,028 in flexible funding from the Child Care Development Fund\\xa0to help Alabama make child care more affordable for more families, increase access to high-quality care for families receiving subsidies, increase compensation for early childhood workers, and meet other care needs in the state.\\xa0\\n\\nThe American Rescue Plan also includes a historic increase in support for child care through the tax code, helping millions of working families afford needed care. Rep. Sewell played a critical role in drafting the expansions of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan, which are projected to cut child poverty in the United States by more than a half:\\nLast year, a family claiming a Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) got less than $700 on average towards the cost of care, and many low-income working families often got nothing. Thanks to the historic expansion of the CDCTC in the American Recovery Plan, a median income family in Alabama with two kids under age 13 will receive up to $8,000 towards their child care expenses when they file taxes for 2021, compared with a previous maximum of $1,200.\\xa0\\n\\nIn 2020, the CDCTC provides a tax credit typically capped at $600 for one child for families with at least $3,000 in eligible expenses, and capped at $1,200 for two children or more for families with at least $6,000 in child care expenses.\\nUnder the American Rescue Plan’s expansion of the CDCTC, all families with incomes below $125,000 will save up to half the cost of their eligible child care expenses, getting back up to $4,000 for one child and $8,000 for two or more children when they file taxes for 2021. Furthermore, families making between $125,000 and $438,000 can receive a partial credit.\\nFor the first time, the CDCTC will be fully refundable, making the credit fairer by allowing low-income working families to receive the full value of the credit towards their eligible child care expenses regardless of how much they owe on their 2021 taxes.\\n\\nMore details can be found\\xa0here.',\n",

This gap not only hurts women in our workforce, but threatens our state's economic growth.

In Alabama, the wage gap is even larger – 74 cents on the dollar, amounting to an annual gap of $12,857.

       "  'text': 'Birmingham, AL - Today, Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) welcomed First Lady of the United States Dr. Jill Biden to Birmingham to highlight the historic reduction in child poverty that will be achieved thanks to the American Rescue Plan. Rep. Sewell played a critical role in drafting the expansions of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan, which are projected to cut child poverty in the United States by more than a half.\\xa0\\nRep. Terri Sewell: Good afternoon Birmingham! What a great day to welcome Dr. Jill Biden, the First Lady of the United States, to our wonderful city of Birmingham.\\xa0\\nAs the only member of the Alabama Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of the 1.9 trillion dollar American Rescue Plan, here’s what I know for a fact: the people that I represent need assistance to get through COVID-19. I heard from them, and I know that they need money to be able to afford food on their tables and resources to make sure that they are equitably receiving the vaccine.\\xa0\\nThank God that because of the American Rescue Plan, 1.9 trillion dollars were able to put shots in arms and in record time. You know the Biden-Harris Administration said that they were going to do 100 million shots in arms by the first 100 days. We were able to do it in 58 days! We also know that we needed direct funds to our state but also to our counties and our cities. I heard you Mr. Mayor and all of our mayors across the 7th Congressional District when they said they wanted direct resources and I am proud to announce that help is here!\\nToday I am thrilled to talk about another aspect of the American Rescue Plan. We knew that it was critically important that we help families, the whole family. We knew how important it was to help our children so the second round of $600 that went out in December, as well as the $1400 that went out just 2 weeks ago, include resources not just for the adults in the family, but for the children in the family as well. Through this plan, a family of 4 would receive not just the $1,400 for mom and dad, but for their children as well. That’s $5600 for an average family of four.\\xa0\\nToday I am proud to be right here at the YWCA and I want to thank LaRhonda and all of your staff for hosting us today. We started off at the James Rushton Early Learning Center at Woodlawn and I want to thank them and the Woodlawn Foundation for allowing us to see firsthand how our children are not only learning but they are thriving even in the midst of this pandemic. And that’s what it’s about.\\xa0\\nUnder the leadership of LaRohanda and so many others, the YWCA of Central Alabama has had a profound impact on countless families and children in our region. As I said earlier today, we were at the Woodlawn Foundation’s James Rushton Early Learning Center, where we toured a classroom and met with children who are benefiting every day from this institution. For years they have dedicated themselves to revitalizing the community of Woodlawn and they are doing it. They’re not just talking about it—they are about it!\\nAlso, I am thrilled to be with Alabama Child Advocate Liz Huntley who will introduce Dr. Biden in a minute. She is among the countless local leaders that are present here today as we talk about child poverty and the fact that the American Rescue Plan deals will deal with that directly.\\xa0\\nI see my dear friend, Senator Doug Jones: You will always be my Senator! And his lovely wife, Louise, thank you.\\xa0\\nThe Biden Administration knows that the time is now to address the systemic inequities that have left so many families struggling to make it. Together with Congressional Democrats, we passed the American Rescue Plan because of our fundamental belief that good governance creates an environment that allows all of our people to reach their full potential. If we’ve learned anything during this pandemic, it’s that we cannot wait a single day to provide resources to America’s working and struggling families to try and level the playing field, especially for our children. That is why I\\'m so proud to have been the only Democrat in Alabama’s Delegation to vote in favor of the 1.9 trillion dollar American Rescue Plan.\\xa0\\nWe know that one of the greatest contributors to the opportunity gap between children in communities like the one we’re in right now and the ones in wealthy neighborhoods across the nation is the financial investment the parents are able to make in their children. Every parent I met in my district, irrespective of zip code, wanted the best for their children, but they struggle day in and day out just to make ends meet. They fall behind when it matters most and we know that we need additional resources for our public schools.\\nI am proud that we are investing in our public schools not just immediately but also acknowledging that we need remedial help as well. Our children learn best in the classroom and we all know that which is why the American Rescue Plan will be giving direct assistance to individual school systems such as Jefferson County Public Schools and the City of Birmingham Public Schools. That is hundreds of millions of dollars and that money will be earmarked to not only deal with COVID-19 relief now to get our children back into schools safely, but also to deal with the remedial learning that we know our children will need. And so I want you all to know that the American Rescue Plan is truly that: a rescue plan to deal with COVID-19 and make sure our communities not only survive this pandemic, but they thrive through it!\\nAs of 2019, 34% of the children in my district lived below the poverty line and 53% of those children, that\\'s over half of the children in America, do not receive the full benefits of the Child Tax Credit because it isn’t fully refundable. We know that our response has to be big and bold in this rescue plan.\\xa0\\nIt is important that we use every tool in the toolbox to deal with this pandemic and to provide relief. As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, our jurisdiction is taxes. It is the revenue-generating operation of the House, and we thought that it was critically important that we make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable.\\xa0\\nWhat do I mean by that? By making this Child Tax Credit fully refundable, we are reaching the neediest of families. We are not only doing that, we are also expanding it by providing direct payments in the form of a child allowance. This year families will receive $3,600 per child under the age of 6 and $3,000 per child for children between the ages of 6 and 16. These payments will be made on a recurring monthly basis with families receiving their first checks hopefully in July.\\xa0\\nThis is about saving working families and ensuring our children get out of poverty. As a lifelong educator, I know that Dr. Jill Biden has dedicated herself to transforming the lives of American children. Now, as the First Lady, she has taken the same vigor and applied it to eradicating child poverty. We know that just by making the Child Tax Credit fully refundable that we can lift 40% of the children living below the poverty line above it. The American Rescue Plan not only provides help, but it also uplifts our community and it does so for our children as well.\\xa0\\nI want to say in closing that it was Martin Luther King that said, “poverty is a state of mind but, it also is a state of existence\" and we in the greatest country in the world, should not have anyone living in poverty. We need to figure out a way that we can provide the resources so that every child can grow up and reach their fullest potential. We see that with the wonderful children here at the YWCA and we saw that at the James Rushton Early Learning Center.\\xa0\\nI am so happy that Dr. Jill Biden chose to come to Alabama, to Birmingham, to tell us that the help that we’ve been looking for is here. It is going to be incumbent on all of us in this room to use those resources to the best of our ability to make sure that everyone gets through this pandemic.\\xa0\\nBackground on the American Rescue Plan District Tour:\\xa0\\nRep.

Below are Sewell’s remarks.\\xa0\\nRep. Terri Sewell: I’m Congresswoman Terri Sewell, and I am honored each and every day to represent Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. I want to thank Stuart, I want to thank the workers from Amazon, and all of the organizers from RWDSU for the courage to stand with Alabama workers.\\xa0\\nThe world is watching Alabama, and I want you to know that these workers are following a rich tradition—a tradition of civil rights and human rights of crusading against something that is wrong. This weekend, we celebrate the 56th Anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. I know that Alabama workers, like Kevin, Jennifer, and Darryl, all of these Amazon workers, stand in the same tradition as John Lewis, as Amelia Boynton Robinson, as those Foot Soldiers that dared to change the world by having the audacity to stand up for their rights.\\xa0\\nI am welcomed today by a delegation from Congress who are standing with these workers, and we have one message. Our message is: We see you! We hear you, Alabama workers! And we are with you! We are with you!\\nI just want all of you to know that it is a basic human right, the right to organize, and it is in my DNA. I am the daughter of educators, and if it wasn’t for the Alabama Education Association, AEA, my mother and my father would not have been able to integrate public schools in Alabama in order to be teachers, in order to be coaches, in order to be guidance counselors.\\nIt is important that the people of Alabama know that workers have rights. It is because of unions that we have a five day work week. It is because of unions that we have safer conditions in our places of work. It is because of unions that we have benefits.\\xa0\\nAnd so, all we ask is that, free of intimidation, the people of Alabama, Amazon workers, have the right to choose whether or not they organize—free of intimidation, free of interference. That is what we want.\\xa0\\nI want to thank my colleagues for joining me, and today I’m with four of them: Congressman Andy Levin from Michigan; Congressman Jamaal Bowman from New York; Congresswoman Nikema Williams from Georgia; and Congresswoman Cori Bush from Missouri.\\xa0\\nWe proudly stand with Alabama workers in Bessemer, Alabama because we know, we know, that standing up for the right of people to organize and collectively bargain is a God-given right for anyone who is working in America. And we look forward to going back to Congress and passing the PRO Act, which would streamline the NLRB, and stop companies from intimidating their workers.\\xa0\\nIt’s critically important that you all know that we all stand on the shoulders of John Lewis, who said if you see something that ain’t right, that’s not just, we have a moral obligation to do something about it.\\nSo, we stand in solidarity with the workers. It’s critically important that you all know that we don’t stand alone. The world is watching Alabama once again. And, once again, my district, Birmingham and Bessemer, it is so important that the world knows that once again, Alabama is standing up for civil rights, and for human rights.\\nVideo of Rep.

This bill reflects current negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, as well as needs that have risen since the original Heroes Act passed the House of Representatives in May 2020.\\n“It is unfortunate that the White House and Senate Republicans have not been willing to compromise to provide additional money for ongoing relief to our communities, workers, and families,” Sewell said. “With passage of the Updated Heroes Act today, House Democrats’ have given the White House and Senate Republicans one more chance to pass another stimulus bill that will continue to provide critical relief for the American people.”\\xa0\\n“The provisions in the Updated Heroes Act are essential to avert greater economic and health catastrophe for families, schools, small businesses, essential workers, and health care providers in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District,” Sewell continued. “Not only does this legislation deliver much-needed resources to Alabama counties and cities, it also reflects House Democrats’ willingness to compromise in good faith to ensure our country can weather this ongoing crisis.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Updated Heroes Act would provide counties and cities in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District with $396 million in funding to cover coronavirus-related outlays and revenue loss and pay our health care workers, library staff, law enforcement, fire, transportation, EMS, teachers and other vital workers who keep us safe and are in danger of losing their jobs. A town-by-town breakdown of the estimated funding allocations for the 7th District under the Updated Heroes Act is available here.\\nIn addition to resources for our state, local, tribal and territorial governments, the Updated Heroes Act maintains key priorities from the original version of the legislation that passed the House in May. The bill also provides families with a second round of direct payments of $1,200 for each individual and $500 for each dependent, and extends weekly $600 federal unemployment payments through January 2021.\\xa0\\nAmong the bill’s many provisions, it:\\n\\n\\nProvides strong support for small businesses by improving the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to serve the smallest businesses and struggling non-profits, providing hard-hit businesses with second loans, and delivering targeted assistance for the struggling restaurant industry and independent live venue operators.\\n\\n\\nMore funds to bolster education and child care, with $225 billion for education – including $182 billion for K12 schools and nearly $39 billion for postsecondary education – and $57 billion to support child care for families.\\n\\n\\nSupports testing, tracing and treatment, through $75 billion for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and isolation measures, with special attention to the disparities facing communities of color, ensuring every American can access free coronavirus treatment, and supporting hospitals and providers. The updated bill also includes $28 billion for procurement, distribution and education campaigns for a safe and effective vaccine.\\n\\n\\nProtects payrolls, by enhancing the new employee retention tax credit that encourages employers to keep employees on payroll.\\n\\n\\nPreserves health coverage, protecting Americans losing their employer-provided health insurance by making unemployed Americans automatically receive the maximum ACA subsidy on the exchanges, as well as a special enrollment period in the ACA exchanges for uninsured Americans.\\n\\n\\nStrengthens food security, addressing rising hunger with a 15 percent increase to the maximum SNAP benefit and additional funding for nutrition programs that help families put food on the table as well as targeted support for farmers and producers impacted by the crisis.\\n\\n\\nSafeguards our democracy, with new resources to ensure safe elections, an accurate Census, and preserve the Postal Service.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n###',\n",

       "  'date': 'September 21, 2020',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) applauded the passage of H.R. 991, a bipartisan bill, she introduced to reauthorize the U.S. Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) until September 2030. The legislation passed the House by unanimous voice vote.\\n\\xa0\\nThe CBTPA is a preferential trade agreement that provides for duty and quota-free access for apparel products manufactured in designated beneficiary Caribbean Basin region countries. CBTPA also requires that Caribbean Basin countries use U.S. formed yarns, fabrics, and thread. The CBTPA was first enacted in 2000 and is currently authorized through September 30, 2020. Eligible CBTPA countries include Barbados, Belize, Curacao, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago.\\n\\xa0\\n“As the lead sponsor of the legislation to reauthorize the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, I am thrilled that Congress is taking action on this issue before the program expires at the end of the month,\" said Rep. Sewell. \"CBTPA is such an important economic tool for the United States and each of our partner countries, and it is critical to our continued diplomatic relationships in the Caribbean Basin. The bipartisan effort to reauthorize this program will allow us to export more American-made goods and strengthen Western supply chains, while contributing to economic development and job creation in Haiti and other countries throughout the Caribbean Basin region. I am grateful for its passage by unanimous voice vote in the House, and I urge the Senate to take up this bill before the September 30th deadline. ”\\n\\xa0\\n\"I am incredibly grateful for Congresswoman Sewell\\'s commitment to economic prosperity in the Republic of Haiti and the Caribbean region. The Extension of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA), H.R. 991, which has received bipartisan and bicameral support, is a testament to Congress\\' unwavering support for working families in Haiti and CARICOM countries. This legislation has created countless jobs and generated billions of dollars in revenue over the past decade,” said Ambassador Herve Denis.\\n\\xa0\\n\"Furthermore, CBTPA would play a crucial role in strengthening the supply chains for PPEs and textiles in response to COVID-19, making America less dependent on nations outside the Western Hemisphere. With the issues regarding China, Haiti hopes and expects to benefit from the \"Near-Shoring\" concept introduced by Congress. Together, we can continue to strengthen bilateral trade relations between two of the oldest republics in the Americas.\"\\n\\xa0\\n“I’m proud to support our nation’s trade preference programs, which bolster further economic expansion in developing nations and support jobs here in America – a true win-win scenario,” said Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), Republican lead co-sponsor. “In particular, our bipartisan bill to extend the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act accomplishes that goal in the Caribbean, providing trade benefits to eight Caribbean nations, most notably Haiti. I want to thank Congresswoman Terri Sewell for partnering with me on this important legislation and urge the Senate to consider it without delay.”\\n\\xa0\\nTogether, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) and the CBTPA are collectively known as the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). These two acts work together to facilitate the development of 17 independent countries of the Caribbean Basin region. For these two preferential trade programs to be effective, both CBTPA and CBERA must be authorized. Eligible CBERA countries include Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the British Virgin Islands, Curacao, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n###',\n",

She met with TSA employees at both the Montgomery Regional and Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airports who have been working without pay for nearly a month as a result of the Trump government shutdown. Sewell provided the TSA officers with breakfast and lunch to thank them for their hard work despite the difficult circumstances.\\nLate Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced the Senate will vote on House-passed legislation on Thursday, marking the first votes the Republican-controlled Senate will take to re-open the government.\\n##\\nRep.

       "  'text': 'Our Federal Workers are not political pawns, Mr. President.\\nBy Rep. Terri A. Sewell\\xa0\\nIn the\\xa0Selma Times-Journal\\nAmericans deserve a well-functioning Congress that works on their behalf. I know my constituents in Alabama’s 7th District did not send me to Washington to be a party to the problem, but to seek solutions. That is why I am working every day to reopen government and allow hardworking federal employees to work and ensure government services continue uninterrupted.\\nI voted to re-open the government and fund border security the moment Congress went into session on Jan. 3. Since then, I have voted an additional eight times to ensure our federal workers receive their due pay government gets back to work.\\nTo be clear, I support investing in our nation’s border security. Just last summer, I voted for $1.6 billion to enhance our existing border security infrastructure and supported a bipartisan proposal to implement smart measures to ensure our Customs and Border Protection agents have the resources needed to effectively police the southern border. In July 2018, I went to the Texas border, toured detention centers and a port of entry, and met with border patrol agents there.\\xa0\\xa0\\nDemocrats and Republicans agree: we need to invest in our strategic infrastructure – state-of-the-art technologies to detect tunnels; sensors and radars to spot moving people and objects; and drones equipped with the technology to surveil areas that otherwise would be difficult to monitor. Equally as important, we need to provide adequate resources to combat the entry of terrorists and criminals into our country through our airports and other borders.\\nSo, when the President says that Democrats are against securing our southern border, he is being dishonest. However, real border security will not come in the form of a medieval brick-and-mortar wall.\\n\\tWhat Republicans and the President do not seem to understand is that the irresponsible Trump shutdown is impacting the wellbeing of over 800,000 federal workers and their families who depend on a steady paycheck, and countless others who depend on essential government services affected by the shutdown.\\nFor example, the Federal Bureau of Prisons is the largest employer in Pickens County, AL, which is located in my district. Those federal corrections officers are worried about being able to pay their monthly expenses, like their mortgages and essential health care costs. We also have countless other federal agencies impacted by the shutdown, including TSA, which impacts hardworking men and women in our airports, like agents in our Birmingham and Montgomery airports.\\nThe negative side effects go on. The shutdown is having a rippling effect on local businesses all over the country, including those in the urban and rural parts of our district that depend on federal workers to keep their businesses open. Additionally, over 800,000 Alabamians rely on SNAP benefits to feed their families. If the shutdown continues, too many will be left without the support they need to put food on the table.\\nWhile it’s difficult for President Trump to understand why the average American can’t go without pay, the reality in Alabama is that many of my constituents live paycheck-to-paycheck regardless of how hard they work. Many are one financial emergency away from financial ruin. It is irresponsible that this Trump shutdown, now the longest in history, was completely avoidable.\\n\\tThe status quo is unacceptable. Federal workers are not political pawns.\\nI will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find a real path forward, but we need a willing partner in the White House who appreciates the hardship he is causing everyday Americans.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\tIt’s time for President Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell to put politics aside and take up the House-passed bills to end the shutdown NOW! Our communities and workers deserve better. Our nation deserves better.\\xa0\\nU.S. Rep. Terri A.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.– On Friday, November 16, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a $23.4 million grant to address an ongoing wastewater treatment crisis in Uniontown, Alabama. USDA will work with the municipality to create an outside board which will oversee the development of a new wastewater system for Uniontown residents. Earlier this year, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) helped secure an increase of $1.8 billion in an omnibus funding bill for USDA water and wastewater infrastructure projects.\\n“Today’s grant announcement is a huge victory for Uniontown that will have a real-life impact for thousands of Alabamians living in the rural Black Belt,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “Thank you to Senators Richard Shelby and Doug Jones, Congressman Robert Aderholt, USDA State Rural Development Director Chris Beeker, and all of the state and local stakeholders who helped to make this investment possible. No American family should have to live without access to safe wastewater treatment in the 21st Century.\\xa0 I have met with families in rural Alabama who struggle with the health and economic challenges created by failing wastewater systems. Every day, their stories inspire my fight in Congress for stronger investments in our wastewater infrastructure. USDA’s assistance in Uniontown is an important step forward, but the wastewater crisis facing Alabama’s rural Black Belt is not over. We must continue fighting for Uniontown, Lowndes County, and all of our state’s residents who have to live with inadequate basic resources.”\\nFor over a decade, failing wastewater infrastructure has created enormous health and economic challenges for communities in rural Alabama. Since 2016, the issue has received national and international attention, with the release of a United Nations-sponsored report this year highlighting the failure of wastewater infrastructure in Alabama’s rural Black Belt.\\nIn March, Rep. Sewell worked with House appropriators to secure $1.8 billion in additional funding for water and wastewater infrastructure under USDA as part of an omnibus spending bill. Rep. Sewell has also toured the spray fields in Uniontown and homes in Lowndes County to survey failing and inadequate wastewater systems. In May, the Congresswoman held a health fair in Hayneville, AL with Sen. Jones to raise public awareness about the health consequences associated with failing septic systems and wastewater contamination.\\nRep. Sewell has made the repair of wastewater infrastructure a top priority since she was first elected to Congress. In 2013, Rep. Sewell helped White Hall in Lowndes County secure a $1 million grant and $112K loan through the Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program (USDA) which was used to connect 50 homes and businesses to the municipal sewer lines.\\n###\\nRep.

Sewell (D-AL) and Congressman Darin LaHood (R-IL) introduced H.R. 6486, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to exclude certain post-graduation scholarship grants from being treated as gross income and, in turn, help recruit professionals into the workforce, help alleviate student loan debt, and promote economic growth in communities. This legislation would create parity for student loan payments with how scholarship payments made by foundations are currently treated under the tax code.\\n“Today’s bill takes a smart approach to building a skilled workforce in underserved communities while at the same time tackling our nation’s student debt crisis,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “By providing tax relief to recipients of post-graduation scholarships, our bipartisan legislation supports programs which recruit skilled graduates to work in struggling communities where they are needed most. For our rural hospitals, which struggle so often to recruit medical professionals, programs like these are a critical pipeline of talent. I am proud to have worked with my Republican colleague Rep. Darin LaHood to introduce today’s bill, and I look forward to continuing our fight to strengthen America’s workforce and invest in rural and underserved communities.”\\n“This bipartisan legislation will not only help recruit talent to often underserved areas and professions, relieve individuals of student loan debt, and help foster economic development to particular regions, but charitable organizations will be provided greater flexible to serve their unique communities,” stated Rep. Darin LaHood. “With this amendment to the tax code, foundations and charitable organizations across the 18th District will be able to attract greater talent and reward professionals for committing to their local communities. I want to thank my Democratic colleague Rep. Sewell for co-authoring this bi-partisan legislation with me and I look forward to working together to get this legislation passed.”\\nA post-graduation scholarship is a type of charitable grant that foundations would make to attract individuals with career skills needed in a region to build their careers in that community.

Sewell (D-AL) is the lead Democratic co-sponsor and Congressman Andy Barr (R-KY) is the lead Republican sponsor on the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act.\\n“Passage of today’s bill means working families will be one step closer to affordable housing,” said Rep. Sewell. “In Alabama, over 300,000 families rely on manufactured homes for quality, independent, affordable housing, but current rules make access to credit for purchasing manufactured homes more difficult. The Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act ensures that manufactured housing remains an affordable option by bringing needed reform to federal mortgage regulations while preserving consumer protections that prevent predatory lending.”\\nThe Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act would ensure that manufactured home loans are not unfairly categorized as high-cost loans. This inappropriate categorization restricts the availability of credit for the purchase of manufactured homes, eliminating an option for affordable housing for working families.\\n\\xa0The Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act does not alter protections against predatory lending. It leaves in place considerable consumer protections including the Truth in Lending Act’s “Ability to Repay” requirement, the prohibition against steering a consumer to a loan that has “predatory characteristics,” loan term disclosures, the prohibition on mandatory arbitration, as well as the authority of the CFPB to prosecute unfair, deceptive abusive acts and practices.\\n###\\nRep.

Sewell (D-AL) offered three historically bipartisan amendments. All Democratic amendments, including the three offered by Rep. Sewell, were rejected without a single Republican vote. The tax bill passed the Committee by a 24-16 vote, without any bipartisan changes allowed by Republicans.\\n“I’m disappointed that all Democratic amendments, even the most modest, bipartisan changes that I offered to help ordinary, middle-class Americans, were reflexively opposed by Republicans,” said Rep. Sewell. “Republicans have thrown away an opportunity for bipartisan work on tax reform, and chose instead to pass a bill that provides tax breaks for powerful special interests at the expense of working Americans, small businesses, and local economies . In order to cut taxes for Washington special interests, the tax bill adds $2.3 trillion to the national debt and cuts popular tax deductions like the medical expense deduction, the student loan deduction, limits the mortgage interest deduction, and erases incentives that have been proven to spur local economic development.”\\n“The tax code is a reflection of our values, and this week’s Republican tax bill valued special interests and the wealthy over everyday Americans. That is why I introduced amendments to refocus the tax bill on helping working families and middle-class Americans. My amendments to promote workforce development, to equip state and local governments with the tools needed to invest in infrastructure and public works, and to save the historic preservation tax credit were commonsense solutions. I was truly disappointed to see Republicans reject our input and rush this severely flawed bill out of Committee. As this bill heads to a vote before the full House, I will continue fighting for real reform, and against cuts that will harm Alabama’s working families.”\\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Sewell offered an amendment to create a tax credit encouraging employers to invest in human capital and workforce training through apprenticeships. The amendment is modeled after the Workforce Development Tax Credit Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Rep. Sewell to reduce the skills gap and train American workers to compete in 21st Century jobs.\\nOn Wednesday, Rep. Sewell offered an amendment to restore the ability of state and local governments to save taxpayer money and increase their ability to invest in infrastructure projects by refinancing debt.\\nOn Thursday, Rep. Sewell offered an amendment to restore and expand the historic preservation tax credit, a key redevelopment tool that encourages private sector investment in rehabilitation and reuse of historic buildings. Nationwide, the historic preservation tax credit has restored over 42,000 buildings, and in Alabama the tax credit has funded 128 restoration projects since 2002.\\nThe workforce development and advanced bond refunding amendments offered by Rep.

Instead, the GOP plan cuts taxes for top earners and leaves Congress to balance the budget on the backs of the middle class.\\n“The Ryan-McConnell plan eliminates the alternative minimum tax for high-income individuals at an estimated cost of $413 billion over the next decade. The plan also recommends reducing the top tax bracket from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, a benefit helping only those tax filers earning over $470,000. Altogether, the tax giveaway proposed by Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell would increase the deficit by an estimated $2.2 trillion, leaving future generations with the bill.”\\n“Just yesterday, I met with President Trump at the White House, where the President promised that his tax plan would not be a tax cut for the wealthy. I plan on holding the President to his word. We cannot miss an opportunity for tax reform that puts working families and small businesses first.”\\nOn Tuesday, Rep.

That store was a vital part of Fairfield’s local economy, and approximately 300 employees will lose their jobs as a result. The closure also creates a food desert in Fairfield, an underserved area where residents have few viable alternatives to purchase quality and affordable food.\\n“Creating jobs continues to be my top priority. The economy has turned back from the brink and is growing, but the recovery is far too modest and more needs to be done to address persistent unemployment. Closing this Walmart store will be a step in the wrong direction. Despite remarkable economic gains I believe that our work is not done. Too many working men and women continue to struggle just to provide the basic necessities for their families.\\n“The closing of the Walmart Supercenter in Fairfield is simply wrong for my constituents. Too many communities of color find themselves underserved and disadvantaged and closing this store will not help the situation. If we are to truly and substantively address these inequities, we must ensure that economic prosperity is a dream attainable to all who are willing to work for it. Closing this Walmart is the wrong thing to do!\\n“I have expressed my concerns to senior Walmart executives. My hope is that Walmart will reconsider this decision after analyzing the negative effect this would have on the Western Birmingham communities. Walmart is one of our nation’s largest employers, and it is critically important that they consider the impact of their decisions on the communities they serve.”\\n###',\n",

       "  'text': 'Today, Congresswoman Terri Sewell voted for the passage of the Omnibus Appropriations bill:\\n“After a thoughtful and thorough review, I have decided to vote in favor of the Omnibus Appropriations bill. I have reservations about several provisions in the bill, but ultimately I believe that the good contained in this bill outweighs the bad. My vote was cast in favor of keeping the government operating and to continue to make critical investments agency programs that benefit all Americans. I also firmly believe that we cannot afford another shutdown and this bill provides the Federal Government with funding through September 30, 2016.\\n“The omnibus provides much needed increases for a broad range of education programs including Head Start, Title I grants, aid to HBCUs, the TRIO and GEAR UP programs, and rural education. Providing the resources low-income families need to increase their academic success is one of my highest priorities, and this legislation is a first step in the right direction.\\xa0\\n“Furthermore, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and other minority serving institutions are set to receive an additional $40 million in funding. HBCUs have created and fostered a generation of African-American professionals, and still play a vital role in educating our youth. My district is home to some of the most prominent HBCUs in the Country, and as a Vice Chair of the Bipartisan Congressional HBCU Caucus, securing adequate funding for these institutions is critically important to me.\\n“I am also pleased that this bill provides funding through the Department of the Interior that will be used to preserve historic civil sites. The struggle for civil and voting rights is an integral part of American history. Our district is known as the civil rights district, and we have the potential to benefit from this competitive grant process. I fought to secure two amendments that made this funding possible in order to preserve important civil rights sites for future generations.\\n“The bill includes many increases in programs that are critical to improving access to quality health care and innovative medical research. I am particularly pleased to see a much needed increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). These investments in research are essential to providing long-term stability for our research communities in Birmingham and across the state. The package recognizes that HIV and Hepatitis should be a priority by reinvesting in the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As the mental health crisis becomes more urgent, the deal’s increased funding for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency (SAMHSA) is a welcome sign of progress for the mental health community.\\n“There is an urgent need to address racial health disparities in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District, and I am pleased this bill recognizes that need. By funding Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH), Congress has made an investment to help eliminate health disparities across a range of diseases, including: heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.\\xa0\\n“This is not a perfect bill, but I am proud that both sides of the aisle were able to work out a compromise that benefits our nation, and helps us continue to grow.”\\n###',\n",

This legislation includes several provisions that I strongly support like the earned income tax credit, the child tax credit, and the American opportunity tax credit. The package also provides a two-year moratorium on the medical device tax and extends the work opportunity tax credit to help employers that hire Americans who have faced significant barriers to employment.\\nHowever, I am deeply concerned that passing this tax extenders package without offsetting its cost would greatly undermine our ability to make key discretionary investments in the future, hurt job creation, and lessen opportunities that make the American dream possible for millions of families across our great nation.\\xa0 The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that the overall provisions contained within this bill would reduce net revenues, and increase deficits by a total of $622 billion over 10 years. We know that every dollar in lost revenue must be made up somewhere else in the budget. Far too often my Republican colleagues have sought to do this by reducing spending in critically important domestic spending programs such as infrastructure, education, social security, and healthcare.\\n“I carefully weighed this tax extenders package against its long-term impact on Congress’ ability to help businesses create jobs and opportunities, invest in our aging infrastructure, and strengthen our national security. In the end, this bill came up short.\\n“The American people deserve a more balanced bill that offsets its cost, and helps both individuals and businesses equitably across the board.

If Congress refused to act, premiums for Alabama’s Medicare population would have jumped 52 percent on January 1, 2016.

We cannot afford to lose even one job because other countries are not playing by the rules.\\n“One-sided trade practices like dumping and currency manipulation are hurting American businesses, particularly our steel industry, and the U.S. trade remedy laws only correct the problem after the fact. By the time that the process has been completed, American workers have already been laid off and our businesses have already lost their market share.\\n“American industries should not be forced to compete on an uneven playing field. Unfair trade practices hurt our domestic economy and our competitiveness abroad.”\\n###',\n",

A video of her speech is available online at https://sewell.house.gov/media-center/videos. Below is the text of her floor speech:\\nThank you Mr./Madam Speaker,\\nToday I rise to talk about the critical need for stronger oversight of payday lenders.\\nIn March, I welcomed President Obama to the City of Birmingham in my district, where he highlighted our nation’s economic recovery and put a spotlight on the area that needed most improvement. The President highlighted the urgent need for better regulation of the payday lending industry the very same day that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau unveiled proposals to rein in this loosely-regulated industry.\\nI hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the CFPB’s efforts to ensure that these products help -- not harm -- consumers. The payday lending and title loan industry must take steps to ensure that borrowers understand the loan terms and have the resources to pay them back.\\xa0\\nIn my district, the proliferation of payday lending is really unacceptable. On every corner, you will find a payday lender. In fact the President quoted that there were more payday lending institutions in my district than there were McDonald’s.\\nThese borrowers are disproportionately African American or Latino – two communities that were severely impacted by the predatory lending practices – and far too many of these borrowers find themselves trapped in a cycle of debt.\\nIn the coming weeks, I plan to introduce a bill and to spearhead efforts led by consumer industry groups to protect consumers from predatory lending. I ask my colleagues to join me. These good people are my constituents, and not this industry’s prey.\\n###',\n",

The President is expected to discuss the economy, payday lending and the success of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):\\n“President Obama is a staunch advocate for a strong financial system that provides greater transparency and accountability for all Americans. Under his administration the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has helped consumers recover more than $5.3 billion by ending unfair and abusive practices.\\xa0\\n“I hosted CFPB Director Richard Cordray in Birmingham for their first Field Hearing on Payday Lending. While I understand there is a real need for emergency credit, I strongly believe consumer protections are needed to regulate this industry.\\n“The President’s visit to the City brings the national spotlight to the State of Alabama, a state with one of the highest concentrations of payday lenders. Thus, it is fitting that President Obama will travel to Birmingham to speak about the progress we have made to build a safer and stronger financial system that protects families from the abuses which led the economy to near collapse—and his commitment to safeguarding that progress.\\xa0\\n“America has a lot of work to do to improve our economy.\\xa0 The City of Birmingham and the State of Alabama have the tools and the leadership needed to create solid job growth and make the economic recovery a reality for those struggling families who have yet to feel its full effects.\\n“As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, I will continue to work with my colleagues to promote better financial practices that protect consumers, strengthen our economy and stimulate economic growth.\\n“I welcome President Obama to Birmingham for his second visit to Alabama this month.

Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other conditions that harm students’ health and cause them to miss school, particularly in communities of color and Tribal communities. Phasing out these diesel engines will ensure cleaner air for students, bus drivers, and school staff working near the bus loading areas, and the communities through which the buses drive each day.\\nThe reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from these bus replacements will also help to address the outsized role of the transportation sector in fueling the climate crisis.

       "  'title': 'Rep. Sewell Votes for President Biden’s Historic Build Back Better Act',\n",
       "  'date': 'November 18, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass President Biden’s historic Build Back Better Act, once-in-a-generation legislation to lower costs for hard-working Alabamians, cut taxes for families and workers, and build an economy that puts working families first. Notably, it will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 per year. Among its many provisions, the bill would close the Medicaid coverage gap, create good-paying jobs, lower child care and health care costs, create universal pre-K, establish paid family and medical leave, reduce housing costs, and make the largest investment in combating the climate crisis in American history. The bill passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 220-213 and will now make its way to the U.S. Senate.\\n“Within six weeks of President Biden taking office, we passed the American Rescue Plan to save our economy, crush the pandemic, and deliver critical relief to Americans everywhere,” said Rep. Sewell. “Just last week, we delivered the largest investment in our nation’s infrastructure in nearly a century. Now, with the passage of President Biden’s historic Build Back Better Act, House Democrats are delivering on our promise to build an economy that puts working families first!”\\n“For far too long, those at the very top have seen their fortunes grow while hard-working Americans have been squeezed,” continued Sewell. “Not anymore—I’m proud to report that the Build Back Better Act will uplift Alabama’s most underserved communities with transformational progress! The bill will provide affordable health insurance to Alabamians caught in the coverage gap, lower prescription drug costs, create universal pre-K, extend the Child Tax Credit, address the climate crisis and environmental injustice with bold action, and so much more. Together, President Biden and Congressional Democrats will continue to deliver historic progress for the American people!”\\nThe Build Back Better Act:\\nCreates Millions of Good-Paying Jobs - Together with the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Build Back Better Act will create an average of 2 million jobs per year over the course of the next decade.\\nCuts Taxes for Families and Workers - Prior to the pandemic, 16% of children under the age of 18 in Alabama lived in poverty. The Build Back Better Act will bolster financial security and spur economic growth in Alabama by reducing taxes on the middle class and those striving to break into it. The bill will extend Child Tax Credit (CTC) increases of $300/month per child under 6 or $250/month per child ages 6 to 17. This will continue the largest one-year reduction in child poverty in history. Critically, the agreement includes permanent refundability for the Child Tax Credit, meaning that the neediest families will continue to receive the full Child Tax Credit over the long-run. The bill will also provide a tax cut of up to $1,500 for 274,300 low-wage workers in Alabama by extending the American Rescue Plan’s Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) expansion.\\nCloses the Medicaid Coverage Gap and Provides the Largest Expansion of Affordable Health Care in a Decade - Because states like Alabama refuse to expand Medicaid, about 4 million Americans and nearly 300,000 Alabamians lack health insurance. The Build Back Better Act will close the Medicaid coverage gap by extending through 2025 the enhanced premium subsidies in the ACA Marketplace that were included in the American Rescue Plan. In doing so, it will ensure that every Alabamian and every American in the Medicaid coverage gap has access to affordable health insurance.\\nExpands Medicare with Hearing Coverage for Seniors - Beginning January 1, 2023, the bill allows for qualified audiologists to deliver aural rehabilitation and treatment services under Medicare, in addition to the hearing and balance assessment services provided under current law. It also allows for qualified hearing aid professionals to deliver hearing assessment services under Medicare. The bill also provides for coverage of hearing aids under Medicare Part B forindividuals with moderately severe, severe or profound loss in one or both ears.\\nLowers Prescription Drug Costs - The Build Back Better Act allows the Secretary of HHS to negotiate certain drug prices and halts price hikes above inflation for all Americans. It ensures that Americans with diabetes don’t pay more than $35 per month for their insulin. It also creates a new, out-of-pocket cap of $2,000 on what seniors pay for their drugs in Medicare Part D.\\nLowers Child Care Costs - Working families across Alabama are facing a child care crisis. The high cost of child care is straining family budgets and pushing millions of Alabamians out of the workforce – a majority of whom are women. The lack of affordable child care is also hurting our economy. As workers are forced to stay home, employers are struggling to fill job openings to meet demand and grow their businesses. The Build Back Better Act will dramatically lower the cost of child care for many families. Under the bill, the vast majority of families would not pay more than seven percent of their income on child care, representing an enormous savings from what they pay now. The bill invests a total $390 billion for the child care initiative and the universal preschool initiative. Under the bill, child care providers would also have resources to raise wages for child care workers and expand available supply to serve more children and families.\\nEstablishes Paid Family and Medical Leave - The United States lags behind the rest of the industrialized world when it comes to guaranteeing paid family and medical leave. Only 21 percent of American workers have access to employer-provided paid family leave, and just 42 percent of American workers have access to paid medical leave through an employer-provided plan. The Build Back Better Act establishes a universal and permanent family and medical leave program. The program provides four weeks of paid parental, family caregiving, and medical leave.\\nProvides Universal, High-Quality, Free Pre-K for Every 3- and 4-year old in America - Today, only 23% of 3- and 4-year-olds in Alabama have access to publicly funded preschool, and it costs about $8,600 per year for those who can’t access a publicly-funded program. The Build Back Better Act will enable Alabama to expand access to free, high-quality preschool to more than about 105,000 additional 3- and 4-year-olds per year and increase the quality of preschool for children who are already enrolled. Parents will be able to send their children to the preschool setting of their choice—from public schools to child care providers to Head Start—leading to lifelong educational benefits, allowing more parents to go back to work, and building a stronger foundation for Alabama’s future economic competitiveness.\\nInvests in HBCUs, TCUs and MSIs - The Build Back Better Act invests $3 billion in a competitive grant program to improve the research capacity and research and development infrastructure at four-year Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). The competitive grant program will consist of planning grants for a period of one to two years and implementation grants for a period of one to five years. The bill also invests $6 billion in institutional aid grants to HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, which can be used by these institutions to strengthen their academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities and award need-based financial aid to low-income students.\\nReduces Housing Costs and Expands Housing Options - 260,000 renters in Alabama are rent burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent, while homeownership remains out of reach for many families. The Build Back Better Act will expand rental assistance for Alabama renters, while also increasing the supply of high-quality housing through the construction and rehabilitation of over 1 million affordable housing units nationwide. It will address the capital needs of the entire public housing stock in America and it includes one of the largest investments in down payment assistance in history, enabling more first-generation homebuyers to purchase their first home.\\nMakes the Largest Effort to Combat Climate Change in American History - From 2010 to 2020, Alabama experienced 38 extreme weather events, costing up to $20 billion in damages. The Build Back Better Act is the largest effort to combat climate change in American history, investing $555 billion over 10 years in clean energy and climate investments. It contains green tax credits which will save the average American family hundreds of dollars per year in energy costs. It also Ensures clean energy technology – from wind turbine blades to solar panels to electric cars – will be built in the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of good jobs here at home.\\nFor a comprehensive breakdown of the Build Back Better Act, click here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C.\\xa0– Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that she secured the inclusion of over $7.8 million for eight community projects in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District in House Democrats’ FY2022 government funding bills. With the passage of these bills in the House of Representatives this week, funding for these community projects has cleared a key hurdle. The bills must now face negotiations in the Senate.\\n“I fought hard to secure funding for community projects in Alabama’s 7th District in the 2022 government funding bills, and I am beyond thrilled to announce that over $7.8 million was included for projects in our district,” said Rep. Sewell. “By including funding for these projects, House Democrats are bypassing bureaucracy and getting money directly into the community where it’s needed. I am hopeful that the Senate will swiftly approve this funding and I look forward to seeing President Biden sign it into law.”\\nIn April, Rep. Sewell submitted requests to the House Appropriations Committee to fund\\xa0community projects\\xa0in Alabama’s 7th District. Funding for eight of these projects, totaling\\xa0$7,829,355, was included in House Democrats’ appropriations package that passed in the House this week. The bills will now make their way to the Senate where they will face additional negotiations before being passed and signed into law by President Biden. Rep. Sewell looks forward to her other community project funding requests being included in Appropriations bills still pending before the House of Representatives.\\nRep. Sewell secured funding, totaling $7,829,355.00, for the following community projects in the House’s government funding bills:\\n*NOTE: Funding for these projects must still be passed by the Senate.\\n\\nJefferson County - Greater Shiloh Baptist Church - Employment and Training Project\\n\\nRecipient: Cornerstone Revitalization Foundation, Inc.\\nAward: $1,500,000.00\\nProject: To reduce recidivism, CWD will afford adults ages 25 and older opportunities to learn trade and technical skills. Participants will also have the opportunity to get their GED and pursue post-secondary education opportunities and help with obtaining affordable housing. The program is about assisting participants with not just jobs but careers.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nJefferson County - North Birmingham Community Development Rehabilitation Project\\n\\nRecipient: City of Birmingham\\nAward: $3,000,000.00\\nProject: The North Birmingham Community has suffered from environmental justice concerns for over a century. A largely redlined area, the community includes multiple coal refinement operations, the 35th Avenue Superfund site, and parts of the community sustain flood damage regularly. This project would remove environmental concerns in the old North Birmingham Elementary School.\\xa0The redevelopment of the North Birmingham site would provide a transformative redevelopment investment in North Birmingham.\\n\\n\\nJefferson County - Small Business Accelerator Program\\n\\nRecipient: Central Alabama Redevelopment Alliance\\nAward: $474,355.00\\nProject: The Small Business Accelerator provides micro companies and small businesses access to instructional workshops, key resource providers, and other support to help them expand and create jobs for the local community.\\xa0The Accelerator helps Alabama small businesses establish core systems and processes that would allow their business to survive a natural disaster, economic downturn, or other business interruptions.\\n\\n\\nLowndes County - Wastewater Disposal Treatment System Project\\n\\nRecipient: Lowndes County Unincorporated Wastewater Program\\nAward: $700,000.00\\nProject: Failing septic tanks and deteriorating wastewater infrastructure in Lowndes County have left many families with untreated sewage in their yards and in local waterways.\\xa0This is not only an infrastructure crisis, but a healthcare crisis. This funding would facilitate the installation of septic tanks for homes in unincorporated areas without proper wastewater disposal systems.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nPerry County – Drinking Water Infrastructure Project\\n\\nRecipient: City of Marion\\nAward: $480,000.00\\nProject: The improvement of the City of Marion’s water infrastructure is critical to the health and economic vitality of the community. Failures of the water system after recent natural disasters have threatened the continued operation of local institutions like Marion Military Institute and Judson College. These funds will help provide functional water systems to a community that is combating intergenerational poverty in the Black Belt.\\n\\n\\nSumter County - Hill Hospital Construction Project\\n\\nRecipient: Hill Hospital\\nAward: $575,000.00\\nProject: For several years, Hill Hospital has faced persistent challenges to provide comprehensive health care to the citizens in Sumter County. Geographic isolation, economic fluctuations, and the COVID 19 pandemic have magnified these challenges. This funding will improve the facilities and patient rooms at Hill Hospital so they can continue to serve the county and provide healthcare to the rural community. The long-term viability of Hill Hospital will prevent residents from traveling to other counties and states to seek health care.\\n\\n\\nTuscaloosa County - Community Health Worker Initiative\\n\\nRecipient: West Central Alabama Area Health Education Center\\nAward: $300,000.00\\nProject: The Community Health Worker Initiative will develop and implement a training program throughout Alabama to improve access to healthcare, increase community resilience, and promote health education in rural areas.\\xa0Nearly half of Alabama’s state population lives in a rural county, and on average, those individuals are more likely to be low-income, uninsured, and suffer from higher rates of chronic health conditions.\\xa0This program will help aid these communities while also addressing the primary care, dental, and mental health workforce shortage in Alabama.\\n\\n\\nTuscaloosa County -\\xa0TRAMS CORE Improvement of Postsecondary Education\\n\\nRecipient: Stillman College\\nAward: $800,000.00\\nProject: The Translational and Mechanistic Science for Collaborative Organic Research Environment (TRAMS CORE) program addresses traditional roadblocks for research and will provide a platform to generate new research efforts on the campus of a HBCU. Subsequently, the successful integration of shared resources will support continued growth in biomedical research in the community. This proposal is part of a long-term commitment toward the development and sustainability of biomedical research facilities at Stillman College.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced over $7 million in federal funding for Head Start programs serving Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. This funding will allow Head Start programs to continue preparing Alabama children for success and will grow our economy by helping caregivers get back to work knowing their children are safe and cared for.\\n“Our children are our future and our greatest asset,” said Rep. Sewell. “Tragically, the COVID-19 pandemic deprived too many Alabama children of a safe, supportive learning environment, causing them to fall behind in their educational journeys.”\\n“The best way to put our country on a path to prosperity is by investing in the next generation of change-makers,” continued Sewell. “I’m so proud to announce that Head Start programs serving children in Alabama’s 7th District will receive over $7 million from the American Rescue Plan. This funding will help us bounce back from the devastation of the past year by getting parents back to work and providing our children the tools they need to grow and thrive.”\\nFunding, which totals $7,170,627 was awarded to the following Head Start programs serving Alabama’s 7th Congressional District.\\nHead Start programs serving only Alabama’s 7th District:\\n\\nPickens County Community Action Committee and Community Development Corporation, Inc. - $271,606\\nSumter County Opportunity, Inc. -\\xa0 $579,106\\nLowndes Co.

Sewell helped secure through the American Rescue Plan (previously announced) to keep Alabama’s child care providers on the job and keep costs down for working families.\\nThe American Rescue Plan also includes a historic increase in support for child care through the tax code, helping millions of working families afford needed care. Rep. Sewell played a critical role in drafting the expansions of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan, which are projected to cut child poverty in the United States in half. More information on the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit can be found here.\\nHow local Head Start programs are using funding from the American Rescue Plan\\n“The 2020 school year was very challenging,” said Cynthia Simpson, Executive Director of Pickens County Community Action. “We, like many other schools, elected to offer virtual learning to protect our staff and most importantly, our little people. We understand the burden this may have caused and the educational setback, so we are proud to offer the Pickens County Summer Learning Program for our students. The American Rescue Plans has provided the opportunity to offer summer learning to ensure our 4-year-olds are prepared for the transition to kindergarten. We were also able to purchase PPE and an additional bus to provide necessary space for support staff and students during transport to and from school.”\\n“The Blackbelt Community Foundation has been overwhelmed with requests for support from our communities,” said Felicia Lucky, President of the Blackbelt Community Foundation. “Funds made possible by the American Rescue Plan have allowed us to bridge the digital divide that was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We were able to purchase laptops to keep our children and staff safe as we all worked to decrease the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Most importantly, we have been able to extend necessary resources for the communities supported by the Blackbelt Community Foundation in Choctaw, Dallas, Marengo, and Wilcox counties. This ensures our children have the tools necessary to navigate educational requirements during these unprecedented times.”\\xa0\\n“The Lowndes County Head Start plans on using the funds from the American Rescue Plan to provide mental health support for children, families, and our staff as well as opportunities for professional development,” said Lashica Mason, Fiscal Manager for Lowndes County Head Start. “The funds will also help purchase cleaning supplies and new playground equipment.”\\nBackground on Head Start Programs\\nHead Start programs promote the school readiness of infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children from low-income families. Services are provided in a variety of settings including centers, family child care, and a child’s own home. Programs also engage parents or other key family members in positive relationships, with a focus on family wellbeing. Head Start programs provide services through 1,600 agencies in local communities and serve more than one million children per year in every state and U.S. territory. Most are run by non-profit organizations, schools, and community action agencies.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Birmingham, AL - Today, Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) welcomed First Lady of the United States Dr. Jill Biden to Birmingham to highlight the historic reduction in child poverty that will be achieved thanks to the American Rescue Plan. Rep. Sewell played a critical role in drafting the expansions of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan, which are projected to cut child poverty in the United States by more than a half.\\xa0\\nRep. Terri Sewell: Good afternoon Birmingham! What a great day to welcome Dr. Jill Biden, the First Lady of the United States, to our wonderful city of Birmingham.\\xa0\\nAs the only member of the Alabama Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of the 1.9 trillion dollar American Rescue Plan, here’s what I know for a fact: the people that I represent need assistance to get through COVID-19. I heard from them, and I know that they need money to be able to afford food on their tables and resources to make sure that they are equitably receiving the vaccine.\\xa0\\nThank God that because of the American Rescue Plan, 1.9 trillion dollars were able to put shots in arms and in record time. You know the Biden-Harris Administration said that they were going to do 100 million shots in arms by the first 100 days. We were able to do it in 58 days! We also know that we needed direct funds to our state but also to our counties and our cities. I heard you Mr. Mayor and all of our mayors across the 7th Congressional District when they said they wanted direct resources and I am proud to announce that help is here!\\nToday I am thrilled to talk about another aspect of the American Rescue Plan. We knew that it was critically important that we help families, the whole family. We knew how important it was to help our children so the second round of $600 that went out in December, as well as the $1400 that went out just 2 weeks ago, include resources not just for the adults in the family, but for the children in the family as well. Through this plan, a family of 4 would receive not just the $1,400 for mom and dad, but for their children as well. That’s $5600 for an average family of four.\\xa0\\nToday I am proud to be right here at the YWCA and I want to thank LaRhonda and all of your staff for hosting us today. We started off at the James Rushton Early Learning Center at Woodlawn and I want to thank them and the Woodlawn Foundation for allowing us to see firsthand how our children are not only learning but they are thriving even in the midst of this pandemic. And that’s what it’s about.\\xa0\\nUnder the leadership of LaRohanda and so many others, the YWCA of Central Alabama has had a profound impact on countless families and children in our region. As I said earlier today, we were at the Woodlawn Foundation’s James Rushton Early Learning Center, where we toured a classroom and met with children who are benefiting every day from this institution. For years they have dedicated themselves to revitalizing the community of Woodlawn and they are doing it. They’re not just talking about it—they are about it!\\nAlso, I am thrilled to be with Alabama Child Advocate Liz Huntley who will introduce Dr. Biden in a minute. She is among the countless local leaders that are present here today as we talk about child poverty and the fact that the American Rescue Plan deals will deal with that directly.\\xa0\\nI see my dear friend, Senator Doug Jones: You will always be my Senator! And his lovely wife, Louise, thank you.\\xa0\\nThe Biden Administration knows that the time is now to address the systemic inequities that have left so many families struggling to make it. Together with Congressional Democrats, we passed the American Rescue Plan because of our fundamental belief that good governance creates an environment that allows all of our people to reach their full potential. If we’ve learned anything during this pandemic, it’s that we cannot wait a single day to provide resources to America’s working and struggling families to try and level the playing field, especially for our children. That is why I\\'m so proud to have been the only Democrat in Alabama’s Delegation to vote in favor of the 1.9 trillion dollar American Rescue Plan.\\xa0\\nWe know that one of the greatest contributors to the opportunity gap between children in communities like the one we’re in right now and the ones in wealthy neighborhoods across the nation is the financial investment the parents are able to make in their children. Every parent I met in my district, irrespective of zip code, wanted the best for their children, but they struggle day in and day out just to make ends meet. They fall behind when it matters most and we know that we need additional resources for our public schools.\\nI am proud that we are investing in our public schools not just immediately but also acknowledging that we need remedial help as well. Our children learn best in the classroom and we all know that which is why the American Rescue Plan will be giving direct assistance to individual school systems such as Jefferson County Public Schools and the City of Birmingham Public Schools. That is hundreds of millions of dollars and that money will be earmarked to not only deal with COVID-19 relief now to get our children back into schools safely, but also to deal with the remedial learning that we know our children will need. And so I want you all to know that the American Rescue Plan is truly that: a rescue plan to deal with COVID-19 and make sure our communities not only survive this pandemic, but they thrive through it!\\nAs of 2019, 34% of the children in my district lived below the poverty line and 53% of those children, that\\'s over half of the children in America, do not receive the full benefits of the Child Tax Credit because it isn’t fully refundable. We know that our response has to be big and bold in this rescue plan.\\xa0\\nIt is important that we use every tool in the toolbox to deal with this pandemic and to provide relief. As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, our jurisdiction is taxes. It is the revenue-generating operation of the House, and we thought that it was critically important that we make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable.\\xa0\\nWhat do I mean by that? By making this Child Tax Credit fully refundable, we are reaching the neediest of families. We are not only doing that, we are also expanding it by providing direct payments in the form of a child allowance. This year families will receive $3,600 per child under the age of 6 and $3,000 per child for children between the ages of 6 and 16. These payments will be made on a recurring monthly basis with families receiving their first checks hopefully in July.\\xa0\\nThis is about saving working families and ensuring our children get out of poverty. As a lifelong educator, I know that Dr. Jill Biden has dedicated herself to transforming the lives of American children. Now, as the First Lady, she has taken the same vigor and applied it to eradicating child poverty. We know that just by making the Child Tax Credit fully refundable that we can lift 40% of the children living below the poverty line above it. The American Rescue Plan not only provides help, but it also uplifts our community and it does so for our children as well.\\xa0\\nI want to say in closing that it was Martin Luther King that said, “poverty is a state of mind but, it also is a state of existence\" and we in the greatest country in the world, should not have anyone living in poverty. We need to figure out a way that we can provide the resources so that every child can grow up and reach their fullest potential. We see that with the wonderful children here at the YWCA and we saw that at the James Rushton Early Learning Center.\\xa0\\nI am so happy that Dr. Jill Biden chose to come to Alabama, to Birmingham, to tell us that the help that we’ve been looking for is here. It is going to be incumbent on all of us in this room to use those resources to the best of our ability to make sure that everyone gets through this pandemic.\\xa0\\nBackground on the American Rescue Plan District Tour:\\xa0\\nRep.

Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted in favor of the Updated Heroes Act, House Democrats’ latest legislation to address the ongoing needs that have resulted from the COVID-19 public health crisis. This bill reflects current negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, as well as needs that have risen since the original Heroes Act passed the House of Representatives in May 2020.\\n“It is unfortunate that the White House and Senate Republicans have not been willing to compromise to provide additional money for ongoing relief to our communities, workers, and families,” Sewell said. “With passage of the Updated Heroes Act today, House Democrats’ have given the White House and Senate Republicans one more chance to pass another stimulus bill that will continue to provide critical relief for the American people.”\\xa0\\n“The provisions in the Updated Heroes Act are essential to avert greater economic and health catastrophe for families, schools, small businesses, essential workers, and health care providers in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District,” Sewell continued. “Not only does this legislation deliver much-needed resources to Alabama counties and cities, it also reflects House Democrats’ willingness to compromise in good faith to ensure our country can weather this ongoing crisis.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Updated Heroes Act would provide counties and cities in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District with $396 million in funding to cover coronavirus-related outlays and revenue loss and pay our health care workers, library staff, law enforcement, fire, transportation, EMS, teachers and other vital workers who keep us safe and are in danger of losing their jobs. A town-by-town breakdown of the estimated funding allocations for the 7th District under the Updated Heroes Act is available here.\\nIn addition to resources for our state, local, tribal and territorial governments, the Updated Heroes Act maintains key priorities from the original version of the legislation that passed the House in May. The bill also provides families with a second round of direct payments of $1,200 for each individual and $500 for each dependent, and extends weekly $600 federal unemployment payments through January 2021.\\xa0\\nAmong the bill’s many provisions, it:\\n\\n\\nProvides strong support for small businesses by improving the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to serve the smallest businesses and struggling non-profits, providing hard-hit businesses with second loans, and delivering targeted assistance for the struggling restaurant industry and independent live venue operators.\\n\\n\\nMore funds to bolster education and child care, with $225 billion for education – including $182 billion for K12 schools and nearly $39 billion for postsecondary education – and $57 billion to support child care for families.\\n\\n\\nSupports testing, tracing and treatment, through $75 billion for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and isolation measures, with special attention to the disparities facing communities of color, ensuring every American can access free coronavirus treatment, and supporting hospitals and providers. The updated bill also includes $28 billion for procurement, distribution and education campaigns for a safe and effective vaccine.\\n\\n\\nProtects payrolls, by enhancing the new employee retention tax credit that encourages employers to keep employees on payroll.\\n\\n\\nPreserves health coverage, protecting Americans losing their employer-provided health insurance by making unemployed Americans automatically receive the maximum ACA subsidy on the exchanges, as well as a special enrollment period in the ACA exchanges for uninsured Americans.\\n\\n\\nStrengthens food security, addressing rising hunger with a 15 percent increase to the maximum SNAP benefit and additional funding for nutrition programs that help families put food on the table as well as targeted support for farmers and producers impacted by the crisis.\\n\\n\\nSafeguards our democracy, with new resources to ensure safe elections, an accurate Census, and preserve the Postal Service.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n###',\n",

The Strength In Diversity Act helps fulfill the promise of equity in education by offering support to districts that are developing, implementing, or expanding school diversity initiatives, whereas The Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act takes steps to hold federally funded programs, including schools, accountable for their responsibility to provide all students with equal opportunity for a quality education.\\n“As the proud product of Alabama’s public schools and the state’s first Black Congresswoman, I am profoundly aware of the equalizing power of a good education. Segregation and discrimination in public schools robbed generations before me of academic and economic opportunity, the long-term effects of which are still evident in our most vulnerable communities,” Rep. Sewell said. “While we have seen many strides forward in the 66 years since Brown v. Board of Education, the remnants of discrimination and inequality can still be seen today in school districts across the country, including the Black Belt. No child’s education should be relegated by race or income lines in America, but it has unfortunately been the reality for generations of students. The time is now to provide the long overdue equality and justice all children deserve to grow up with. This legislation directly confronts injustice with solutions for District 7, where due to school funding policies enacted over a century ago the state is spending upwards of $5,000 less per pupil in the majority-Black Birmingham City School system than neighboring school districts with lower poverty rates.

For our rural hospitals, this legislation encourages CMS to evaluate how regional disparities in reimbursement policies contribute to the rural hospital closure crisis.

For our rural hospitals, which struggle so often to recruit medical professionals, programs like these are a critical pipeline of talent. I am proud to have worked with my Republican colleague Rep. Darin LaHood to introduce today’s bill, and I look forward to continuing our fight to strengthen America’s workforce and invest in rural and underserved communities.”\\n“This bipartisan legislation will not only help recruit talent to often underserved areas and professions, relieve individuals of student loan debt, and help foster economic development to particular regions, but charitable organizations will be provided greater flexible to serve their unique communities,” stated Rep. Darin LaHood. “With this amendment to the tax code, foundations and charitable organizations across the 18th District will be able to attract greater talent and reward professionals for committing to their local communities. I want to thank my Democratic colleague Rep. Sewell for co-authoring this bi-partisan legislation with me and I look forward to working together to get this legislation passed.”\\nA post-graduation scholarship is a type of charitable grant that foundations would make to attract individuals with career skills needed in a region to build their careers in that community. It functions much like a traditional scholarship, but would pay off a portion of student loans held by an individual who has already completed a degree or technical program.\\n\\xa0\\n###\\nRep.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Tuesday, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) introduced the Public Funds for Public Schools Act (H.R. 4269), a bill which would close a tax loophole that diverts resources away from public schools and allows the wealthy to turn a profit on donations to private school voucher organizations. Each year, wealthy donors use tuition tax credits to divert an estimated $1 billion in taxpayer funding to private and often unaccountable schools. Rep. Danny Davis (D-IL) is an original co-sponsor of the Public Funds for Public Schools Act.\\n“As the daughter of two long-time educators and the proud product of Selma public schools, I know the power of public education,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “Today’s legislation would stop wealthy donors from cheating our tax system and diverting dollars away from children in our public schools. Under current law, wealthy donors in states like Alabama can turn a profit on contributions to private school voucher organizations by claiming both state and federal tax benefits. At a time when our public schools are short on resources and Congress is struggling to find funding for important programs such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), we have a responsibility to close this tax loophole and protect public funds for public schools.”\\nTuition Tax Credits (TTCs) are offered to individuals or corporations in 18 states who contribute to Scholarship Granting Organizations or school voucher nonprofits. In seven of these states, the tax credit is dollar for dollar. In addition to receiving a full refund from their state, these wealthy donors qualify for a federal tax deduction on the same donation, allowing many donors to turn a profit off of their contribution to the private school system.\\nFor more information on the Public School Funds for Public Schools Act, see the one-pager.\\nIn addition to the lost revenue for public education, TTCs hurt public schools by encouraging the departure of well-resourced students to private schools. Thirty-five states provided less overall state funding per student in the 2014 school year than before the recession took hold in 2008. Rather than investing more in public schools, states with TTCs are reimbursing the wealthy for providing funding to private, often unaccredited schools.\\nSavings created by the Public Funds for Public Schools Act could be reinvested in the school system to offset costs for K-12 education programs, like those under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).',\n",

National HBCU week runs from Sunday, September 17 through September 23, 2017.\\nSee pictures and video from Rep.

Sewell. “For many families in my district, including my own, HBCUs are where the first member of a family went to college. Today, these schools are where the latest generation are earning their degrees. As Vice Chair of the bipartisan HBCU Caucus, I have made it a top priority to advocate for these important institutions, raise awareness for the challenges they face, and cherish these schools for the gifts they give to our communities.”\\nHBCUs make up only 3 percent of colleges and universities in America. More than 300,000 students attend HBCUs each year, 80 percent being African American. Nationwide, a total of106 HBCUs produce six times as many African American college graduates and eight times as many African Americans graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs.\\nHBCUs around the nation are facing the financial challenge of a lifetime. In Alabama, some HBCUs have lost access to Upward Bound Funding grants, including school like Miles College, which has had an active Upward Bound program on its campus since the mid-1960s. Without these grants, hundreds of first-generation and underserved students will lose access to the financial support they need to pursue a competitive higher education.\\n###\\nRep. Terri A.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Tuesday, the House of Representatives adopted an amendment by Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) prohibiting federal grant funding from going to child care centers with a record of injury or death due to health or safety violations. The amendment’s adoption follows the death of five-year-old Kamden Johnson at an Alabama day care center. Rep. Sewell’s amendment was attached to a package of appropriations bills expected to pass the House this week.\\n“My amendment is a commonsense fix following a tragedy that we cannot allow to happen again,” said Rep. Sewell. “Kamden Johnson’s death this August was not the first child death at an unregulated day care center in Alabama, and it will not be the last so long as we continue to fund centers that violate health and safety standards. It is our responsibility to ensure that federal resources are directed to accountable centers that care for our children’s health and safety, especially as safe child care centers like Head Start struggle to receive the funding they need. I was happy to see my amendment pass tonight with bipartisan support, and I look forward to continuing work with my colleagues in Congress to improve safety at child care centers across the country. For our children, for parents, and for kids like Kamden, we can and must do better.”\\nKamden Johnson died this August after being left in a hot daycare van at a preschool he was attending in Mobile, Alabama. Due to a state exemption for religious affiliated day care centers, Kamden’s daycare center was not subject to state oversight or inspections. The driver who was responsible for Kamden when he died had an extensive criminal record.\\nAs of 2016, there were 943 day care centers in Alabama exempt from basic licensing standards. Over 30 Alabama legislators have come together to support a bipartisan bill extending licensing requirements to facilities currently exempt from oversight.\\n###\\nRep. Terri A.

Sewell (D-AL) and Congresswoman Gwen Moore (D-WI) led a letter with 41 Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, urging Secretary of Education Betsy Devos to provide clarity in denied Upward Bound grants to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as well as targeted assistance to HBCUs. During the FY17 grant period, a concerning number of HBCUs lost funding for their Upward Bound programs, many for non-substantive errors such as font or file format.\\n“Historically Black Colleges and Universities are an integral part of our nation’s education system and our history,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “For many of my constituents, these schools are where the first member of their family went to college and where the next generation is getting their degree. The Upward Bound program has been a critical asset to these HBCUs by providing millions of students with the security of an academic support system that can eliminate achievement gaps existing between the rich and the poor and between HBCU students and those who attend other institutions. Denying HBCUs this lifeline of support puts students at risk and our history at risk. We’re calling on Secretary Devos to work with Members of Congress to identify and address the issues that have led to such a devastating loss on our HBCU campuses.” \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“As the TRIO Caucus co-chair and an Upward Bound graduate, I am deeply concerned about the denial of grant funding to HBCUs. Upward Bound played an essential role in shaping my academic and professional success,” said Rep. Gwen Moore. “Funding must continue in order to ensure that future generations have access to these resources.\\xa0 We hope that Secretary DeVos will respond to this letter affirming her commitment to Upward Bound students at our historically Black colleges. This administration should work to mitigate disparities not aggravate them.”\\nIncluded among HBCUs which lost Upward Bound grants is Miles College, which has had an active Upward Bound program on its campus since the mid-1960s. Tuskegee University, Clark Atlanta University, West Virginia State University, Savannah State University are just some of the HBCUs where Upward Bound programs were founded during the pivotal years of the Civil Rights Movement and which have lost their programs during this year’s competition.\\nOn May 2nd, 32 Members of Congress sent a bipartisan letter led by Reps. Warren Davidson and Danny Davis requesting Secretary Devos’ reconsideration of Upward Bound applications denied on the basis of technical issues. The Department of Education announced later that month that it would use funding and flexibility provided by Congress in the FY2017 Omnibus to reconsider Upward Bound applications for institutions denied a grant due to non-substantive errors.\\nEvery federal program that infuses resources and creates enrollment pipelines is integral to the overall vitality of HBCUs, making it particularly problematic that a large number of our HBCUs lost their funding. Rep. Sewell’s June 30 letter to Secretary Devos urges targeted support for HBCUs as the Department of Education reconsiders current and future Upward Bound applications.\\n###\\nRep. Terri A.

The Reducing Barriers for Relative Foster Parents Act makes it easier for foster children to be placed in the home of a family member by encouraging states to update their foster care systems to promote such placements. Children raised by relatives experience increased stability, greater safety and permanency, and better behavioral and mental health outcomes.\\nIn an op-ed jointly released today, Reps. Sewell and Smucker made the following statement:\\n“For the children in our foster care system, these changes could mean the difference between finding a permanent loving home with their family or continued instability. Updating foster care standards will also provide foster parents and human resource caseworkers with consistent and coherent licensing standards that put the well-being of our children first. The Reducing Barriers for Relative Foster Parents Act is an opportunity for both parties to work together to address these challenges with a commonsense solution that helps keep families together.”\\n“When it comes to finding loving homes for children, there are no Republicans or Democrats -- just mothers and fathers, aunts and uncles, and sons and daughters who believe each child should have a bed to be tucked into at night in a loving home.”\\nAs a Member of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, Rep. Sewell regularly addresses issues relating to child welfare and the foster care system. This May, Rep.

This achievement proves that public schools in Birmingham can succeed in educating and preparing our children to compete nationally. I am honored to have Ramsey High School in the 7th congressional district and congratulate them on this outstanding recognition.\"\\nAbout Ramsey High School:\\nRamsay High School is located in Birmingham, Alabama beneath the foothills of Vulcan. Over 750 students throughout the Birmingham-metro area in grades nine through twelve are enrolled. A wide array of advance placement courses and extracurricular activities are offered. Ramsay is also an International Baccalaureate World School.\\nOver sixty percent of Ramsay’s students are economically disadvantaged. Approximately sixty percent of its students come from single parent families and 68 percent receive free or reduced lunch. Despite these circumstances, the consistent academic performance of the students enrolled has landed Ramsay as the 6th best high school in Alabama by World News Magazine and one of the best in the nation.\\nAbout the National Blue Ribbon Award:\\nThe DOE will honor Ramsay High School along with 235 other public and 50 private schools in a recognition ceremony today in Washington, D.C. Ramsay High School is one of five schools in Alabama that have been nominated for the national Blue Ribbon School program.\\n\\xa0\\n###',\n",

This bill keeps education funding at sequestration levels, removes accountability provisions, weakens requirement standards, and eliminates and weakens protections for disadvantaged students.\\nAs the daughter of two longtime educators, I know that education is the great equalizer.\\xa0This bill will not level the playing field but rather promote greater education disparity. H.R. 5 shifts funds away from vulnerable schools like many across the 7th Congressional District. This bill is not what students in my district, or any district in this nation, need to achieve the American Dream.\\nI acknowledge that the ESEA must be reauthorized and No Child Left Behind is long due for reform. This is why I support the Democratic substitute bill which includes key tenets of accountability, provides intervention and support to all students who need it and assures that students with disabilities are given the same chance to succeed as their peers.\\nI urge my colleagues to put aside partisan bickering.

       "  'text': 'Washington D.C.\\xa0— Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is awarding $43.9 million to the State of Alabama to support lead pipe replacement and ensure clean, safe drinking water for Alabama communities. She also announced the finalization of a new EPA rule to eliminate all lead pipes in Alabama’s drinking water systems within the next 10 years.\\nThe new rule and funding are part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to replacing every lead pipe in America within a decade. They were made possible by President Biden’s historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Rep. Sewell was the only member of Alabama’s congressional delegation to vote in favor of the law.\\n“For too long, our most vulnerable Alabamians have had their health and well-being threatened by exposure to lead-contaminated drinking water,”\\xa0said Rep. Sewell.\\xa0“But thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration, we are finally putting an end to this historic injustice. As the only Member of Congress from Alabama to vote in favor of President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, I am thrilled that Alabama will be receiving this monumental investment to replace dangerous lead pipes and improve the safety of our drinking water supply. We are so grateful to have an administration that is committed to ensuring every family has clean air to breathe and clean water to drink.”\\nLead in drinking water irreparably harms the health of children and adults and disproportionately impacts lower-income communities and communities of color. Legacy lead pipes, which have delivered drinking water to homes for decades, have exposed generations of Americans to toxic lead and will continue to do so until they are removed.\\xa0\\nThe $43.9 million announced today will flow through Alabama’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) and is available to support lead pipe replacement and inventory projects. 49% of the funding must be provided to disadvantaged communities as grant funding or principal forgiveness that does not have to be repaid. EPA also announced the availability of $35 million in competitive\\xa0grant funding\\xa0for reducing lead in drinking water. Communities are invited to apply directly for grant funding through this program. Additional federal funding is available to support lead pipe replacement projects and EPA has developed a\\xa0website identifying available funding sources.\\nIn addition to requiring the replacement of lead pipes within 10 years, the new\\xa0Lead\\xa0and Copper Rule Improvements (LCRI) require more rigorous testing of drinking water and a lower threshold requiring communities to take action to protect people from\\xa0lead\\xa0exposure in water. The final rule also improves communication within communities so that families are better informed about the risk of\\xa0lead\\xa0in drinking water, the location of\\xa0lead\\xa0pipes, and plans for replacing them.\\nInvestments in identifying lead pipes, planning for their removal, and replacing them will create jobs in local communities while strengthening the foundation of safe drinking water that supports economic opportunity.\\nFind more information on this announcement\\xa0here.\\n###',\n",

Sewell by naming it after her mother, the late Nancy Gardner Sewell, who lost her battle to pancreatic cancer in June 2021.\\nH.R. 2407 enjoys the support of bipartisan majorities in both the U.S. House and Senate and is endorsed by more than 500 organizations across the nation. It is currently co-sponsored by 285 members of the House of Representatives and 62 Senators.\\n“We are pleased to see the House Committee on Ways and Means take a step toward passing the bipartisan Nancy Gardner Sewell MCED Screening Coverage Act,” said Dr. Karen E. Knudsen, CEO of the American Cancer Society and American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. “We thank Representatives Jodey Arrington (R-TX) and Terri Sewell (D-AL) for continuing to champion this important legislation which has the potential to make a meaningful difference in the lives of Medicare enrollees and their families. In 2024, more than 2 million Americans are expected to be diagnosed with cancer and over 1 million of those cases are expected to be diagnosed in individuals over the age of 65. The Act creates a pathway to ensure timely Medicare coverage of new, innovative multi-cancer screening tests and expand access to early detection once clinical benefit is shown.”\\n“The Prevent Cancer Foundation celebrates this important step in making access to MCED tests closer to reality for millions of older Americans,” said Jody Hoyos, CEO of the Prevent Cancer Foundation. “Thank you to Representatives Jodey Arrington (R-TX) and Terri Sewell (D-AL) for their leadership. The advocacy community will continue to support legislation that brings early detection to all because Early Detection = Better Outcomes.”\\n“The Association of Cancer Care Centers (ACCC) greatly appreciates the House Committee on Ways and Means taking this important step toward passing the bipartisan Nancy Gardner Sewell Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act (H.R. 2407),” said ACCC Executive Director Christian Downs, JD, MHA. “We thank Representatives Jodey Arrington (R-TX) and Terri Sewell (D-AL) for their tireless advocacy on this important legislation. ACCC members are all too familiar with the toll cancer takes on patients when diagnosed at a late stage. Far too many patients have died because their cancer wasn’t caught early enough. Late-stage cancer diagnosis is often avoidable, and if cancers are caught earlier and proper treatment is administered, outcomes are typically more successful. This legislation will expand seniors’ access to advanced cancer screenings through the Medicare program—enabling earlier detection and improving outcomes.”\\n“We lose over 600,000 Americans every year to cancer, often because their cancers were detected too late,” said Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance’s President and CEO Audra Moran. “Many cancers, including ovarian cancer, have no recommended early screenings available. This status quo cannot stand. The Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act would ensure seniors’ timely access to MCED tests when they are deemed to be safe and effective by the FDA. Our nation’s health rests on equal access to quality healthcare and we're grateful to the committee and its members for this important action today.”\\n###\",\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) hosted a Seniors Resource Roundtable in Linden, Alabama. Representatives from AARP, the Social Security Administration, the Rural Health Medical Program, and the Alabama Tombigbee Regional Area on Aging were on hand to provide information and resources to seniors in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. Rep. Sewell highlighted how the Inflation Reduction Act is lowering health care and prescription drug costs for hundreds of thousands of Alabama seniors.

I understand that. President Biden understands that. And it’s why we have made delivering for our seniors a top priority.”\\nWith Rep. Sewell’s support, Congress passed and President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022. Thanks to the IRA’s $35 per month insulin price cap, more than 29,000 Alabama seniors who rely on insulin—including 3,800 in Alabama’s 7th District—are saving an average of $400 annually compared to 2020. As a result of this law, the three largest manufacturers of insulin, who supply nearly all the insulin in the United States, announced that they would slash the cost of their insulins by up to 75%.\\nThe IRA also caps out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries at $2,000 annually beginning in 2025 and empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices to get a better deal for seniors.\\n“The bottom line is this,”\\xa0continued Sewell.\\xa0“No senior should have to choose between putting food on the table or paying for life-saving medication. That’s why these savings matter.

       "  'text': 'Washington D.C. — Today, ahead of the 14th anniversary of the landmark Affordable Care Act (ACA), U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) celebrated its historic progress in lowering health care costs for Alabama families and vowed to continue building on its success. The ACA was signed by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010.\\n“Fourteen years after the Affordable Care Act was signed, more Americans have health insurance than at any time in history. Meanwhile, millions are benefitting from record-low premiums and no one can be charged more for having a pre-existing condition,” said Rep. Sewell. “Despite the relentless efforts by Republicans to repeal the ACA, President Biden and Democrats are committed to building on its success and continuing to lower costs. Last year, we capped the cost of insulin at $35 per month for seniors and starting in 2025, no senior will be charged more than $2,000 per year for out-of-pocket prescription drug costs.”\\n“Access to quality, affordable health care should be a right—not a privilege for the few,” continued Sewell. “We must keep working to improve the ACA and ensure every American gets the coverage they need.”\\nIn August 2023, the uninsured rate in the U.S. reached an all-time low of 7.7%. Shortly after, the 2024 open enrollment period shattered records with a historic 21.3 million Americans and 386,195 Alabamians signing up for health care coverage through the ACA exchange.\\nRep. Sewell has continued to champion health care accessibility for Alabamians. She was the only member of Alabama’s Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act which lowered monthly premiums by enhancing the ACA’s premium tax credits. Thanks to these policies, Americans are saving an average of $2,400 per year on health care premiums.\\nIn Congress, Rep. Sewell is leading legislation to save Alabama’s rural hospitals, bring more medical professionals to underserved communities, and ensure that seniors have access to cutting-edge cancer screenings.\\nShe continues to be a leading voice demanding that state leaders expand Medicaid so that every Alabamian gets the coverage they need.',\n",

Stefanik.\\xa0“Our service members and their families endure many hardships, ensuring accessible maternal healthcare should not be one of them. As a mom, it is despicable to read\\xa0reports\\xa0of expecting mothers being turned away from hospitals on military installations due to a shortage in full-service medical staff. Service members and their families selflessly serve our nation and it is our responsibility to take care of them and their families during the most important moments of their lives.”\\n“Ensuring the well-being of our military families means addressing the unique challenges mothers face while they, or their spouses, serve in the military,”\\xa0said Sen.

It is unconscionable that House Republicans would hurt working families, damage our economy, and endanger our national security.”\\n“I will continue to do everything in my power to keep the government open and protect the programs that Alabamians rely on,” continued Sewell. “It’s time for House Republicans to do their jobs, put American families first, and stop charging towards a government shutdown.”\\nAccording to new data released by House Budget Committee Minority, a Republican government shutdown would:\\n\\nForce troops to serve without pay: 38,017 active duty and reserve personnel serving our nation's armed forces in Alabama would be forced to go without the pay they earn during a shutdown.\\nHurt Alabama small businesses: The Small Business Administration would stop processing small business loans, halting a program that provides $284,694,700 in funding to small businesses in Alabama every year.\\nDisrupt air travel: 4,797 people flying through Alabama airports every day would face potential delays and safety concerns due to staffing impacts on TSA agents and air traffic controllers.\\nCut off food assistance for Alabama children and families: 111,999 people in Alabama would soon lose access to Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits. 772,813 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) beneficiaries in Alabama would lose access to benefits in a prolonged shutdown.\\nHurt federal workers: 46,826 federal workers in Alabama would be furloughed or forced to work without pay, in addition to the many employees of businesses with government contracts who could be laid off, furloughed, or see their hours cut.\\nJeopardize food and drug safety: Workers at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would be sidelined, risking interruptions and delays to the 224 food safety, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and other inspections conducted in Alabama last year.\\nHurt rural Alabamians’ ability to secure housing loans: The Department of Agriculture would be forced to stop processing housing loans, which provide $545,442,546 in funding to help 3,049 families in rural Alabama communities buy homes every year.\\nHurt Alabama farmers: The Department of Agriculture would be forced to stop processing farm loans which provide $93,451,000 in funding for farmers in Alabama every year.\\nClose National Parks: 1,294,952 people who visit national parks in Alabama every year would be turned away or unable to fully access parks, monuments, and museums.\\nPut vulnerable families at risk: State governments would be forced to pay for federal services like the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, potentially risking benefits for the 12,888 TANF beneficiaries in Alabama.\\n\\nConstituents with questions about the impacts of a Republican government shutdown can visit sewell.house.gov/governmentshutdown.\",\n",

Rep.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C.\\xa0– U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Adrian Smith (NE-03) introduced the Preserving Access to Home Health Act of 2023. This bipartisan legislation would help preserve access to home health services for seniors and Americans with disabilities by preventing proposed cuts to home health payment rates from taking effect.\\n“Home health services are a lifeline for so many Alabama seniors and people with disabilities, allowing patients to receive the treatment they need in the comfort of their own homes,”\\xa0said Rep. Sewell.\\xa0“I am very concerned about the impact that proposed cuts to Medicare’s home health program would have on these patients and their families. It is imperative that we prevent such cuts from taking effect, which is why I’m introducing the Preserving Access to Home Health Act in the House of Representatives. I want to thank Rep. Smith for his collaboration in this bipartisan effort, and I urge my colleagues to join us.”\\n“Home health can lower the cost of care for patients and help hospitals to safely transition patients back to home living,”\\xa0said Rep. Adrian Smith.\\xa0“I have serious concerns these planned cuts to Medicare would result in worse outcomes for seniors and higher costs burdens in the long run. This bill would halt the counterproductive payment cuts and increase transparency in Medicare payment policy calculations. I thank my Senate colleagues and Rep. Sewell for their collaboration on this bill.”\\nHome health care allows approximately 3.5 million Medicare beneficiaries to be treated in the cost-effective setting they prefer most—their homes. Home health services are a lifeline for seniors, people with disabilities, and those with limited mobility, and became even more essential during the COVID-19 public health emergency.\\nIn June, Medicare announced plans to implement cuts totaling -9.36% to its home healthcare program starting in 2024, on top of the 3.9% cut that began in 2023. These new cuts could total up to $20 billion over the next 10 years and could make it harder for patients to leave the hospital and go home with care that helps them recover and rehabilitate.\\nThe Preserving Access to Home Health Act would address the deep cuts made to home health that began this year and will continue until at least 2028. The legislation:\\n\\nRestricts CMS from making any cuts to home health.\\nRequires MedPAC, which advises Congress on payment policy, to gain a full understanding of the economics of the home healthcare system, including how the Medicare program, the Medicaid program, and the Medicare Advantage program all contribute to a system.\\n\\n“Patients leaving the hospital need a smooth transition home but are finding it increasingly difficult to find Medicare home health providers, signaling an immediate need for Congress to intervene and block Medicare from making such strident cuts to home health again this year,”\\xa0said Joanne Cunningham, CEO of the Partnership for Quality Home Healthcare.\\xa0“Data suggest that Medicare’s continued cuts to home health are restricting patient access to the safest and lowest-cost care setting following a hospital stay.”\\n“The Medicare home health community strongly supports this legislation and thanks Representatives Sewell and Smith for their leadership on a Medicare issue that truly threatens access to care for the more than 3 million beneficiaries who rely on this care,”\\xa0said William A. Dombi, President of the National Association for Home Care & Hospice.\\xa0“The home health community calls on Congress to ensure the stability that patients and providers urgently need. Since Medicare has again proposed deep cuts to home health in 2024, Congress must act to protect the care their constituents prefer and want.”\\n“We commend Congresswoman Sewell for her commitment to home health and for leading this bipartisan legislation to help ensure Medicare’s invaluable home health care services are available when patients need them most,”\\xa0said Barbara Jacobsmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Enhabit Home Health & Hospice.\\xa0“Congresswoman Sewell has been a true champion for home health issues during her time in Congress, and she understands how home health helps patients and families transition from hospital to home with compassionate, patient-centered care. Whether patients are recovering from surgery or managing a chronic illness or recent injury, Medicare home health is an essential part of the care continuum. We are grateful for the support from the Congresswoman and look forward to working with others in Congress to help protect Medicare’s home health benefit.”\\nSenators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Susan Collins (R-ME) introduced\\xa0companion legislation\\xa0in the U.S. Senate on June 22.\\xa0\\nBill text can be found\\xa0here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington D.C. – U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined Rep. Gus Bilirakis (FL-12) in introducing H.R. 4011, the Timely Access to Clinical Treatment (TACT) Act. This bipartisan legislation would require that patients be provided their oral drugs within an acceptable time frame.\\n“Undergoing treatment for a serious illness is difficult enough. No patient should also have to worry about delays in receiving potentially life-saving medication,” said Rep. Sewell. “The TACT Act is a simple, commonsense solution that would remove unnecessary roadblocks and empower doctors to get their patients the critical care that they need in a timely manner. I am proud to introduce this bill and urge my colleagues to support it.”\\n“This bill is about removing the red tape within our healthcare system and ensuring that patients have timely access to their medications,” said Rep. Gus Bilirakis. “Doctors, not bureaucrats, best understand the needs of their patients and should be empowered with the tools needed to provide the best possible care—especially when time is of the essence.”\\nPatients’ access to the appropriate medically necessary treatment within a reasonable time frame is increasingly challenged by our complex health care delivery system. This is especially true for oral drugs. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), health insurance plan sponsors, and specialty and mail order pharmacies are notorious for slowing down the process by which patients receive their oral drugs, even in cases where specialty practices can provide those drugs at the site of care via an in-house pharmacy or dispensing facility. In some cases, PBMs even disallow the drugs prescribed.\\xa0\\nThe TACT Act provides a simple solution by requiring that patients be provided their oral drugs within an acceptable time frame of 72 hours, allowing for situations—such as acquiring financial support—that are understandable and reasonable.\\nSpecifically, the TACT Act will:\\xa0\\n\\nRequire PBMs, plan sponsors, insurers, and contract pharmacies, including specialty and mail order pharmacies, to ensure that patients are able to receive their prescription medication within 72 hours of having the prescription submitted to the patient’s pharmacy benefit plan provider in order to ensure that there is not undo delay in the initiation of the patient’s treatment;\\nAllow patients who are not able to receive their prescription from a pharmacy benefit plan provider within 72 hours to seek pharmacy services and receive their prescription medication from any other duly-licensed entity that can fill the patient’s prescription and require that it be covered under the patient’s plan with full use of the patient’s applicable benefit(s);\\nRequire pharmacy benefit plan providers receiving the prescription to confirm within 24 hours to the patient’s prescriber receipt of the prescription and the ability to fill it within the 72-hour period; and\\nRequire that any prior authorization required by the pharmacy benefit plan provider take place in such a time that the 72-hour time limit is not exceeded.\\n\\n“The Timely Access to Clinical Treatment legislation is vital for patients with cancer and other serious diseases across the country,” said Ted Okon, Executive Director of the Community Oncology Alliance. “We hear stories daily about patients not being able to receive their potentially life-saving cancer treatments because of needless delays by contract pharmacies. We applaud Congressman Bilirakis and Congresswoman Terri Sewell for leading this effort to empower patients to ensure they receive their medications in a timely manner.”',\n",

       "  'text': \"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Drew Ferguson (GA-03),\\xa0 introduced the Save Rural Hospitals Act of 2023. This legislation would help curb the alarming trend of hospital closures in rural communities by ensuring that rural hospitals are fairly reimbursed by Medicare.\\n“All across Alabama, we’ve seen the devastating impact of rural hospital closures which only accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Rep. Sewell. “It is unacceptable that so many Alabamians are being forced to drive hours to receive life-saving care. With this bipartisan legislation, we’re taking action to help keep rural hospitals open by ensuring that they are fairly reimbursed for the critical services they provide. I’m proud to join Congressman Ferguson in this effort and urge my colleagues to join us!”\\n“Rural hospitals play an essential role in serving their communities and providing vital care to patients,” said Rep. Ferguson. “Georgia has one of the lowest reimbursement rates nationwide, and the Save Rural Hospitals Act would help put rural hospitals in the Peach State – and across the country – on a level playing field by raising their Medicare reimbursement levels. I am proud to work with Representative Sewell on this bipartisan legislation.”\\nIn the U.S., rural hospitals are closing at an alarming rate with more than 194 rural hospitals having closed since 2005. During the COVID-19 pandemic, rural hospital closures accelerated to record levels. In February, the Alabama Hospital Association warned that more than a dozen of the state's rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closing. Low patient volumes and significant financial strain are often the primary factors in these closures, compounded by the flawed Medicare Area Wage Index that results in rural hospitals receiving disproportionately low reimbursement rates.\\xa0\\nThe Save Rural Hospitals Act would establish an appropriate national minimum (0.85) for the Medicare Area Wage Index to ensure that rural hospitals receive adequate payment for the care they provide, while preserving the existing reimbursements for urban hospitals. This legislation would also help ensure fairness in reimbursements for hospitals across the country—including the many hospitals that are facing closures in rural areas—and fix severe and disproportionate disadvantages that unfairly penalize hundreds of communities and hospitals across the country.\\xa0\\n“We applaud Congresswoman Sewell's steadfast priority for initiatives that strengthen access to health care for the most vulnerable citizens in Alabama,” said Danne Howard, Deputy Director of the Alabama Hospital Association. “The Save Rural Hospitals Act will help address the decades-old flaw in the Medicare reimbursement methodology that has negatively impacted Alabama hospitals more than in any state in our nation. Our hospitals have survived on reserves, cost-cutting measures, staff reductions, and eliminating services. Those options are counter to the mission of Alabama's hospitals in providing quality care to their communities. The compounded impact of the Medicare disparity has created pressures that are unsustainable. Our options have been exhausted. If nothing changes, more hospitals across our state will be forced to make difficult decisions about their future operations, the services and the jobs they support. Rural America has experienced more than 100 hospital closures since 2010, and many continue to face limited or no access to specialty care. The Save Rural Hospitals Act will ensure that Alabamians have equal access to care and are not disadvantaged for living in a majority rural state.”\\nCompanion legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA).\\nThe Save the Rural Hospitals Act of 2023 is available here.\",\n",

       "  'date': 'April 28, 2023',\n",
       "  'text': 'Birmingham, AL – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced $1.2 million for the Community Action Association of Alabama to help alleviate the need for diapers among Alabama’s babies and toddlers. This grant is designed to expand existing diaper distribution programs as part of the Diaper Distribution Demonstration and Research Pilot at the Administration of Children and Families (ACF) at the Department of Health and Human Services. The program, also known as the Diaper Distribution Pilot, channels new funding to expand existing diaper distribution services through the robust network of anti-poverty services funded by ACF’s Office of Community Services (OCS).\\n“Alabama’s working families know all too well just how expensive purchasing diapers can be,” said Rep. Sewell. “In fact, for workers earning minimum wage, diapers can cost up to 8% of their total income. With this $1.2 million grant, we are taking an important step toward ensuring that all of our families have the diapers they need to keep our babies clean, healthy, and happy. I know that this will make a big difference for many of Alabama’s most vulnerable families.”\\nDiapers are essential for the health and wellbeing of babies and toddlers, but one in three families in the United States does not have enough of them. Diapers alone can cost 8% of a person’s total income if they are earning federal minimum wage, and parents and caregivers who do not have enough diapers often cannot drop their children off at child care. This means that parents cannot go to work, and babies and toddlers are more susceptible to painful rashes and infections. A lack of diapers is not only a public health issue, it is a formidable obstacle to economic mobility for families with low incomes.\\nThe Community Action Association of Alabama (CAAA) works to better focus local, state, private, and federal resources to assist low-income individuals and families statewide. CAAA is a partnership made up of 18 Community Action Agencies funded by the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) working to produce measurable outcomes and results to eliminate poverty. Using the $1.2 million awarded for the Diaper Pilot, CAAA will distribute diapers and diapering supplies to low-income families while providing parenting education and increasing access to wrap-around services. CAAA will collaborate with multiple partners including agency Early Head Start programs, the National Diaper Bank Network, and local community organizations such as:\\n\\nVOICES for Alabama’s Children\\nLow-Income Housing Coalition of Alabama\\nCollaborative Solutions\\nAlabama Possible\\nBundles of Hope Diaper Bank\\nWhatley Health Services\\nCommunity Service Programs of West Alabama, Inc.

       "  'date': 'March 30, 2023',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined Reps. Jodey Arrington (TX-19), Richard Hudson (NC-09), and Raul Ruiz (CA-25) to introduce the Nancy Gardner Sewell Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) Screening Coverage Act, named for Rep. Sewell’s late mother who passed away in 2021 from pancreatic cancer. This bipartisan legislation would create a pathway for Medicare to cover emerging blood-based cancer screenings which hold the potential to catch cancer earlier than ever before. Last Congress, the bill garnered the support of a bipartisan majority of both the House and Senate—with 258 House cosponsors and 54 Senate cosponsors—and over 400 organizations across the nation.\\xa0\\n“No family in America has been spared the scourge of cancer,” said Rep. Sewell, lead Democratic sponsor. “Fortunately, innovative multi-cancer early detection screenings are emerging which hold the potential to detect cancer earlier than ever before. I’m proud to once again introduce the Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act, named for my late mother Nancy Gardner Sewell, to ensure that our seniors can access these tools once they are FDA approved. Not only will this bill save lives, but it will also help reduce the glaring racial disparities in cancer diagnosis and death. I look forward to harnessing our momentum from the 117th Congress to get this bill across the finish line!”\\n“Multi-cancer early detection is one of the many incredible examples of the United States leading in medical innovation,” said Rep. Arrington, lead Republican sponsor. “This type of screening has the potential to improve quality of life for millions of American cancer patients and their families while saving taxpayer dollars by treating cancer before it spreads. I am proud of the bipartisan support this bill gained last Congress and remain firm in my belief that this legislation will drastically improve our ability to treat and prevent cancer.”\\n“Too many families are devastated by a cancer diagnosis every day in the United States,” said Rep. Hudson. “By increasing access to multi-cancer early detection screening tests through Medicare, we can detect cancers sooner and save lives in North Carolina and around the country. As a member of the Health Subcommittee, I once again look forward to advancing this bipartisan legislation.”\\xa0\\n\"Detecting cancer early improves health outcomes and saves lives,\" said Dr. Ruiz. \"With innovative medical technologies, we can catch more cancers earlier than ever, but patients must be able to access these screenings. That\\'s why it\\'s very important for Medicare policy to keep pace with the development of multi-cancer screenings. I am glad to join my colleagues in introducing the Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act to modernize Medicare coverage so older Americans can access these screenings and improve their health outcomes.\"\\xa0\\nBackground:\\nThe Nancy Gardner Sewell Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act would increase seniors’ timely access to multi-cancer early detection technology by creating a pathway to Medicare coverage. This bill will allow for Medicare coverage of MCED screenings once they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration. New MCED screening tools will complement existing screening and dramatically improve our nation’s cancer early detection capabilities. Currently, we are only able to commonly screen for five cancers and just 14% of cancers are found through screenings.\\xa0\\nThe impact of late-stage cancer diagnosis is magnified in communities of color and throughout rural America where overall cancer outcomes are worse. These tools introduce a significant shift in the cancer screening landscape. Ensuring seniors have timely access is essential since age is the primary risk factor for cancer and more than 70% of cancer diagnoses are in the Medicare population. This legislation will open the door to a new era of detecting and treating cancer while ensuring that our most vulnerable citizens are not left behind.\\nSpecifically, the legislation would:\\n\\nCreate the authority for CMS to cover blood-based MCED tests and future test methods once approved by the FDA and shown to have clinical benefit.\\nMaintain CMS’ authority to use an evidence-based process to determine coverage parameters for these new tests.\\nClarify that (1) these new tools will complement, not replace, existing screenings and coverage and (2) cost sharing will not be impacted.\\n\\n“People of color are at the greatest risk for cancer deaths, at least partly because of disparities in early detection,” said Thomas “Ted” Greer Jr., CEO of Alabama Regional Medical Services based in Birmingham, Alabama. “We believe new screening technologies offer a chance to reduce those disparities, and we applaud Rep. Sewell’s steadfast leadership to clear a path for these tests to be accessible to those at highest risk for cancer.”\\xa0\\n“The Multi Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act would potentially expand access to cancer screenings in Medicare. The bill would allow the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to initiate an evidence-based coverage process for a multi-cancer screening test following FDA approval and once shown to have clinical benefit. ACS CAN supports the Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act to provide Medicare coverage of screening tests that are FDA approved. Cancer screening and early detection are key priorities for ACS CAN.” – American Cancer Society, Cancer Action Network\\n“Early detection of cancer is vital to closing the gap in screening and eliminating the scourge of preventable death, hospitalizations and high costs on minority and disadvantaged populations. With only 14% of cancers found with current available screening, far too many lives are lost to late stage cancer diagnosis. National Minority Quality Forum is dedicated to shifting cancer stage diagnosis and applaud the tireless work of Representatives Arrington, Sewell, Hudson, and Ruiz to introduce legislation that will help ensure access to MCED tests within Medicare once they are approved by the FDA.” – National Minority Quality Forum\\n“The importance of detecting cancer early cannot be overstated. With the Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act, Congress can unlock a new era in how cancer is detected and treated. We thank the sponsors and cosponsors for recognizing that older adults are at the most risk for cancer and we must create a pathway to access the latest cancer detection tools. We’ve been proud to bring an astounding 400+ organizations together in calling for the passage of the bill. Let’s make early detection a reality for Medicare beneficiaries.” – Prevent Cancer Foundation\\n“MCED technology holds the potential to alter the current cancer screening paradigm by providing the oncology community with the tools they need to find many more cancers in earlier, more treatable stages. ACCC is committed to advancing best practices and policies that will facilitate the integration of MCED tests into our health care system and that includes supporting the Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act. The war on cancer requires an all-hands-on deck approach and we need new tools, like MCED, to make a major impact. We’re grateful to leaders in Congress who are working to ensure older Americans can access this important new cancer screening tool.” – Association of Community Cancer Centers\\n“Having served hundreds of thousands of patients since our founding, we at the Cancer Support Community (CSC) have witnessed both the experiences of those who benefited from early detection of their cancer and those who did not and were often diagnosed at later stages, due to barriers in knowledge, access, both coverage and logistical, or lack of existing tests for their cancer. On behalf of CSC, we are proud to add our voice to the chorus in urging passage of the Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act which has widespread support from Congress and the cancer community and applaud Representatives Arrington, Sewell, Hudson, and Ruiz for helping to ensure that government keeps up with the speed of healthcare innovation.” – Cancer Support Community\\n“The lung cancer community knows how important cancer screening tests are for treating and even curing the disease. But we need early detection capabilities for many more cancers and we need it urgently to save lives. That’s what multi-cancer early detection technology offers through a simple blood draw that screens for dozens of cancers. Representatives Arrington, Sewell, Hudson, and Ruiz are doing the important work of championing access to MCED tests within Medicare. The Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act will help remove barriers that could prevent use of the tests by those most at-risk for all cancers – older Americans. We urge others to join them in this fight.” – GO2 for Lung Cancer\\n“The Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act is an important step toward early detection for many cancers. We are making real progress in screening more Americans for colorectal cancer and innovations in screening tools is a key part of that. As technology advances, we must ensure that all patients have access to new, safe and effective technology. We commend Representatives Arrington, Sewell, Hudson, and Ruiz for taking an important step in that direction and working to have fewer Americans receive a cancer diagnosis.” – FIGHT Colorectal Cancer\\nFind bill text here.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) introduced the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act of 2023. This bipartisan legislation would combat the nation’s physician shortage and improve access to health care by expanding the number of Medicare-supported medical residency positions by 14,000 over seven years.\\n“In Alabama and all across the nation, we are facing an urgent physician shortage that will only get worse as our population continues to age,” said Rep. Sewell, lead sponsor. “By adding 14,000 new graduate medical education residency positions over the next seven years, this critical legislation will give hospitals and health centers the tools they need to improve access to care, lower wait times for patients, and create a pipeline of qualified medical professionals to serve Americans’ health needs.”\\n“In the face of a severe physician shortage, it is more important than ever to have highly-trained doctors in our hospitals,” said Rep. Fitzpatrick, lead Republican sponsor. “The bipartisan Resident Physician Shortage Act will create more opportunities for aspiring doctors to join residency programs and help meet the growing demand for high-quality health care.”\\nAccording to data from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), the United States faces a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034, with demand for physicians outpacing supply. The nation’s demographics—particularly population growth and aging—serve as the primary driver of increasing demand for physician services. As the population continues to age and requires more medical care, it is critical to ensure there are enough physicians to care for those who need physician services. In addition, as a large portion of the physician workforce nears traditional retirement age, there is a critical need to educate and train more physicians to ensure there are enough physicians to care for patients across all communities in the future.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The residency positions in the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act are a critical step in working to address the nation’s dire physician shortage,” said Association of American Medical Colleges President and CEO David J. Skorton, MD. “We thank Reps. Sewell and Fitzpatrick for their dedication to ensuring access to high-quality health care for all by expanding critical investments in physician training. By strategically targeting these new medical residency positions at a wide variety of teaching hospitals, we are also strengthening and diversifying the health care workforce and improving critical access to care for patients, families, and communities across the country.”\\n“Hospitals are emerging from the pandemic with the dual crises of soaring inflation and a worsening labor shortage,” said Greater New York Hospital Association President Kenneth E. Raske. “The time to reinvest in our physician workforce is now. GNYHA strongly supports this important bill, which tackles the physician shortage head-on by adding 14,000 Medicare-funded graduate medical education slots. The teaching hospital community thanks Representatives Sewell and Fitzpatrick for their leadership on this vital issue.”',\n",

With the American Rescue Plan, we lowered premiums for 219,000 Alabamians through the ACA marketplace and locked in those savings in the Inflation Reduction Act. Starting this year, no senior will pay more than $35 per month for insulin, and soon, our provisions to cap prescription drug costs and negotiate drug prices will take effect, providing critical savings for our seniors.\\n“To be clear, our work is far from over. In Congress, I am fighting every day to save Alabama’s rural hospitals, close the Medicaid coverage gap, and continue to bring down costs. I will continue to vigorously oppose attempts by my Republican colleagues to cut Medicare, strip Americans of their health care coverage, and roll back our progress.\\n“In this great nation of so much wealth and prosperity, no American should go without health care coverage. After all, access to quality, affordable health care is a right and not a privilege. I will continue working to improve the Affordable Care Act and bring down health care costs for the great people I represent.”',\n",

Earl Carter (R-GA) and Paul Tonko (D-NY) introduced the bipartisan Protecting Access to Ground Ambulance Medical Services Act of 2023. This bill would ensure that ambulance service providers continue delivering quality healthcare services and lifesaving medical assistance.\\n“As we saw during the COVID-19 pandemic, our first responders provide irreplaceable care to those in need no matter where they are,” said Rep. Sewell. “However, due to the current Medicare reimbursement rate, these life-saving services come at a grave cost, especially to our rural communities, which are often too far from a traditional hospital. This bill addresses the critical need for ground ambulances in our most vulnerable communities, and I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing this bill with bipartisan support.\"\\n“When seconds are the difference between life and death, first responders arrive at the scene to provide life-saving care. This bill delivers key reforms so that Americans, particularly those in rural and underserved communities, can access ground ambulance transportation, and their providers can rely on consistent reimbursement from Medicare. This bill would help keep ambulance costs affordable,” said Rep. Wenstrup.\\n“When you’re in an emergency, timely access to an ambulance can mean the difference between life and death. With this bill, we will ensure that everyone, including those in remote or rural areas, has access to this life-saving care and that those who provide it receive proper Medicare reimbursement,” said Rep. Carter.\\n“Our emergency responders work every day on the frontlines to provide lifesaving care to our communities, and their invaluable role is even greater in rural and underserved areas, where hospitals and access to medical care are many miles away. This legislation addresses gaps in access to ambulance services and ensures that Americans are delivered affordable care, no matter where they live.

Terri Sewell (AL-07), Darin LaHood (IL-18), and David Kustoff (TN-08), introduced bipartisan legislation to break down barriers to mental health services and substance use disorder crisis services. H.R. 8892, the Access to Mental Health Services Act, will heighten awareness of such services and identify gaps in coverage under private insurance. The legislation will help to ensure that Americans can get the help they need, especially in times of crisis.\\n“Alabamians suffering from mental health and substance use disorders deserve our compassion and support,”\\xa0said Rep. Sewell.\\xa0“We in Congress must ensure that Americans have access to the treatment and services they need to recover. That’s why as we celebrate National Recovery Month, I’m proud to join with my colleagues across the aisle to introduce the Access to Mental Health Services Act. This critical legislation would help break down barriers to mental health services for those who need them most and marks a critical step toward addressing our nation's mental health crisis.”\\n“Mental and behavioral health services are critical components of our health care system, and Congress can do more to ensure patients better understand their access to these services, especially in rural communities like those in the 18th\\xa0District of Illinois,”\\xa0said Rep. Darin LaHood.\\xa0“This bipartisan bill will help mental and behavioral health care providers to better treat patients and increase access to mental health care services, particularly in situations of mental health crisis care, while also protecting patients from surprise medical billing. On the Ways and Means Committee, I will continue to be an advocate for our mental and behavioral health care providers and patients in central and west-central Illinois.”\\n“It is crucial that Americans have access to mental health and substance use disorder crisis services,”\\xa0said Rep. David Kustoff.\\xa0“I am pleased to join Representatives LaHood and Sewell in introducing the\\xa0Access to Mental Health Services Act of 2022, a bipartisan bill to help break down barriers to mental health services and support patients and healthcare providers across the country. This legislation will heighten the awareness and availability of these essential services for individuals who are struggling with their own mental health. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.”\\xa0\\nCoverage for mental health crisis services under private insurance varies, and limited availability of in-network providers can restrict access for patients. While many do have access to such services, they may not know where to access them or may worry about the perceived stigma of obtaining such mental health crisis services. The landmark No Surprises Act (NSA) provides new federal consumer protections against surprise medical bills for all emergency services and certain non-emergency services. However, while the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury have clarified that certain mental health crisis care settings fall under the NSA’s definition of emergency services and guarantee such consumer protections, others do not.\\nAccordingly, H.R. 8892 seeks to expand outreach efforts and identify private insurance barriers to accessing mental health crisis services:\\n\\nHeightening awareness of such services:\\xa0This bill requires the Departments to conduct an outreach campaign regarding the availability of mental health crisis services under private insurance. In addition, the outreach campaign would promote the potential benefits of accessing such services and seek to address any perceived stigma in obtaining such services.\\nIdentifying potential coverage gaps:\\xa0This bill requires the Departments to submit a report to Congress concerning private insurance coverage for mental health crisis services, any potential barriers to accessing such services, and potential issues related to unexpected surprise medical bills.\\n\\nBill text for H.R. 8892 can be found\\xa0here.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Birmingham, AL -\\xa0Today U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), awarded AIDS Alabama a $2,342,245 grant for its Navigator funding. This grant is a part of the $98.9 million grant funding returning to Navigator organizations ahead of the 2023 Open Enrollment Period to provide additional assistance to Alabamians shopping for and enrolling in plans through the Marketplace, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\\xa0Enroll Alabama, AIDS Alabama’s health care navigator program, has been federally funded since the program’s inception in 2013.\\xa0\\n“This is great news! Enroll Alabama has been a beacon of hope for countless Alabamians, serving as a critical resource in our work to get people in every corner of the state enrolled in health coverage. Since the Navigator program was created with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2013, I have heard directly from countless Alabamians who enrolled in health coverage for the first time in their lives thanks to an Enroll Alabama Navigator who helped them sign up,”\\xa0said Rep. Sewell.\\xa0\\xa0“Thanks to this investment, Enroll Alabama will be able to retain staff and hire more navigators to help Alabamians find affordable, comprehensive health coverage.”\\n“AIDS Alabama and the Enroll Alabama program are thrilled to receive these funds.

       "  'title': 'Rep. Sewell Votes to Send Historic Inflation Reduction Act to President Biden’s Desk',\n",
       "  'date': 'August 12, 2022',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, a historic legislative package that will tackle inflation, drive down health care and energy costs, cut the deficit, and make the largest investment to combat climate change in United States history. The bill is fully paid for by making the wealthiest corporations begin to pay their fair share. Included in the bill is Rep. Sewell’s climate justice legislation to reduce pollution and promote carbon capture technology. The Inflation Reduction Act passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 220-207 with every Democrat voting in favor of this significant legislation. Having passed the Senate last Sunday, the bill now heads to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.\\n“With passage of the historic Inflation Reduction Act, Congressional Democrats have once again delivered a major victory for the American people, the State of Alabama, and our planet!” said Rep. Sewell. “This bill caps drug costs for Alabama seniors and extends critical health care subsidies to drive down costs for families, all without raising taxes on anyone making under $400,000 per year. Instead, this bill is fully paid for by making the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share.”\\n“The Inflation Reduction Act also marks a major turning point in our fight to advance environmental justice, reduce pollution, and combat climate change,” continued Sewell. “I was proud to see that my bill, the Carbon Capture and Sequestration Expansion Act, was included in the climate title of this bill. While my colleagues on the other side spread falsehoods to protect billion-dollar corporations and special interests, I’m proud that my Democratic colleagues and I once again came together to deliver legislation that puts people over politics. I know this legislation will make a world of difference for so many Alabama families.”\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act takes bold action to lower health care costs and slash prescription drug costs for Alabamians. By extending the Affordable Care Act enhanced subsidies that are set to expire in January 2023 for three more years, the Inflation Reduction Act locks in lower health care premiums for 209,000 Alabamians who will save an average of $800 annually per person. It also empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prices for about 100 high cost, single-source drugs over the next decade. For Medicare beneficiaries, the bill caps out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 annually and caps the cost of insulin at $35 per month. Under this bill, if drug companies raise prices in Medicare faster than the rate of inflation, they are required to pay rebates back to Medicare for the difference, beginning in October 2022.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act is the largest investment to fight climate change, clean up pollution, and advance environmental justice in U.S. history. The bill’s $370 billion in climate resiliency investments would reduce U.S. carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030, and its $60 billion in environmental justice priorities will drive investments into disadvantaged communities. Notably, thanks to a provision cosponsored by Rep. Sewell, the bill reinstates the Superfund tax on crude oil and petroleum products to ensure that Superfund sites like the one in North Birmingham have the resources needed for environmental cleanup. The bill also includes Sewell’s climate justice legislation, the Carbon Capture and Sequestration Expansion Act, to reduce pollution and promote carbon capture technology.\\nContrary to Republican falsehoods, the Inflation Reduction Act contains no new taxes on families making $400,000 or less and no new taxes on small businesses. The bill is fully paid for by strengthening IRS enforcement against wealthy tax cheats, closing tax loopholes exploited by the wealthiest few, and implementing a 15% corporate minimum tax—which applies only to the 150 corporations earning over $1 billion in profits. Thanks to these provisions, the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to reduce the deficit by over $300 billion over the next decade.\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act enjoys bipartisan support from the American people, as well as a wide range of experts, climate activists, labor unions, business leaders and advocacy organizations. Over 7 in 10 voters overwhelmingly back the Inflation Reduction Act, including 95 percent of Democrats, nearly three-quarters of independents, and more than half of Republicans, according to a recent poll by Data for Progress.',\n",

       "  'date': 'August 8, 2022',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. — U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Jason Smith (MO-08) introduced H.R. 8580, the Long Term Care Hospital (LTCH) Access and Stability Act. This bipartisan legislation would extend pandemic-era Medicare payment policies for LTCHs for one year after the end of the Public Health Emergency (PHE). Such an extension would prevent steep and sudden Medicare payment cuts to LTCHs and allow these specialized hospitals time to transition back to pre-pandemic policies. By supporting LTCHs, the LTCH Access and Stability Act would help ensure that long-term acute care services remain available for communities that need them.\\n“Long Term Care Hospitals have played such a critical role in treating patients with COVID-19 and those with chronic conditions, but without action, these hospitals will soon face devastating payment cuts that threaten their ability to provide lifesaving care,” said Rep. Sewell. “I thank my colleague, Congressman Jason Smith, for joining me in introducing the LTCH Access and Stability Act which would give these facilities time to transition back to pre-pandemic payment policies. We must ensure that these hospitals can continue to operate for those who rely on them.”\\n“Long Term Care Hospitals play a unique and vital role in our nation’s health care system—and are particularly critical in rural areas,” said Rep. Smith. “COVID-19 strained the resources of facilities that treated these patients, and as we adjust back to pre-pandemic policies, we need to ensure adequate transition time for facilities like LTCHs, which were the tip of the spear in rural America. This legislation will ensure LTCHs have additional time to adjust their resources, keep their doors open, and—most importantly—continue providing life-changing care to patients affected by serious long-term medical illnesses in Missouri and across the nation.”\\nLTCHs are designed to care for severely ill patients who, though clinically stable, still require complex medical treatment such as mechanical ventilation. This makes them ideal treatment facilities for patients with COVID-19. To preserve access to long-term care hospitals and increase patient capacity during the pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act created a more flexible Medicare payment policy for LTCHs by waiving the previous “site neutral” policy for the duration of the PHE. This waiver allowed for LTCHs to serve patients they previously did not—including those suffering from COVID-19—and helped free beds in short-term acute-care hospitals.\\xa0\\nAs the COVID emergency winds down, this flexibility for patient capacity will expire, forcing devastating cuts to LTCHs across the country. At the same time, these hospitals face the same challenges as other hospitals, including workforce shortages, supply chain constraints, and rising costs. The LTCH Access and Stability Act would extend the current Medicare payment policy for LTCHs for one year after the end of the PHE, creating a one-year transition period back to pre-pandemic policies and ensuring that patients can continue to access the lifesaving care these hospitals provide.\\n“The Coalition of Long-Term Acute-Care Hospitals thanks Congresswoman Sewell and Congressman Smith for introducing the LTCH Access and Stability Act,” said Anthony F. Misitano Chair of the Coalition of LTACHs and Founder, Chairman, & CEO of PAM Health. “This bill acknowledges the vital role LTACHs have played in the communities they serve during the most dangerous days of the COVID-19 pandemic and provides time for those hospitals to transition out of crisis mode and re-establish firm footing so they can continue to provide the long-term acute-level care for the patients who need it.”\\n“Members of the National Association of Long Term Hospitals (NALTH) have been proud to serve as front-line responders during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr. Ed Prettyman, President of the National Association of Long Term Hospitals. “We applaud Congresswoman Sewell and Congressman Smith for their leadership and the introduction of the LTCH Access and Stability Act. Ensuring long term care hospitals do not face an abrupt and steep payment cut is crucial to preserving access to vital care in communities across the country. We thank Congresswoman Sewell and Congressman Smith for recognizing the important role long term care hospitals play in caring for our nation’s most critically ill patients.”\\nThe LTCH Access and Stability Act is also supported by the following organizations:\\n\\nNorth Alabama Specialty Hospital\\xa0\\nAMG Specialty Hospitals\\xa0\\nCoalition of Long-Term Acute-Care Hospitals\\xa0\\nCommunity Hospital Corporation (CHC)\\xa0\\nKPC Promise Healthcare\\xa0\\nLandmark Hospitals\\xa0\\nLHC Group\\xa0\\nLifeCare 2.0\\xa0\\nNational Association of Long Term Hospitals (NALTH)\\xa0\\nPAM Health\\xa0\\nPriority Hospital Group\\xa0\\nVibra Health',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Vern Buchanan (FL-16) introduced H.R. 8581, the Preserving Access to Home Health Act of 2022. This bipartisan legislation would help preserve access to home health services for seniors and Americans with disabilities by preventing proposed cuts to home health payment rates from taking effect.\\n“The COVID-19 pandemic put a spotlight on the importance of home health services which are a lifeline for so many Alabama seniors and people with disabilities. It is imperative that we continue to protect home health services from cuts.” said Rep. Sewell. “The Preserving Access to Home Health Act is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that would do just that. I urge my colleagues to give it their full support.”\\xa0\\n“As we have learned from the coronavirus pandemic, home health services have proven to be invaluable for seniors in my district and across the country,” said Rep. Buchanan, lead Republican co-sponsor. “We know, when given the option, patients overwhelmingly prefer to receive care where they are most at ease—in the comfort of their own homes.”\\nHome health care allows over 3.5 million patients to be treated in the cost-effective setting they prefer most—their homes. Home health services are a lifeline for seniors, people with disabilities, and those with limited mobility, and have become even more essential during the COVID-19 public health emergency as we sought to keep our nation’s most vulnerable citizens safe.\\nUnfortunately, the delivery of home health services faces a serious threat due to a proposed policy that would\\xa0 make a permanent cut to home health care of 7.69 percent beginning in 2023, which totals $1.33 billion. It also proposes to “clawback” $2 billion in a temporary adjustment to home health payments for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries during the first two years of the COVID-19 public health emergency. Over a ten-year period, estimates indicate that these temporary and permanent adjustments could total $18 billion, which would decimate the Medicare home health program’s capacity to continue to care for the nation’s older Americans and people with disabilities.\\nThe Preserving Access to Home Health Act accomplishes a simple goal: it restricts the ability of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to impose these severe reductions for three years, until 2026, to enable the home health industry to continue to work with CMS on a fairer and more equitable budget neutrality methodology that is the underpinning for CMS’ reasoning behind these proposed reductions.\\xa0\\nThis legislation has been endorsed by the National Association of Homecare and Hospice, the Partnership for Quality Home Healthcare, and the Council of State Home Care Associations.\\nThe Preserving Access to Home Health Act can be found here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to invest in Alabama families and the American economy with government funding legislation for Fiscal Year 2023. This legislation will support our neighbors and families, create good-paying jobs, and protect Alabamians’ health and well-being. Within this package, Rep. Sewell secured millions in funding for local community projects in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. It will now make its way to the U.S. Senate.\\n“This government funding package invests in Alabama families and advances many of the priorities that Alabamians value most, creating good-paying jobs, improving our infrastructure, and bolstering our economy,” said Rep. Sewell. “I’m so proud to have helped secure millions of dollars in funding for local projects in our district! The funding for these projects responds directly to the needs of our communities, which is why I fought so hard for its inclusion. It is my hope that the Senate will swiftly approve this funding and send it to President Biden’s desk.”\\nRep. Sewell secured funding for the following local community projects in the FY2023 government funding which passed the House today:\\n\\n$4,000,000 for Blight Removal in Montgomery - The funding would be used to redevelop blighted properties within the City of Montgomery with the intention to revitalize neighborhoods that have historically seen a lack of investment opportunities.\\n$4,000,000 for the Selma Riverfront Multi-Plex - The funding would be used to acquire, redevelop and construct a center for essential public safety services accessible for all members of the community.\\n$4,000,000 for the Birmingham Valley Creek Rails to Trails Project - The funding would be used to redevelop and construct a 4.57-mile recreation and transportation project for low-income city residents.\\n$500,000 for the Town of Orrville Public Library - The funding would be used for the construction of a new municipal public library providing access to educational resources for a historically underserved community.\\n$750,000 for the Bethel Baptist Church Family and Child Center - The funding would be used to construct a multi-purpose community center providing child care and educational support for youth & families in a neighborhood that has experienced economic hardship and overall lack of investment for decades.\\n$1,500,000 for the Historic Brown Chapel AME Church Restoration - The funding would be used to stabilize the structure of the building to allow for further restoration of the sanctuary, bell towers, and brickwork. This much needed restoration is important because the church is a significant part of the Civil Rights movement story.\\n$6,800,000 for a F-35 Weapons Load Crew Training Facility at the Montgomery Regional Airport Base - The funding would be used to construct a Weapons Load Crew Training facility utilizing conventional design and construction methods to accommodate the mission of the facility. This arrangement will improve the ability to train weapons load crews and certify their continued readiness.\\n$15,000,000 for a Commercial Vehicle Inspection Gate at Maxwell Air Force Base - The funding would be used to construct a commercial vehicle inspection and entry control facility area. This project will provide perimeter protection and security of Air Force personnel and assets, prevent unauthorized access, and maximize traffic flow.\\n\\nAs a whole, this government funding package will secure critical investments in a range of key priorities for Alabama communities:\\n\\nCreating Good-Paying Jobs by upgrading Alabama’s roads, bridges, public transit, rail, airports and water infrastructure.\\nCombating the Climate Crisis by expanding renewable energy, strengthening local resilience against extreme weather and spurring new, innovative technology.\\nBolstering Alabama Health and Economic Security by investing in federal nutrition programs, Alabama small businesses, stronger consumer protection and expanded affordable housing.\\nHonoring our Service Members by investing in VA health care, military housing, child care for military families and mental health services.\\nStrengthening our Nation’s Food Supply by supporting Alabama farmers, expanding agricultural research and investing in land conservation.\\xa0\\n\\nInterior and Environment\\n\\n$171 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, including $28 million for competitive Grants to preserve the sites and stories of underrepresented communities, and $10 million for grants to HBCUs.\\n$65 million for ten new grant programs authorized in the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act, including $5 million for the new Decentralized Wastewater Grant Program.\\n$11.5 billion for the EPA, including $126 million to advance work related to PFAS, $5.18 billion for State and Tribal Assistance Grants, and $301 million for Environmental Justice.\\n\\nTransportation and Housing and Urban Development\\n\\n$62.7 billion for HUD, including an expansion of housing choice vouchers to more than 140,000 individuals and families experiencing or at risk of homelessness and 5,600 new units for seniors and persons with disabilities\\n$105.4 billion in budgetary resources for DOT, which will create and sustain tens of thousands of good-paying American jobs rebuilding our crumbling transportation infrastructure\\nMore than $2.6 billion to reduce emissions, increase resiliency, and address historical inequities in transportation and housing programs.\\xa0\\n\\nAgriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug Administration\\n\\n$560 billion for the expansion of broadband service\\n$30 billion in loan authority for the Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program\\nMore than $1.5 billion for rental assistance and affordable rental housing vouchers for low-income families and the elderly in rural communities\\n$111.2 billion in required mandatory spending for SNAP, including $3 billion for the SNAP reserve fund, which will serve more than 43.5 million people\\n$3.6 billion in discretionary funding to the FDA to combat the opioid crisis, stem food outbreaks, and address heavy metals in baby food\\n\\nEnergy and Water Development\\n\\n$4 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy\\n$350 million to advance technologies to increase resiliency, efficiency, and clean energy capabilities of the nation’s electricity delivery system\\n$100 million to accelerate domestic manufacturing of key clean energy technologies\\n$10.8 billion for the nation’s water infrastructure\\n\\nFinancial Services and General Government\\n\\n$326 billion for Entrepreneurial Development Programs at the Small Business Administration\\n$336 million for Community Development Financial Institutions, including $10 million to increase the availability and affordability of small dollar loans\\n$400 million for Election Security Grants to augment State efforts to improve the security and integrity of elections for Federal office\\n\\nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs\\n\\n$15.1 billion for military construction, including $274.4 million for Child Development Centers, $2.1 billion for Family Housing, and $135 million for Climate Change and Resiliency Projects\\n$135 billion in discretionary funds for VA, including $13.9 billion for mental health care, $911.1 million for Gender-specific Care and Programmatic Efforts for Women, and $2.7 billion for Homeless Assistance Programs.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to defend women’s access to reproductive health care in response to the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade and Republicans’ push for a nationwide abortion ban. The Women's Health Protection Act will ensure Americans’ right to make their own health decisions. The Ensuring Women's Right to Reproductive Freedom Act will reaffirm the right to freely travel throughout the country to access reproductive care.\\n“The Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade was devastating, reversing nearly 50 years of legal precedent and stripping away a woman’s right to make her own personal health care decisions,” said Rep. Sewell. “This ruling will put women’s lives on the line, especially here in Alabama where women die of pregnancy-related complications at one of the highest rates in the nation. I believe that a woman’s deeply personal health care decisions should be made by her and her doctor, not her politicians.”\\nWith its ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court erased nearly 50 years of legal precedent, fulfilling Republicans’ longtime goal of stripping Americans of their reproductive health freedoms. At least eight states implemented abortion bans the day of the Dobbs ruling, and lawmakers have begun implementing additional restrictions. Many are even seeking to impede Americans’ ability to access care across state lines and threatening to arrest doctors for providing care. Meanwhile, former Vice President Mike Pence and Republicans in Congress have called for a federal law outlawing abortion in all 50 states.\\nThese attacks threaten the health, lives, and well-being of women across the country and particularly in Alabama which already suffers from one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation. Health care providers are practicing in fear of criminal prosecution leading to the delay and denial of life-saving care. Women who have been denied an abortion face a range of harmful outcomes, including an increase in household poverty, a greater likelihood of staying in contact with a violent partner and heightened risk of maternal death.\\nIn response, the House again passed the Women's Health Protection Act to enshrine Roe v. Wade into federal law. Previously passed by the House last year, this landmark legislation has been updated to address the Dobbs ruling. The Women's Health Protection Act will uphold all Americans’ freedom to make their own health care decisions as well as providers’ freedom to provide lifesaving reproductive health care.\\xa0This bill would supersede state legislation, voiding all state-level bans throughout the country.\\nThe House also advanced the Ensuring Women's Right to Reproductive Freedom Act, addressing attempts to restrict Americans’ freedom of movement. This legislation will prohibit any attempt under state law to:\\n\\nimpede an individual from crossing state lines to obtain a legal abortion\\ninterfere with a health care provider’s ability to offer legal reproductive care\\nrestrict individuals from helping others to seek a legal abortion\\nobstruct the transportation of FDA-approved abortion medication.\\n\\nThis legislation now goes to the Senate for its consideration.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Thomasville, AL – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) continued her Congress in Your Community Tour in Thomasville, Alabama. Rep. Sewell began by visiting Thomasville’s Westervelt Lumber Mill where she toured the facility and spoke with employees during a town hall event. She then toured the Thomasville Regional Medical Center and met with the facility's leadership to help address their urgent funding needs.\\nAfter arriving at Westervelt Lumber’s Thomasville Mill, Rep. Sewell spoke with the facility's employees during a town hall event and provided an update on her bipartisan legislation, the Disaster Reforestation Act, which would help the lumber industry recover following a natural disaster. Sewell then toured the facility for a firsthand look at Westervelt’s work which serves customers across the United States.\\n“I know just how critical the timber industry is to Alabama’s 7th Congressional District and to the State of Alabama,” said Rep. Sewell. “I want to thank Westervelt Lumber for bringing jobs, opportunities, and investments right here to our Clarke County community.”\\xa0\\n“I also know companies like Westervelt face an immense financial burden when natural disasters damage our forests,” continued Sewell. “We must ensure that our tax code allows businesses to recover when disaster strikes, which is why I’m proud to be leading the bipartisan Disaster Reforestation Act in the House of Representatives. This bill would provide needed relief to this critical industry, allowing companies to claim losses of uncut timber from fire, storms, insects, invasive species, drought, or theft.”\\n“The Westervelt Company was pleased to welcome Congresswoman Sewell to our Thomasville Lumber facility today,” said Westervelt President and CEO Brian Luoma. “We appreciate her support on issues important to our industry, including the benefits of managed forests and the economic impact to our local communities.”\\nFollowing her stop at Westervelt Lumber, Sewell visited the Thomasville Regional Medical Center where she met with hospital officials about how she can best support efforts to keep the hospital open. For months, Rep. Sewell has been strongly advocating for critically-needed federal support to address the hospital’s urgent financial situation. During today’s visit, she reiterated her commitment to supporting the hospital which serves as a critical resource for those living in the Black Belt.\\n“The residents of Thomasville, Clarke County, and the Black Belt depend on the Thomasville Regional Medical Center for lifesaving care,” said Rep. Sewell. “I, along with Mayor Day, have been working tirelessly to find solutions that would address the hospital’s urgent financial needs. I want my constituents to know that I am committed to doing everything in my power to assist the Thomasville Regional Medical Center so that it can continue to serve this community.”\\n“We are fortunate to have Congresswoman Sewell on our team,” said Thomasville Mayor Sheldon Day. “She has been an integral part of our efforts to improve our community and to raise the level of health care throughout the Black Belt. Her assistance and leadership in attracting jobs to the area through companies such as Westervelt has been invaluable. We are grateful she spent time with us in Thomasville today.”\\nPhotos from today’s events can be found here.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – On Thursday, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) introduced H.R. 7755, the John Lewis Equality in Medicare and Medicaid Treatment (EMMT) Act, in the House of Representatives. This legislation would advance health equity and access to care for minority communities by requiring the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to work with experts to consider health disparities when developing payment models. Companion legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) on April 7.\\n“Our late colleague, Congressman John Lewis, knew that in order to achieve true justice, we must be intentional about increasing access to health care for communities of color,” said Rep. Sewell. “As co-chair of the Ways and Means Committee’s Racial Equity Initiative, I’m committed to advancing his legacy by bringing health equity to the forefront of our policy agenda. By ensuring that the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation considers the impact of new payment models on communities of color, the John Lewis Equality in Medicare and Medicaid Treatment Act will help us reduce racial disparities and build a fairer and more just health care system. I’m proud to join Senator Booker in introducing this bill and urge my colleagues to give it their full support.”\\n“The current health care system contains numerous disparities in health equity and access to care, a fact that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Sen. Booker. “My dear colleague John Lewis understood this and fought to make our health care system fairer. I am proud to continue this fight with this bicameral legislation that would make critical reforms to our health care system, helping our nation address health disparities and improve health outcomes, especially for underserved communities.”\\nEstablished by the Affordable Care Act, CMMI works to develop, test, and implement new value-based payment models. Under current law, however, CMMI is not required to consider social determinants of health—such as a patient’s environment, education, and economic status—when implementing and testing new payment models. The current status quo incentivizes health providers to pick patients who will produce favorable clinical outcomes, which leaves women, people in rural communities, and Black and Brown people sidelined in the development of payment models.\\xa0\\nThe John Lewis EMMT Act would direct CMMI to consult with experts on health disparities, such as the Office of Minority Health of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy, and the Office on Women’s Health, on developing new payment models that focus not only on lowering costs but also advancing health equity and improving access to care.\\nSpecifically, the John Lewis Equality in Medicare and Medicaid Treatment Act directs CMMI to:\\n\\nConsider a model’s impact on access to care for people of color, women, and people in rural areas, in addition to cost and quality.\\nInclude experts in health disparities and social determinants of health during the evaluation and review process for new payment models.\\nDirects CMMI to create a Social Determinants of Health Model that focuses on health conditions of those dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare, behavioral health, and maternal mortality.\\n\\n“Movement is Life applauds Representative Sewell for her leadership in addressing the disparities in healthcare that are hurting so many in our country,” said Mary O’Connor, MD and Chair of Movement is Life. “By addressing how payment models are created—with a focus on promoting health equity—this landmark legislation will help address the systemic racism and discrimination present in our healthcare system and support access for all to the high quality care we would each want for ourselves and our loved ones.”\\n“Congressman John Lewis worked tirelessly to ensure that Medicare supported every beneficiary, in every community,” said Barbara Petee, President of the Root Cause Coalition.\\xa0 “In rural or urban areas alike, we must come together, across sectors, to ensure care for those who are not as healthy or wealthy. The Root Cause Coalition applauds Representative Sewell for her ongoing leadership in health care.

This bipartisan bill would protect employees’ access to health care at their workplace health center by correcting a provision of the tax code that currently disincentivizes employers from offering worksite health clinics.\\n“Workers in Alabama and across this nation rely on their employer’s worksite health clinics to access critical health care services. These clinics make our communities healthier and offer countless benefits to companies and the workers they employ,” said Rep. Sewell.“We must ensure that our tax code rewards—not penalizes—employers for making these clinics available at the workplace. The Employee Access to Worksite Health Services Act is a commonsense bill that does just that. I’m proud to partner with Congressman Brad Wenstrup to introduce this bill and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give it their full support.”\\n“Our communities here in Ohio and across the country rely on worksite health clinics to provide valuable resources which keep people healthier longer by providing interventions and preventative healthcare,\" said Rep. Wenstrup, lead Republican sponsor. \"Our tax system currently disincentivizes employers from offering worksite health clinics, and this bill corrects that. I\\'m happy to work with Congresswoman Terri Sewell, Congressman Mike Kelly, and Congressman Earl Blumenauer on this important legislation and I hope my colleagues will do the same; let\\'s keep America\\'s employees healthy.\"\\nOffered by many large employers and state and local governments, worksite health clinics play a critical role in the health and well-being of employees across the nation, particularly those who face barriers to accessing care. In 2021, more than 60 percent of large companies offered worksite health clinics which provide preventive and primary care, wellness services, and care for those with chronic conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic only further clarified the essential nature of these clinics which offer COVID-19 testing, administer vaccines, manage return to work programs, and deploy telehealth services to monitor and treat employees remotely.\\nUnfortunately, a provision of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) currently disincentivizes employers from offering worksite health clinics. Under IRC Section 223, employees are prohibited from contributing pre-tax dollars to a Health Savings Account (HSA) if they also receive certain supplemental health benefits—like those provided at a worksite health clinic—at no cost or under fair market value. As a result, employers are forced to limit the scope of services offered to HSA enrollees or deny them access enjoyed by other employees and their family members. These limited options dissuade employers from offering worksite health clinics because it diminishes the health impact for their employee population and forces disparate treatment among employees.\\nThe Employee Access to Worksite Health Services Act would amend IRC Section 223 to clarify that accessing services provided through a worksite health clinic does not render an individual ineligible to make pretax contributions to their HSA. The bill would also broadly categorize the services worksite health clinics can provide to ensure compliance with IRS HSA requirements.\\nH.R. 7487 is cosponsored by Reps. Earl Blumenauer (OR-03) and Mike Kelly (PA-16). The bill can be found here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass H.R. 6833, the Affordable Insulin Now Act. This bill would cap out-of-pocket costs for insulin at no more than $35 per month in Medicare Part D and commercial health insurance, ensuring vital and affordable access to this life-saving medication for the more than 37 million people in the United States who have diabetes. The Affordable Insulin Now Act passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 232 to 193.\\n“Alabamians are being crushed by the astronomical cost of insulin which is forcing families across our state to choose between putting food on the table or purchasing this life-saving medication,” said Rep. Sewell. “This is unacceptable and it’s why I was proud to join my colleagues in voting to pass the Affordable Insulin Now Act to ensure that no Alabamian pays more than $35 dollars per month for insulin.”\\nInsulin is too expensive for millions of Americans, with 1 in 4 Americans who rely on insulin cutting back on or skipping doses due to costs. 34 percent of families with children dependent on insulin have been impacted by rising insulin costs, including adverse health effects and increased stress and anxiety. 26 percent of Americans with diabetes ration their insulin at least once a year—putting themselves at grave health risk because of cost. In 2018, more than a dozen people died while rationing their insulin due to the high cost. Insulin prices in the United States are much higher than other countries and continue to increase, with Americans paying more than 10 times the price of insulin compared to other similar high-income countries. From 2014 to 2019, the average retail price of insulin rose by 54 percent.\\nThe Affordable Insulin Now Act will have a real impact on millions of Americans. Beginning in 2023, the bill would require private health plans to cover at least one of each type and dosage form of insulin and would cap cost-sharing for a 30-day supply at the lesser of $35 or 25 percent of a plan’s negotiated price. The bill would also require all Medicare prescription drug plans to cap cost-sharing for insulin at no more than $35. Among individuals with private insurance, half would save at least $19 per month and a quarter would save at least $42 per month. Individuals who buy their own insurance will experience the most savings.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – This week, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined Rep. Adrian Smith (NE-03) to introduce the Critical Access Hospital Relief Act of 2022. This bipartisan bill would provide urgently needed support to Critical Access Hospitals—which provide essential services to residents in rural communities—by doing away with a burdensome and outdated payment rule that jeopardizes reimbursement.\\xa0\\n“Our rural hospitals have been on the front lines in the fight against COVID-19, providing lifesaving care to our most vulnerable and underserved communities,” said Rep. Sewell. “Tragically, many of these same hospitals have been struggling to keep their doors open, putting at risk the well-being of rural communities in Alabama’s 7th District and across this nation. With our bipartisan Critical Access Hospital Relief Act, we’re providing urgently needed relief so that hospitals can keep their doors open and focus on caring for their patients instead of complying with burdensome and outdated payment rules.”\\n“Health care providers have worked tirelessly over the last two years to treat patients during an unprecedented global pandemic,” said Rep. Smith, lead Republican sponsor. “The last thing hospitals need, especially facilities in rural areas that are already stretched thin, are burdensome regulations that take time away from patient care. My bipartisan bill would ensure Critical Access Hospital providers can take care of their patients without being forced to navigate a complicated and unnecessary maze of red tape.”\\nCritical Access Hospitals are small, remote facilities that provide 24-hour essential medical services to patients in rural communities, often serving primarily elderly and underserved populations. Critical Access Hospitals already face many unique challenges such as recruiting physicians, satisfying complicated administrative requirements with a smaller staff, and complying with numerous federal regulations not applied to larger hospitals.\\xa0\\nUnder current law, Critical Access Hospitals are required to certify at the time of admission that a patient on Medicare will not be admitted longer than 96 hours. Failure to certify could result in denial of reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), forcing patients to travel even further for care. This requirement adds one more unnecessary burden on rural facilities, providers, and the Medicare beneficiaries who already must travel long distances for treatment and may deter many patients from seeking necessary care. While this “96-hour rule” has been temporarily waived by CMS due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it could be reinstated at any point in the future, creating uncertainty for Critical Access Hospitals and the patients they serve.\\nThe Critical Access Hospital Relief Act repeals the 96-hour rule, alleviating a significant burden and allowing these hospitals to focus on caring for the patients they serve.\\n“Critical Access Hospitals play an essential, life-saving role in ensuring access to health care in rural communities,” said Lisa Kidder Hrobsky, Senior Vice President of the American Hospital Association. “We applaud Representatives Smith and Sewell for their leadership in working to remove an outdated and unnecessary payment rule that makes it harder to provide needed services for patients at these facilities.”',\n",

       "  'date': 'February 2, 2022',\n",
       "  'text': \"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined President Joe Biden at the White House as he announced the reigniting of the Cancer Moonshot, an initiative that he led as Vice President in 2016 to accelerate the rate of progress against cancer. Because of recent scientific advances and public health lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, the President announced a goal to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years and improve the experience of people and their families living with and surviving cancer — and, by doing this and more, end cancer as we know it today. Congresswoman Sewell was invited to join President Biden for today’s announcement because of her continued leadership in the House of Representatives in the fight against cancer, as the lead sponsor of H.R. 1946, the Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act.\\n“The fight against cancer is deeply personal for me as I know it is for President Biden and Americans of every background,” said Rep. Sewell. “I'm thrilled that the President set this ambitious goal and I'm excited to work with this Administration to end cancer as we know it! As the President noted, thanks to extraordinary scientific progress, we have more tools than ever before to prevent, detect, and diagnose cancer. That's why last year, I introduced my Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act to ensure that more Americans can access these life-saving technologies.”\\nCancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. However, detecting cancer early can result in less invasive treatments for patients and reduced costs associated with late-stage treatments. Fortunately, scientists are developing and testing innovative blood-based multi-cancer early detection tests that can screen for many cancers at the same time, including rare cancers. The companies engaged in multi-cancer screening have both received breakthrough device designation for their tests and are pursuing FDA approval. Unfortunately, under current law, it could take several years after FDA approval before Medicare beneficiaries could receive coverage for such tests.\\nRep. Sewell’s Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act, which she introduced in March 2021, would remove these barriers to access for FDA-approved multi-cancer early detection tests and greatly reduce the amount of time between FDA approval and Medicare coverage, ensuring that more Americans have access to these potentially life-saving technologies.\\nMore than 300 organizations across the country, led by the Prevent Cancer Foundation, and other high-profile leaders in the cancer advocacy community, shared a letter in support of the Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act. Local and national patient advocates, healthcare organizations, clinicians, and other stakeholders from all 50 states urged Congress to pass this critical legislation.\\nFor more information about the Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act, click here.\",\n",

       "  'date': 'January 26, 2022',\n",
       "  'text': 'Bessemer, AL – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) welcomed U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Deputy Secretary Jewel Bronaugh and Undersecretary for Rural Development Xochitl Torres Small to Medical West Hospital in Bessemer. The visit began with a roundtable where Sewell joined officials from the USDA, Jefferson County Commission, and UAB Medical West Hospital to discuss how they can collaborate to strengthen and expand access to health care for rural communities. Following their discussion, Deputy Secretary Bronaugh announced more than $1 billion in investments by the USDA that will transform rural areas across the country, including $360 million for the construction of the Medical West Hospital in Bessemer. This funding will increase access to health care, education, and public safety while spurring community development and building sound infrastructure for people living in rural communities.\\nBessemer’s Medical West Hospital Authority will use this $360 million Community Facilities Direct Loan, announced today, to build a state-of-the-art, 200-bed hospital. It will feature a 26-room emergency department, 12 operating rooms, eight labor and delivery rooms, and eight multi-purpose rooms. This 405,186- square-foot facility will be strategically located to serve rural west Jefferson County, rural west Tuscaloosa County and other surrounding rural communities. This project will benefit approximately 333,000 rural people in these communities.\\xa0\\n“I was so pleased to welcome USDA Deputy Secretary Bronaugh and Undersecretary Torres Small to Alabama today!” said Rep. Sewell. “I want to thank them and the rest of the Biden-Harris Administration for their commitment to Alabama’s 7th Congressional District and for bringing transformational investments like this right here to our doorstep. Thanks to this $360 million investment, the construction of Medical West Hospital in Bessemer will expand access to critical health care services for thousands of residents in Jefferson and Tuscaloosa Counties and the surrounding rural communities.”\\n“The Biden-Harris Administration has made investing in infrastructure improvements a top priority,” said Deputy Secretary Bronaugh. “These loans and grants will help rural communities invest in facilities and services that are vital to all communities, such as health care facilities, schools, libraries, and first responder vehicles and equipment. When we invest in essential services in rural America, we build opportunity and prosperity for the people who call rural communities home.”\\nThe construction of Medical West Hospital is one of 737 projects that USDA is helping fund through five programs to help rural America build back better, stronger and more equitably than ever before. These programs include Community Facilities Direct Loans and Grants, Community Facilities Loan Guarantees, Community Facilities Technical Assistance Training Grants, Community Facilities Disaster Grants, and Economic Impact Initiative Grants. The projects will finance emergency response vehicles and equipment; build or improve hospitals and clinics and help fund other essential community facilities. Bronaugh underscored the critical role that Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, Vice Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations, had in fighting for additional funding for the Community Facilities Direct Loans, which made many of these investments in critical rural infrastructure possible.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nUnder the Biden-Harris Administration, Rural Development provides loans and grants to help expand economic opportunities, create jobs and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans in rural areas. This assistance supports infrastructure improvements; business development; housing; community facilities such as schools, public safety and health care; and high-speed internet access in rural, Tribal and high-poverty areas.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07), a proud member of the Black Maternal Health Caucus, announced that her bill, the Maternal Vaccination Act, passed the House of Representatives by unanimous consent. The bill, which Rep. Sewell introduced in February, takes aim at the United States’ urgent maternal health crisis, providing critical funding to increase maternal vaccination rates and reduce vaccination disparities. The Maternal Vaccination Act was included in the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021.\\n“Today, the House took an important step in our fight to address the nation’s urgent maternal health crisis by passing my Maternal Vaccination Act!” said Rep. Sewell. “We know that the U.S. suffers from the highest pregnancy-related death rate in the developed world with Black women facing disproportionately high maternal mortality rates.”\\n“By providing funding to increase immunization rates for women and babies from communities with historically low vaccination rates, my Maternal Vaccination Act will help protect our mothers and babies from preventable diseases,” continued Sewell. “Passage of this bill brings us one step closer to ensuring that women of every background enjoy equal access to maternal health care.”\\n“Low vaccination rates put both mothers and babies at risk, so we must work to increase maternal vaccinations during this public health emergency and beyond. I was proud to see the House of Representatives pass Congresswoman Terri Sewell’s Maternal Vaccination Act with unanimous bipartisan support—it’s a crucial part of my Momnibus package that will protect moms and babies against vaccine-preventable diseases and save lives,” said Rep. Lauren Underwood (IL-14), Founder and Co-Chair of the Black Maternal Health Caucus. “I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this bill and other key priorities from the Momnibus and get them signed into law.”\\nThe Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021 will build on existing maternal health legislation, like policies to extend postpartum Medicaid coverage, with 12 bills to comprehensively address every dimension of America’s maternal health crisis.\\xa0\\nThe United States has the highest pregnancy-related death rate in the developed world. The maternal mortality rate is significantly higher among Black women, who are three to four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related complications. Other birthing people of color, including Hispanic, Native American, and Asian American and Pacific Islander women, also suffer from disproportionate rates of adverse maternal health outcomes.\\nThe Maternal Vaccination Act will provide funding for a public and provider awareness campaign to promote maternal and child vaccinations, including initiatives to:\\n\\nIncrease awareness about the safety, importance, and effectiveness of vaccines for pregnant and postpartum people and their children;\\nProvide targeted, evidence-based, culturally and linguistically appropriate resources about vaccines to pregnant and postpartum people, particularly in communities with historically low vaccination rates; and\\nProvide evidence-based information and resources on the safety and importance of maternal and child vaccinations to public health departments, maternal health care providers, and perinatal health workers.',\n",

       "  'date': 'November 18, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass President Biden’s historic Build Back Better Act, once-in-a-generation legislation to lower costs for hard-working Alabamians, cut taxes for families and workers, and build an economy that puts working families first. Notably, it will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 per year. Among its many provisions, the bill would close the Medicaid coverage gap, create good-paying jobs, lower child care and health care costs, create universal pre-K, establish paid family and medical leave, reduce housing costs, and make the largest investment in combating the climate crisis in American history. The bill passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 220-213 and will now make its way to the U.S. Senate.\\n“Within six weeks of President Biden taking office, we passed the American Rescue Plan to save our economy, crush the pandemic, and deliver critical relief to Americans everywhere,” said Rep. Sewell. “Just last week, we delivered the largest investment in our nation’s infrastructure in nearly a century. Now, with the passage of President Biden’s historic Build Back Better Act, House Democrats are delivering on our promise to build an economy that puts working families first!”\\n“For far too long, those at the very top have seen their fortunes grow while hard-working Americans have been squeezed,” continued Sewell. “Not anymore—I’m proud to report that the Build Back Better Act will uplift Alabama’s most underserved communities with transformational progress! The bill will provide affordable health insurance to Alabamians caught in the coverage gap, lower prescription drug costs, create universal pre-K, extend the Child Tax Credit, address the climate crisis and environmental injustice with bold action, and so much more. Together, President Biden and Congressional Democrats will continue to deliver historic progress for the American people!”\\nThe Build Back Better Act:\\nCreates Millions of Good-Paying Jobs - Together with the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Build Back Better Act will create an average of 2 million jobs per year over the course of the next decade.\\nCuts Taxes for Families and Workers - Prior to the pandemic, 16% of children under the age of 18 in Alabama lived in poverty. The Build Back Better Act will bolster financial security and spur economic growth in Alabama by reducing taxes on the middle class and those striving to break into it. The bill will extend Child Tax Credit (CTC) increases of $300/month per child under 6 or $250/month per child ages 6 to 17. This will continue the largest one-year reduction in child poverty in history. Critically, the agreement includes permanent refundability for the Child Tax Credit, meaning that the neediest families will continue to receive the full Child Tax Credit over the long-run. The bill will also provide a tax cut of up to $1,500 for 274,300 low-wage workers in Alabama by extending the American Rescue Plan’s Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) expansion.\\nCloses the Medicaid Coverage Gap and Provides the Largest Expansion of Affordable Health Care in a Decade - Because states like Alabama refuse to expand Medicaid, about 4 million Americans and nearly 300,000 Alabamians lack health insurance. The Build Back Better Act will close the Medicaid coverage gap by extending through 2025 the enhanced premium subsidies in the ACA Marketplace that were included in the American Rescue Plan. In doing so, it will ensure that every Alabamian and every American in the Medicaid coverage gap has access to affordable health insurance.\\nExpands Medicare with Hearing Coverage for Seniors - Beginning January 1, 2023, the bill allows for qualified audiologists to deliver aural rehabilitation and treatment services under Medicare, in addition to the hearing and balance assessment services provided under current law. It also allows for qualified hearing aid professionals to deliver hearing assessment services under Medicare. The bill also provides for coverage of hearing aids under Medicare Part B forindividuals with moderately severe, severe or profound loss in one or both ears.\\nLowers Prescription Drug Costs - The Build Back Better Act allows the Secretary of HHS to negotiate certain drug prices and halts price hikes above inflation for all Americans. It ensures that Americans with diabetes don’t pay more than $35 per month for their insulin. It also creates a new, out-of-pocket cap of $2,000 on what seniors pay for their drugs in Medicare Part D.\\nLowers Child Care Costs - Working families across Alabama are facing a child care crisis. The high cost of child care is straining family budgets and pushing millions of Alabamians out of the workforce – a majority of whom are women. The lack of affordable child care is also hurting our economy. As workers are forced to stay home, employers are struggling to fill job openings to meet demand and grow their businesses. The Build Back Better Act will dramatically lower the cost of child care for many families. Under the bill, the vast majority of families would not pay more than seven percent of their income on child care, representing an enormous savings from what they pay now. The bill invests a total $390 billion for the child care initiative and the universal preschool initiative. Under the bill, child care providers would also have resources to raise wages for child care workers and expand available supply to serve more children and families.\\nEstablishes Paid Family and Medical Leave - The United States lags behind the rest of the industrialized world when it comes to guaranteeing paid family and medical leave. Only 21 percent of American workers have access to employer-provided paid family leave, and just 42 percent of American workers have access to paid medical leave through an employer-provided plan. The Build Back Better Act establishes a universal and permanent family and medical leave program. The program provides four weeks of paid parental, family caregiving, and medical leave.\\nProvides Universal, High-Quality, Free Pre-K for Every 3- and 4-year old in America - Today, only 23% of 3- and 4-year-olds in Alabama have access to publicly funded preschool, and it costs about $8,600 per year for those who can’t access a publicly-funded program. The Build Back Better Act will enable Alabama to expand access to free, high-quality preschool to more than about 105,000 additional 3- and 4-year-olds per year and increase the quality of preschool for children who are already enrolled. Parents will be able to send their children to the preschool setting of their choice—from public schools to child care providers to Head Start—leading to lifelong educational benefits, allowing more parents to go back to work, and building a stronger foundation for Alabama’s future economic competitiveness.\\nInvests in HBCUs, TCUs and MSIs - The Build Back Better Act invests $3 billion in a competitive grant program to improve the research capacity and research and development infrastructure at four-year Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). The competitive grant program will consist of planning grants for a period of one to two years and implementation grants for a period of one to five years. The bill also invests $6 billion in institutional aid grants to HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, which can be used by these institutions to strengthen their academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities and award need-based financial aid to low-income students.\\nReduces Housing Costs and Expands Housing Options - 260,000 renters in Alabama are rent burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent, while homeownership remains out of reach for many families. The Build Back Better Act will expand rental assistance for Alabama renters, while also increasing the supply of high-quality housing through the construction and rehabilitation of over 1 million affordable housing units nationwide. It will address the capital needs of the entire public housing stock in America and it includes one of the largest investments in down payment assistance in history, enabling more first-generation homebuyers to purchase their first home.\\nMakes the Largest Effort to Combat Climate Change in American History - From 2010 to 2020, Alabama experienced 38 extreme weather events, costing up to $20 billion in damages. The Build Back Better Act is the largest effort to combat climate change in American history, investing $555 billion over 10 years in clean energy and climate investments. It contains green tax credits which will save the average American family hundreds of dollars per year in energy costs. It also Ensures clean energy technology – from wind turbine blades to solar panels to electric cars – will be built in the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of good jobs here at home.\\nFor a comprehensive breakdown of the Build Back Better Act, click here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) applauded the passage of H.R. 3755, the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA). Amid continued state-level assaults on Roe v. Wade and the right to choose, this legislation would ensure equal access to a full range of reproductive health care services for women across the country. Sewell was among the bill’s 176 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives. The bill passed the House today by a vote of 218-211.\\n“The protections secured in Roe v. Wade are on the line,” said Rep. Sewell. “I believe that a woman’s reproductive choices should be between her and her doctor, not between her, her doctor, and her elected officials. Women everywhere must have access to a full range of reproductive health care services, which is why I’m proud to support the Women’s Health Protection Act.”\\nWHPA guarantees a pregnant person’s right to an abortion—and the right of an abortion provider to deliver these abortion services—free from medically unnecessary restrictions that interfere with a patient’s individual choice or the provider-patient relationship.\\nFrom Roe v. Wade in 1973 to Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt in 2016, the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized abortion as a constitutional right. However, anti-abortion advocates have worked for years at the state-level to pass laws meant to undermine or eliminate access to abortion care. In the last decade, state lawmakers have pushed through nearly 500 restrictive laws that make abortion difficult and, sometimes, impossible to access. Just this year, four states have passed bans on abortion at six weeks of pregnancy, before many people even know they’re pregnant. Lawmakers in Arkansas and Oklahoma attempted to ban abortion completely. WHPA would stop these attacks and ensure that abortion care first guaranteed under Roe is a reality for everyone, everywhere.\\nWHPA can be found here.',\n",

Sewell. “With this bill, we are cutting taxes for middle class Americans and small businesses, expanding access to child care and healthcare, lowering prescription drug costs, and addressing the growing threat of climate change and environmental injustice. Its historic investments will uplift Alabamians who have been left behind and put us on a path to a more prosperous and equitable future.”\\nThe Ways and Means Committee’s portion of the Build Back Better Act includes measures to:\\n\\nExtend the extremely impactful American Rescue Plan expansion of the Child Tax Credit, and make permanent the American Rescue Plan expansions of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the child and dependent care tax credit;\\nProvide immediate coverage for Americans in the Medicaid coverage gap;\\nExtend the American Rescue Plan’s expanded premium tax credits to help lower health insurance costs;\\nExpanding Medicare coverage to include dental, vision, and hearing benefits, quickly getting new vision and hearing services to beneficiaries in 2022 and 2023, respectively, to eliminate cost and coverage barriers to this care;\\nLower prescription costs for Americans by allowing the HHS Secretary to negotiate for lower drug prices;\\nMitigate wealth inequality and strengthen the progressive power of our tax system by increasing the individual tax rate for high-earners, increasing the top capital gains rate, and adding a modest surtax on the highest-income taxpayers;\\nLevel the playing field by cutting taxes for our nation’s smallest businesses and bringing the corporate rate to 26.5 percent;\\nPromote global competitiveness while ensuring that multinational corporations pay their fair share by better harmonizing the U.S. corporate minimum tax rate with the rate agreed to by over 130 countries in international negotiations;\\nInvest in tax fairness by better equipping the IRS with updated technology and the human capital necessary for the complex audits of high-wealth individuals.\\nSupport clean energy investment and deployment and the creation of good, well-paying jobs;\\nReinstate Build America Bonds and advanced refunding bonds to provide financing to state and local governments and spur investment in the private sector; and\\nExpand proven tax credit programs that encourage economic and affordable housing investments in our communities that are most in need.\\n\\nExpand workplace supports by:\\n\\nProviding up to 12 weeks of universal paid family and medical leave for all U.S. workers;\\nReauthorizing the Health Profession Opportunity Grant (HPOG) program to strengthen this effective health care job training program and making it available nationwide; and\\nInvesting in child care access and equity by:\\n\\nEnsuring that parents and caregivers have the most useful and up-to-date information on available child care options and helping them easily apply for slots;\\nFunding the construction and remodeling of child care facilities to make them even safer and more aligned with public health guidelines; and\\nRaising the wages of child care workers, who currently earn a median wage of $12.24 per hour and often live in poverty.\\n\\n\\n\\nStrengthen retirement security by:\\n\\nRequiring employers without employer-sponsored retirement plans to automatically enroll their employees in IRAs or 401(k)-type plans; and\\nMaking the Saver’s Credit refundable so that those without any income tax liability are eligible to receive the benefit in the form of a contribution to their retirement account.\\n\\nProtect the elderly and people with disabilities in nursing homes by:\\n\\nFunding elder justice programs that increase support for state and local Adult Protective Services offices and long-term care ombudsman programs to better prevent elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation;\\nAddressing the staffing shortages in long-term care facilities by providing funds for recruitment and retention, including wage subsidies, access to child care, tuition reimbursement, and student loan replacement; and\\nImproving the accuracy and reliability of the data collected in these facilities to increase transparency for patients and their families, and strengthen the federal understanding of care quality and reimbursement, and study and update staffing – a key predictor of quality and safety.\\n\\nModernize and reform the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs by:\\n\\nIncreasing benefits and expanding eligibility to meet the needs of today’s workers under TAA for Workers program;\\nReestablishing the TAA for Communities program to target support and initiate proactive outreach in trade-affected communities;\\nDelivering additional funding to the TAA for Community Colleges and Career Training program to better support students served by community colleges;\\nExpanding eligibility, improving outreach, and increasing funding for TAA for Firms to assist firms facing competition from abroad; and\\nImproving outreach and increasing benefits for TAA for Farmers, which hasn’t received new funding in a decade.\\n\\nRep. Sewell secured the inclusion of several of her own bills in the Build Back Better Act including:\\n\\nRural Health Training Opportunities Act - Expands the health profession opportunity grant program that provides education and training to low-income individuals for high-demand occupations in the healthcare field.\\xa0\\nLocal Infrastructure Financing Tool (LIFT) Act - Provides a number of flexible financing tools that meet the unique needs of communities across the country, including transportation, public health facilities, schools, and other infrastructure and economic development projects. It will restore the ability of states and localities to refinance existing debt through advance refunding, a tool that Republicans gutted in their 2017 tax bill.\\nNew Markets Tax Credit Extension Act – This bill will once and for all make the successful New Markets Tax program permanent. The proposal provides:\\n\\nAn additional $2 billion (for a total of $7 billion) in 2022\\n$1 billion (for a total of $6 billion) in 2023.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom then forward, it sets the allocation amounts at $5 billion for 2024 and all years thereafter.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Rep. Sewell Introduces Bipartisan Legislation to Preserve Patient Access to Home Infusion Services',\n",
       "  'date': 'August 23, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington D.C.\\xa0 – U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined Reps. Fred Upton (R-MI), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), and Vern Buchanan (R-FL) in introducing H.R. 5067, the Preserving Patient Access to Home Infusion Act. This bipartisan bill would ensure patients with serious viral and fungal infections, heart failure, immune diseases, cancer, and other conditions receive the intravenous (IV) medications they need while at home.\\n“Countless Alabamians, especially those in rural communities, rely on home infusion services for life-saving care,” said Rep. Sewell. “With the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, it has never been more critical to ensure that patients continue to receive this care safely in their homes. I’m so proud to introduce this bipartisan bill and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give it their full support.”\\n“While the COVID-19 pandemic certainly took so much from so many, it also gave us the opportunity to rethink the way that we care for the most vulnerable among us,” said Rep. Upton, lead Republican co-sponsor. “Home infusion, in particular, is a perfect example of how we can bring healthcare services into folks’ homes while keeping both patients, their families, and medical professionals safe and healthy. I am proud to cosponsor this important legislation and will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to expand access to quality, affordable healthcare.”\\xa0\\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of access to quality, affordable health care – especially in home health care,” said Rep. Dingell, lead Democratic co-sponsor. “The legislation’s commonsense reforms will expand access to home infusion services for Medicare beneficiaries, saving the Medicare program millions of dollars, cutting patient costs, and ensuring people receive safe and adequate care in the comfort of their own home. I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this bipartisan legislation forward so we can effectively care for people and save money by doing so in a home setting.”\\n“As we have learned from the coronavirus pandemic, home health services have proven to be invaluable for seniors in my district and across the country,” said Rep. Buchanan, lead Republican co-sponsor. “The aptly-named Preserving Patient Access to Home Infusion Act will ensure that Medicare recipients are able to continue to receive life-saving drugs in a safe and effective way from the comfort of their own home.”\\nBackground\\nPatients with serious infections, cancer, heart failure, immune system diseases, and other conditions who need medications such as IV therapies, can receive these medications in their home rather than institutional settings like hospitals or nursing homes. When given the option, patients would overwhelmingly prefer to receive their infused drugs at home where they are most comfortable and can resume their personal and professional lives. In fact, research shows that up to 95% of patients would prefer receiving their infusions at home.\\xa0\\nCongress included provisions in the 21st Century Cures Act and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 to create a professional services benefit for Medicare Part B home infusion drugs. The purpose of this benefit was to maintain patient access to home infusion by covering professional services including assessments, education on administration and access device care, monitoring and remote monitoring, coordination with the patient, caregivers and other health care providers, and nursing visits.\\nDespite Congress’ intent—as detailed in multiple letters to the agency—the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) improperly implemented the benefit by requiring a nurse to be physically present in the patient’s home in order for providers to be reimbursed. As a practical matter, the current home infusion therapy benefit only acknowledges face-to-face visits from a nurse and fails to account for the extensive clinical and administrative services that are provided remotely by home infusion clinicians. As a result, provider participation in Medicare’s home infusion benefit has dropped sharply and beneficiaries have experienced reduced access to home infusion over the last several years.\\nThe Preserving Patient Access to Home Infusion Act provides technical clarifications that will remove the physical presence requirement, ensuring payment regardless of whether a health care professional is present in the patient’s home. The legislation also acknowledges the full scope of professional services provided in home infusion—including essential pharmacist services—into the reimbursement structure.\\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has consistently concluded that enhanced patient access to home infusion will create savings for the Medicare program. An analysis from The Moran Company estimates that the bill would save $93 million over 10 years. Cost savings generated through site of care optimization are passed on to the patient in the form of lower copays and reduced out-of-pocket costs. This is especially important in Medicare Part B, where patients pay 20% coinsurance.\\xa0\\n“Home-based infusion services stand out as high-value resources that improve patient quality of life and add capacity to the health care system while providing cost-savings for the Medicare program,” said NHIA President and CEO Connie Sullivan, BSPharm. “Passage of the Preserving Patient Access to Home Infusion Act is critical to ensuring the Medicare program maintains access to home infusion, allowing beneficiaries to safely receive treatment in the setting they overwhelmingly prefer: their homes.”\\n“Providing IV medications in patients’ homes allows individuals to receive their treatments without major sacrifices in their quality of life and without having to rely on transportation to travel to a facility for their treatments,” said Logan Davis, PharmD, MBA of Vital Care InfusionServices. “This legislation will ensure that the Medicare home infusion therapy benefit is accessible to patients, including many who are located in Alabama’s rural or historically underserved communities.”\\nCompanion legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA) and Tim Scott (R-SC).',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C.\\xa0– This week, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass nine of House Democrats’ Fiscal Year 2022 spending bills to fund the federal government through 2022 and make historic investments in working families, infrastructure, health care, education, and our veterans.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C.\\xa0– Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that she secured the inclusion of over $7.8 million for eight community projects in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District in House Democrats’ FY2022 government funding bills. With the passage of these bills in the House of Representatives this week, funding for these community projects has cleared a key hurdle. The bills must now face negotiations in the Senate.\\n“I fought hard to secure funding for community projects in Alabama’s 7th District in the 2022 government funding bills, and I am beyond thrilled to announce that over $7.8 million was included for projects in our district,” said Rep. Sewell. “By including funding for these projects, House Democrats are bypassing bureaucracy and getting money directly into the community where it’s needed. I am hopeful that the Senate will swiftly approve this funding and I look forward to seeing President Biden sign it into law.”\\nIn April, Rep. Sewell submitted requests to the House Appropriations Committee to fund\\xa0community projects\\xa0in Alabama’s 7th District. Funding for eight of these projects, totaling\\xa0$7,829,355, was included in House Democrats’ appropriations package that passed in the House this week. The bills will now make their way to the Senate where they will face additional negotiations before being passed and signed into law by President Biden. Rep. Sewell looks forward to her other community project funding requests being included in Appropriations bills still pending before the House of Representatives.\\nRep. Sewell secured funding, totaling $7,829,355.00, for the following community projects in the House’s government funding bills:\\n*NOTE: Funding for these projects must still be passed by the Senate.\\n\\nJefferson County - Greater Shiloh Baptist Church - Employment and Training Project\\n\\nRecipient: Cornerstone Revitalization Foundation, Inc.\\nAward: $1,500,000.00\\nProject: To reduce recidivism, CWD will afford adults ages 25 and older opportunities to learn trade and technical skills.

       "  'text': 'Washington D.C.\\xa0 – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that she will be an original co-sponsor of the Medicaid Saves Lives Act, legislation that would create a federal Medicaid-style program for those living in states like Alabama that have refused to expand Medicaid. The bill, led by Reps. Kathy Manning (D-NC-6), Kathy Castor (D-FL-14), Nikema Williams (D-GA-5), Lucy McBath (D-GA-6), Marc Veasey (D-TX-33), Gwen Moore (D-WI-04) and Deborah Ross (D-NC-2), was introduced today.\\n“Improving access to quality, affordable health care continues to be one of my top priorities in Congress,” said Rep. Sewell. “Because of the State of Alabama’s refusal to expand Medicaid, at least 300,000 low-income Alabamians who would otherwise qualify for health insurance coverage are being forced to go without care, putting their health and their lives at risk.”\\xa0\\n“This is simply unacceptable,” continued Sewell. “That’s why I’m proud to be co-sponsoring the Medicaid Saves Lives Act which would create a Medicaid-like program to cover hard-working Americans in states like Alabama that are putting politics above the lives of our people. This bill would help thousands of Alabamians see a doctor, obtain medications, and afford life-saving care.”\\nWhile the American Rescue Plan Act offered the 12 states—including Alabama—that did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act robust financial incentives to do so, it has become increasingly clear that many of these states do not plan to expand. This means 4.4 million low-income Americans will continue to be denied health coverage as communities across the nation are still working hard to recover. Americans who are most harmed by this inaction from state leaders are people of color: 60% of people in the coverage gap are Black, Hispanic, Asian, or Pacific Islander.\\nThe Medicaid Saves Lives Act would address the coverage gap by creating a federal Medicaid look-alike program that is run and administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), providing the same full benefits of Medicaid. It would also add to the incentives in the American Rescue Plan Act by giving states additional and extended funding to expand Medicaid through a significant federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) increase. Since Congress already paid for Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act, the federal Medicaid program in the Medicaid Saves Lives Act has already been funded once and should require no additional offsets.\\nCongress must pass the Medicaid Saves Lives Act to right away because this legislation would:\\n\\nIncrease free and affordable health coverage to millions of Americans;\\nExpand access to health care and provide access to preventative health services;\\nImprove health outcomes and prevent premature deaths;\\nReduce uncompensated care costs which would reduce the number of hospital and provider closures; and\\nImprove economic mobility that would enable low-income individuals to work.\\n\\nThis program created in the Medicaid Saves Lives Act would also include the robust Medicaid benefits provided under the Affordable Care Act such as:\\n\\nAll essential health benefits;\\nNon-emergency medical transportation;\\nPrescription drug benefits;\\nCoverage for rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers;\\nPreventative services;\\nMaternity and newborn care;\\nMental health and substance use disorder care; and\\nHospitalization services.\\n\\nCompanion legislation was introduced in the Senate by Sens.

The same should be true for women receiving care through the VA who have honorably served our Nation. I was proud to cast my vote for the Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act to eliminate this disparity and ensure that all women have equal access to the critical health care services they need.”\\nBackground:\\nThere are currently 20 million women veterans in the United States who comprise the fastest growing group of veterans enrolling in health care through the Veterans Health Administration (VA). Sadly, many of their health needs go unaddressed in a VA system that has not evolved to equitably serve a changing population.\\xa0\\nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, basic contraceptive services are available without a co-pay to all women with civilian health insurance. Active-duty service members enjoy access to no-cost contraception through TRICARE. However, women veterans are routinely charged co-pays to access contraception through the VA, placing an unfair burden on women who have served our nation honorably.\\nThe Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act eliminates this disparity by prohibiting the Department of Veterans Affairs from requiring payment from a veteran for any contraceptive item that is required to be covered by health insurance plans without a cost-sharing requirement.\\nThe Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act can be found here.',\n",

This bipartisan legislation would improve research and treatment for chronic kidney disease and kidney failure by increasing awareness and education, improving payments systems, incentivizing innovation, and expanding patient choices.\\n“Tens of millions of Americans are impacted by kidney disease,” said Rep. Sewell. “For too many Alabamians, its negative health effects are accompanied by financial challenges and barriers to receiving care. Increasing access to quality, affordable health care continues to be one of my top priorities in Congress, and I’m so proud to introduce the Chronic Kidney Disease Improvement in Research and Treatment Act. This legislation will make critical improvements to the way patients with kidney disease, especially those in underserved communities, access and receive care.”\\n“Tragically, kidney disease affects more than one in 10 Americans, many of whom have trouble accessing quality care,” said Rep. Buchanan, lead Republican co-sponsor. “This important legislation incentivizes innovative new treatments for kidney disease, expands access to dialysis and transplants in underserved communities and ultimately improves the quality of life for those living with these chronic conditions.”\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that as many as 15% of U.S. adults – approximately 37 million people – suffer from Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Of those with CKD, as many as 9 in 10 are undiagnosed. As the disease progresses and kidney function worsens, patients risk developing kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). According to the CDC, in the year 2018 alone, treating Medicare beneficiaries with CKD cost over $81.8 billion and treating people with ESRD cost an additional $36.6 billion. Kidney diseases are the ninth leading cause of death in the United States.\\nThe Chronic Kidney Disease Improvement in Research and Treatment Act would:\\n\\n\\nIncrease Kidney Disease Awareness and Education\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe bill would increase detection of kidney disease by expanding the Medicare Annual Wellness Benefit to include kidney disease screening.\\n\\n\\nIt would also increase access to the Medicare Kidney Disease Education Benefit by allowing dialysis facilities to provide kidney disease education services and permit physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and clinical nurse specialists, in addition to physicians, to serve as referral sources for the benefit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate an Economically Stable Dialysis Infrastructure and Incentivize Innovation\\n\\n\\nThe bill would make important changes to the ESRD payment system to improve accuracy in payment and support innovative therapies.\\n\\n\\nIt would incentivize innovation by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to adjust the ESRD Prospective Payment System bundled rate when the current rate would not cover the cost of adding a new drug, biologic, device, or other technology into the bundle after the transitional payment period ends.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImprove the Accuracy and Transparency of ESRD Quality Programs\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe bill would reform how the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) adopts measures used in the ESRD Quality Incentive Program (QIP) to ensure there are a set of meaningful, valid, and reliable measures.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIt would establish QIP bonus payments for facilities exceeding the attainment performance standards.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIt would also improve patient decision-making by eliminating contradictions between the ESRD QIP and Five Star programs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExpand Patient Choice of Coverage\\n\\n\\nThe bill would guarantee access to Medigap policies to all ESRD Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of age.\\n\\n\\nIt would allow patients with ESRD to retain private insurance as their primary payer for an additional 12 months.\\n\\n\\nThe bill would protect patient access to Medicare Advantage plans by requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to reinstate dialysis services as an area subject to the Network Adequacy requirements.',\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Drew Ferguson (GA-03)\\xa0introduced the Save Rural Hospitals Act of 2021.\\xa0This legislation would help curb the trend of hospital closures in rural communities by ensuring fairness in Medicare hospital payments through reimbursements from the federal government. As a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency, rural hospitals continue to lose revenue despite playing an essential role in serving their communities and providing lifesaving care during the largest public health crisis in a century.\\xa0\\n“As we continuously work to rebuild after the devastation of the past year, it is critically important that we acknowledge the lasting impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on rural hospitals across this nation,”\\xa0said Rep.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, rural hospital closures accelerated to record levels with more than\\xa020 rural hospitals\\xa0closing in 2020. Low patient volumes and significant financial strain are often the primary factors in these closures and are compounded by the flawed Medicare Area Wage Index that results in rural hospitals receiving disproportionately low reimbursement rates.\\xa0\\nThis legislation would establish an appropriate national minimum (0.85) for the Medicare Area Wage Index to ensure that rural hospitals receive their payment for the care they provide, while preserving the existing reimbursements for urban hospitals.

Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), authorizes the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to work directly with counties, cities, and other political subdivisions to expand Medicaid coverage. It would, for the first time, allow local leaders to help their vulnerable residents in states which have declined to accept federal resources for Medicaid expansion.\\n“Improving access to quality, affordable health care is one of my top priorities in Congress,”\\xa0said Rep.

That’s why I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing the COVER Now Act which would help thousands of Alabamians see a doctor, obtain medications, and afford life-saving care.”\\nKey Features of the COVER Now Act:\\xa0\\n\\nThe bill would authorize CMS to contract directly with counties and other political subdivisions to establish demonstration projects expanding Medicaid coverage to their residents.\\nParticipating entities will receive the same deal previously made available to states: 100% federal funding for the first 3 years and a gradual reduction to 90% federal funding by year 7 and thereafter.\\nParticipating entities may apply individually or jointly if they wish to establish a regional expansion project.\\nExisting Medicaid rules and systems would remain in place and apply to the local expansion programs.\\nStates would be required to cooperate and authorize access to State Medicaid systems for participating entities, with additional federal administrative Medicaid funding for cooperation and subject to federal penalties for non-cooperation.\\nShould a state expand, eligible beneficiaries enrolled in a local expansion program would be automatically enrolled into the State Medicaid program.\\n\\nThe COVER Now Act is based on previous successful demonstration projects in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Cook County, Illinois, and several counties in California. These demonstration projects were established by state application through 1115 waivers and served as the glidepath to statewide expansion. Under the COVER Now Act, local entities would be empowered to apply directly to CMS without the state’s involvement.\\n\"Millions of people have gained access to health care, thanks to the Affordable Care Act,”\\xa0said Debra L. Ness, President, National Partnership for Women & Families.\\xa0“But despite these advancements there are still 2.2 million people who have been shut out due in large part to 12 states refusing to expand Medicaid. The majority of those impacted are people of color. In order to fix this, the American Rescue Plan provided a sizable financial incentive to states to finally take up Medicaid expansion. Still, these states – many with a deep legacy of racism and racist health policies – will likely continue to refuse these incentives at great detriment to the health outcomes, lives, and maternal health of their residents. The National Partnership commends these members for working to find ways to address the coverage gap in states that have not expanded Medicaid coverage, and we urge Congress to work towards a solution.”\\xa0\\n“The American Diabetes Association strongly supports the COVER Now Act to expand access to Medicaid coverage for uninsured and under-insured Americans, especially the 122 million people living with diabetes and prediabetes,” said\\xa0Tracey Brown, CEO of the American Diabetes Association.\\xa0“Health insurance coverage through Medicaid can empower individuals and families to be more proactive in seeking preventive care, early diagnosis and diabetes management through affordable prescription drugs and devices. Health care costs for the diabetes community are 2.5 times higher than those for Americans without diabetes, and the COVER Now Act is an important step toward addressing cost barriers to life-saving health care.\\xa0\\nThe COVER Now Act is also supported by UnidosUS, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and CommuniCare Health Centers.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. –\\xa0This Congress, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Gus Bilirakis (FL-12), introduced H.R. 3258, the Timely Access to Cancer Treatment (TACT) Act of 2021. This legislation would require that patients with cancer be provided their oral cancer drugs within an acceptable time frame.\\n“Undergoing treatment for cancer is difficult enough. No patient should also have to worry about delays in receiving potentially life-saving medication,”\\xa0said Rep. Sewell.\\xa0“The TACT Act is a simple, commonsense solution that would remove unnecessary roadblocks and empower doctors to get their patients the critical care that they need in a timely manner. I am proud to introduce this bill and urge my colleagues to support it.”\\n“This bill is about removing the red tape within our healthcare system and ensuring that cancer patients have timely access to their medications,”\\xa0said Rep. Gus Bilirakis, lead Republican co-sponsor. “Doctors, not bureaucrats, best understand the needs of their patients and should be empowered with the tools needed to provide the best possible care—especially when time is of the essence.”\\nBackground on the TACT Act\\nPatients’ access to the appropriate cancer treatment within a reasonable time frame is increasingly challenged by our complex health care delivery system. This is especially true for oral cancer drugs. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), health insurance plan sponsors, and specialty and mail order pharmacies are notorious for slowing down the process by which patients receive their oral cancer drugs, even in cases where an oncology practice can provide those drugs at the site of care via an in-house pharmacy or dispensing facility. In some cases, PBMs etc. even disallow the drugs prescribed.\\nThe TACT Act provides a simple solution by requiring that patients be provided their oral cancer drugs within an acceptable time frame of 72 hours, allowing for situations – such as acquiring financial support – that are understandable and acceptable.\\nSpecifically, the bill will:\\xa0\\n\\nRequire PBMs, plan sponsors, insurers, and pharmacies, including specialty and mail order pharmacies, to ensure that a cancer patient is able to receive his or her prescription medication within 72 hours of having the prescription submitted to the patient’s pharmacy benefit plan provider in order to ensure that there is not undo delay in the initiation of the patient’s cancer treatment;\\nAllow patients who are not able to receive their prescription from a pharmacy benefit plan provider within 72 hours to seek pharmacy services and receive their prescription medication from any other duly-licensed entity that can fill the patient’s prescription and require that it be covered under the patient’s plan with full use of the patient’s applicable benefit(s);\\nRequire pharmacy benefit plan providers receiving the prescription to confirm within 24 hours to the patient’s prescriber receipt of the prescription and the ability to fill it within the 72-hour period; and\\nRequire that any prior authorization required by the pharmacy benefit plan provider take place in such a time that the 72-hour time limit is not exceeded.\\n\\n“Patients facing cancer must be able to receive the medications their doctors prescribe in a timely manner, without unnecessary delays by PBMs. The TACT Act of 2021 helps overcome the tremendous barriers to patient care that oncologists have, unfortunately, become all too familiar with,”\\xa0said Kashyap Patel, M.D., President of the Community Oncology Alliance (COA) and a practicing medical oncologist at Carolina Blood and Cancer Care in Rock Hill, South Carolina. “Cancer is deadly and can evolve quickly. Patients have enough on their hands dealing with the disease without fighting middlemen to get their drugs. Thanks to Congresswoman Sewell for her leadership along with Congressman Bilirakis in introducing a bipartisan bill that empowers patients with cancer. I hope others in Congress will join them in supporting this important legislation.”\\nThe TACT Act can be found\\xa0here.',\n",

       "  'date': 'May 5, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. -\\xa0This Congress, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07), along with Reps. Devin Nunes (CA-22), Peter Welch (VT-AL), and Markwayne Mullin (OK-02), introduced H.R. 2454, the Protecting Access to Ground Ambulance Medical Services Act of 2021. The bill would ensure that ambulance service providers, including rural providers and those in underserved communities, are able to continue delivering quality critical first responder and health care services.\\n“When tragedy strikes and medical emergencies happen, we should feel confident that our first responders have the resources they need to deliver life-saving care,”\\xa0said Rep. Sewell. “Unfortunately, inadequate Medicare reimbursement rates are putting a strain on ambulance service providers in the most vulnerable communities across the country and making it harder for them to care for our neighbors.”\\xa0\\n“The problem is particularly severe for rural communities and has been worsened by the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic,”\\xa0continued Sewell. “That is why I am proud to introduce the Protecting Access to Ground Ambulance Medical Services Act of 2021. This bill would permanently adjust Medicare reimbursement practices so that vital ambulance services remain vibrant and available to all Americans.”\\n“This bipartisan bill includes key reforms to ensure that rural Americans are not harmed by the delay in updating the Medicare ground ambulance fee schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic,”\\xa0said Rep. Nunes, Lead Republican Co-Sponsor.\\xa0“Extending these temporary Medicare ground ambulance add-on payments for another five years and expanding coverage for those who live in zip codes with fewer than 1,000 people per square mile will keep ambulance costs affordable for Americans when they need ground ambulance transportation.”\\n“Rural ambulance services save lives and provide needed care in underserved areas every day,”\\xa0said Rep. Peter Welch, Lead Democratic Co-Sponsor.\\xa0“This bipartisan bill will ensure that patients in rural areas have access to critical ambulance services and that the providers of these services receive fair, consistent reimbursement for their important work. It’s time for Congress to pass this bill and give ambulance services the certainty they need to continue serving all Americans.”\\n“Ambulance services are critically important to rural Americans who may live close to an hour away from the nearest emergency room,”\\xa0said\\xa0Rep. Mullin, Lead Republican Co-Sponsor.\\xa0“Providing this care literally means the difference between life and death for many people. As we continue to battle the closures of critical access hospitals across Oklahoma, ambulance services are more important now than ever before. We must ensure that rural Americans receive the care they need. I’m proud to join my colleagues in support of this bill which would enhance and increase resources for first responders in Oklahoma.”\\nCurrently, ambulance service providers across the country are reimbursed by Medicare at rates\\xa0below\\xa0the cost of providing services, as determined by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Consequently, providers rely on “add-on” payments to continue providing services. Add-on payments vary depending on whether a provider is located in an urban, rural, or “super rural” ZIP Code.\\nCongress has extended current add-on payment rates through December 31, 2022, and planned to review Medicare cost data in considering whether they should be made permanent. However, due to the upcoming ZIP Code reclassification which will occur following the 2020 Census, providers are faced with uncertainty regarding the future of these payments. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to delay the first two rounds of data collection, compounding this uncertainty.\\nBackground on the\\xa0Protecting Access to Ground Ambulance Medical Services Act of 2021\\nH.R. 2454, the Protecting Access to Ground Ambulance Medical Services Act of 2021, would end the band-aid approach and make permanent adjustments to the reimbursement methodology for services in urban, rural, and \"super rural\" areas by building the temporary add-ons into the base rate fee. Specifically, it would extend the current temporary Medicare ground ambulance increases of 2% urban, 3% rural, and the super rural bonus payments for five years and would ensure that rural zip codes continue to be classified as rural following the ZIP Code reclassification.\\xa0\\nThese payments are vital to the financial viability of the ambulance community and have been extended numerous times on a bipartisan basis, most recently for 5 years. This five-year extension would allow a new data cost collection system time to be put into place and collect meaningful data following the delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n“NRHA applauds Representative Terri Sewell for her leadership in working to preserve ground ambulance services in rural America. Throughout the pandemic ambulance services have provided critical first responder services in our most rural communities. Passing H.R. 2454,\\xa0the\\xa0Protecting Access to Ground Ambulance Medical Services Act of 2021, is critical to ensuring that these important services remain in their communities long after the public health emergency,”\\xa0said Alan Morgan, Chief Executive Officer of the National Rural Health Association.\\n\"The Alabama Rural Health Association lends its full support behind the \\'Protecting Access to Ground Ambulance Medical Services Act of 2021\\' (H.R. 2454).\\xa0 As rural EMS transportation is one of the greatest challenges for quality access to care in rural Alabama, support is greatly needed to reinforce the existing emergency transportation system.\\xa0 With additional funding and flexibility created in the system, states like Alabama will have the ability to provide improved emergency transportation in critically rural and underserved areas and allow patients to receive the care that they need in a timely manner.\\xa0 We are thankful for Rep. Sewell’s introduction of this language, and we encourage support for H.R. 2454,”\\xa0said Ryan Kelly, Administrator of the Alabama Rural Health Association.\\xa0\\nThe legislation is also supported by the following organizations:\\n\\nAmerican Ambulance Association (AAA)\\nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC)\\nInternational Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF)\\nNational Association of Emergency Medical Technicians (NAEMT)\\nNational Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC)\\n\\nH.R. 2454 can be found\\xa0here.',\n",

       "  'date': 'April 8, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': 'Birmingham, AL - Today, Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) welcomed First Lady of the United States Dr. Jill Biden to Birmingham to highlight the historic reduction in child poverty that will be achieved thanks to the American Rescue Plan. Rep. Sewell played a critical role in drafting the expansions of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan, which are projected to cut child poverty in the United States by more than a half.\\xa0\\nRep. Terri Sewell: Good afternoon Birmingham! What a great day to welcome Dr. Jill Biden, the First Lady of the United States, to our wonderful city of Birmingham.\\xa0\\nAs the only member of the Alabama Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of the 1.9 trillion dollar American Rescue Plan, here’s what I know for a fact: the people that I represent need assistance to get through COVID-19. I heard from them, and I know that they need money to be able to afford food on their tables and resources to make sure that they are equitably receiving the vaccine.\\xa0\\nThank God that because of the American Rescue Plan, 1.9 trillion dollars were able to put shots in arms and in record time. You know the Biden-Harris Administration said that they were going to do 100 million shots in arms by the first 100 days. We were able to do it in 58 days! We also know that we needed direct funds to our state but also to our counties and our cities. I heard you Mr. Mayor and all of our mayors across the 7th Congressional District when they said they wanted direct resources and I am proud to announce that help is here!\\nToday I am thrilled to talk about another aspect of the American Rescue Plan. We knew that it was critically important that we help families, the whole family. We knew how important it was to help our children so the second round of $600 that went out in December, as well as the $1400 that went out just 2 weeks ago, include resources not just for the adults in the family, but for the children in the family as well. Through this plan, a family of 4 would receive not just the $1,400 for mom and dad, but for their children as well. That’s $5600 for an average family of four.\\xa0\\nToday I am proud to be right here at the YWCA and I want to thank LaRhonda and all of your staff for hosting us today. We started off at the James Rushton Early Learning Center at Woodlawn and I want to thank them and the Woodlawn Foundation for allowing us to see firsthand how our children are not only learning but they are thriving even in the midst of this pandemic. And that’s what it’s about.\\xa0\\nUnder the leadership of LaRohanda and so many others, the YWCA of Central Alabama has had a profound impact on countless families and children in our region. As I said earlier today, we were at the Woodlawn Foundation’s James Rushton Early Learning Center, where we toured a classroom and met with children who are benefiting every day from this institution. For years they have dedicated themselves to revitalizing the community of Woodlawn and they are doing it. They’re not just talking about it—they are about it!\\nAlso, I am thrilled to be with Alabama Child Advocate Liz Huntley who will introduce Dr. Biden in a minute. She is among the countless local leaders that are present here today as we talk about child poverty and the fact that the American Rescue Plan deals will deal with that directly.\\xa0\\nI see my dear friend, Senator Doug Jones: You will always be my Senator! And his lovely wife, Louise, thank you.\\xa0\\nThe Biden Administration knows that the time is now to address the systemic inequities that have left so many families struggling to make it. Together with Congressional Democrats, we passed the American Rescue Plan because of our fundamental belief that good governance creates an environment that allows all of our people to reach their full potential. If we’ve learned anything during this pandemic, it’s that we cannot wait a single day to provide resources to America’s working and struggling families to try and level the playing field, especially for our children. That is why I\\'m so proud to have been the only Democrat in Alabama’s Delegation to vote in favor of the 1.9 trillion dollar American Rescue Plan.\\xa0\\nWe know that one of the greatest contributors to the opportunity gap between children in communities like the one we’re in right now and the ones in wealthy neighborhoods across the nation is the financial investment the parents are able to make in their children. Every parent I met in my district, irrespective of zip code, wanted the best for their children, but they struggle day in and day out just to make ends meet. They fall behind when it matters most and we know that we need additional resources for our public schools.\\nI am proud that we are investing in our public schools not just immediately but also acknowledging that we need remedial help as well. Our children learn best in the classroom and we all know that which is why the American Rescue Plan will be giving direct assistance to individual school systems such as Jefferson County Public Schools and the City of Birmingham Public Schools. That is hundreds of millions of dollars and that money will be earmarked to not only deal with COVID-19 relief now to get our children back into schools safely, but also to deal with the remedial learning that we know our children will need. And so I want you all to know that the American Rescue Plan is truly that: a rescue plan to deal with COVID-19 and make sure our communities not only survive this pandemic, but they thrive through it!\\nAs of 2019, 34% of the children in my district lived below the poverty line and 53% of those children, that\\'s over half of the children in America, do not receive the full benefits of the Child Tax Credit because it isn’t fully refundable. We know that our response has to be big and bold in this rescue plan.\\xa0\\nIt is important that we use every tool in the toolbox to deal with this pandemic and to provide relief. As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, our jurisdiction is taxes. It is the revenue-generating operation of the House, and we thought that it was critically important that we make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable.\\xa0\\nWhat do I mean by that? By making this Child Tax Credit fully refundable, we are reaching the neediest of families. We are not only doing that, we are also expanding it by providing direct payments in the form of a child allowance. This year families will receive $3,600 per child under the age of 6 and $3,000 per child for children between the ages of 6 and 16. These payments will be made on a recurring monthly basis with families receiving their first checks hopefully in July.\\xa0\\nThis is about saving working families and ensuring our children get out of poverty. As a lifelong educator, I know that Dr. Jill Biden has dedicated herself to transforming the lives of American children. Now, as the First Lady, she has taken the same vigor and applied it to eradicating child poverty. We know that just by making the Child Tax Credit fully refundable that we can lift 40% of the children living below the poverty line above it. The American Rescue Plan not only provides help, but it also uplifts our community and it does so for our children as well.\\xa0\\nI want to say in closing that it was Martin Luther King that said, “poverty is a state of mind but, it also is a state of existence\" and we in the greatest country in the world, should not have anyone living in poverty. We need to figure out a way that we can provide the resources so that every child can grow up and reach their fullest potential. We see that with the wonderful children here at the YWCA and we saw that at the James Rushton Early Learning Center.\\xa0\\nI am so happy that Dr. Jill Biden chose to come to Alabama, to Birmingham, to tell us that the help that we’ve been looking for is here. It is going to be incumbent on all of us in this room to use those resources to the best of our ability to make sure that everyone gets through this pandemic.\\xa0\\nBackground on the American Rescue Plan District Tour:\\xa0\\nRep. Sewell’s American Rescue Plan District Tour is a series of site visits, roundtable discussions, and constituency meetings to connect residents of Alabama’s 7th Congressional District with all the resources available in the American Rescue Plan. The tour began on Tuesday, March 23, 2021, and will continue through April.\\xa0\\nAnnouncements, photos and videos from the tour will be made available on Rep. Sewell’s social media on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as on her website at Sewell.house.gov.\\xa0\\xa0\\nVideo of Rep. Sewell’s remarks can be found here.

       "  'date': 'March 29, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (D-AL), John Katko (NY-24), Tom Suozzi (NY-03), and Rodney Davis (IL-13) introduced legislation that would take critical steps towards reducing nationwide physician shortages by boosting the number of Medicare-supported residency positions. The Resident Physician Shortage Act of 2021 would support an additional 2,000 positions each year from 2023 to 2029, for a total of 14,000 residency positions.\\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the urgent need for qualified doctors in Alabama and across our Nation. That is why I am re-introducing the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act to increase the number of Medicare-supported residency positions to meet our growing demand for quality health care,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “I am proud this bipartisan legislation also provides hospitals and health centers the tools they need to increase access to care, lower wait times for patients, and create a pipeline of qualified medical professionals to serve Americans’ health needs.”\\n“I’m proud to reintroduce this bipartisan measure to help hospitals in Central New York and nationwide recruit and retain medical residents,” said Rep. Katko. “Our nation faces a dire physician shortage, and we need to do more to allow teaching hospitals and academic medical centers to train more healthcare professionals.\\xa0 This measure adds more residency spots to Medicare’s Graduate Medical Education (GME) program to train emerging physicians and ensure communities nationwide have better access to care.”\\n\"If COVID has shown us anything, it\\'s that we need more highly trained doctors,\" said Rep. Suozzi. \"Ensuring there are more opportunities for aspiring doctors to go through residency programs will help our nation provide better care, lower wait times, and increase access to health care.\"\\n“Like many critical professions, our nation is facing a shortage of physicians. As our population grows and ages, it’s vital that we do everything we can at the federal level to remove barriers to encourage more individuals to enter the medical profession,” said Rep. Davis. “That’s why I’m proud to team up my colleagues in the House to introduce the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act. Our bipartisan legislation provides teaching hospitals with the tools they need to increase the number of students they can host for their residency training, helping to alleviate the physician shortage.”\\nTo become a practicing doctor in the U.S., medical school graduates must complete a residency program. However, for the past two decades, an artificial cap on the number of residents funded by Medicare – which is the primary source of payment for residents – has limited the expansion of training programs and the number of trainees.\\xa0\\nAccording to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the United States will face a physician shortage of between 42,600 and 121,300 physicians by 2030. As the American population grows older, the demand for physicians and other medical professionals will increase. This demand has been made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the vital role that physicians and other health care providers play in our nation’s health care infrastructure. The Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act would help expand the physician workforce to address the estimated shortage of physicians and serve as an essential component of our efforts to address current and future public health crises, as well as to bolster our nation’s health care infrastructure and help ensure access to high-quality health care for all. The AAMC is committed to working with Representatives Sewell, Katko, Suozzi, and Davis, along with their House colleagues, to enact this critical piece of legislation that will help alleviate the doctor shortage and improve the health of people everywhere,” said David J. Skorton, MD, President and CEO of Association of American Medical Colleges.\\xa0\\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the nation’s worsening physician shortage and the critical importance of teaching hospitals and their mission to train medical residents,” said Greater New York Hospital Association President Kenneth E. Raske. \\xa0“This important bill tackles the problem head-on by adding 14,000 Medicare-funded graduate medical education slots. The teaching hospital community thanks Representatives Sewell, Katko, Suozzi and Davis for their leadership on this vital issue.”\\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of having an adequate physician workforce.\\xa0 The long-standing cap on Medicare-supported graduate medical education positions restricts access to care by narrowing the pipeline of future physicians practicing in the United States,” said Dr. Susan R. Bailey, President of the American Medical Association.\\xa0 “The AMA is proud to support the bipartisan Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act as the allocation of 14,000 new residency slots will improve access to care regardless of where patients live.”\\nThe Resident Physician Shortage Act of 2021 is available here.',\n",

       "  'date': 'March 15, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. -\\xa0Today, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07), Jodey Arrington (TX-19), Raul Ruiz (CA-36), and Richard Hudson (NC-08) introduced the Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act, legislation to ensure timely Medicare coverage of groundbreaking early cancer detection tests for our nation’s seniors.\\xa0 The bipartisan legislation promotes emerging advances in our nation’s fight against cancer by ensuring Medicare coverage for new, innovative tests that detect multiple types of cancer before symptoms develop.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Cancer survival rates are higher when detected early, and groundbreaking scientific advances in early cancer detection tests have put America on top in the global fight against cancer,” said Rep. Sewell, the lead sponsor of the bill. “The lack of access to preventative services and treatments dramatically impacts health outcomes, particularly among our minority, economically fragile, and rural communities. This legislation will address those inequities by modernizing the Medicare statute to ensure timely access to multi-cancer screening for beneficiaries.”\\n“Multi-cancer early detection is an incredible example of the US leading in medical innovation,” said lead Republican cosponsor from the Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Arrington.\\xa0 “This type of screening has the potential to drastically improve quality of life for American cancer patients and their families, and early detection will save taxpayer dollars by treating cancer before it spreads. I am proud to support this legislation and pave the way for Medicare beneficiaries to access this life-changing technology.”\\n“Detecting cancer early improves health outcomes and saves lives,” said lead Democratic cosponsor from the Energy and Commerce Committee, Dr. Ruiz. “With innovative medical technologies, we can catch more cancers earlier than ever, but patients must be able to access these screenings. That’s why it’s very important for Medicare policy to keep pace with the development of multi-cancer screenings. I am glad to join my colleagues in introducing the Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act of 2021 to modernize Medicare coverage so older Americans can access these screenings and improve their health outcomes.”\\n“Families are devastated by a cancer diagnosis and as the second leading cause of death in the United States, it happens all too often,” said lead Republican cosponsor from the Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Richard Hudson. “By increasing access to multi-cancer early detection screening tests through Medicare, we can detect cancers sooner and save lives in North Carolina and around the country. As a member of the Health Subcommittee, I once again look forward to advancing this bipartisan legislation.”\\n“The National Minority Quality Forum is grateful to Rep. Sewell for her continued work to reduce patient risk by improving cancer detection and treatment outcomes. Cancer impacts all populations, but it is particularly devastating for communities of color. Clearing the path to multi-cancer early detection technology is an essential component of efforts to close documented gaps in cancer outcomes among historically disenfranchised racial and ethnic groups, and will make a difference for all Americans. The Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act is forward-looking and responsive to the needs of American families and communities,” said Gary A. Puckrein, PhD, President and CEO of the National Minority Quality Forum.\\n“As an organization solely dedicated to saving lives through cancer prevention and early detection, we are thrilled to lead a chorus of voices in supporting the introduction of the Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screen Coverage Act of 2021,” said Jody Hoyos, Executive Vice President, Prevent Cancer Foundation. “Providing a pathway for Medicare to cover early detection tests is a critical step for ensuring our seniors—who are at higher risk for cancer—have access to lifesaving new technology.”\\xa0\\nWe know early detection of cancer saves lives,” said Lisa Lacasse, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN). “By creating a pathway for Medicare to cover new, innovative, FDA-approved screening tests, this legislation would help provide more individuals with access to additional tools they and their providers can utilize to detect cancer at an earlier, more treatable stage.\\nThe Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act responds to a misalignment between advances in science and Medicare coverage by allowing for Medicare coverage of multi-cancer screening. The legislation would:\\xa0\\n\\nCreate the authority for CMS to cover blood-based multi-cancer early detection tests and future test methods (like urine or hair tests), once approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Congress has acted before to create coverage for other cancer screenings including mammography and colorectal screenings.\\xa0\\nMaintain CMS’ authority to use an evidence-based process to determine coverage parameters for these new tests.\\nState that these new tools will complement, not replace, existing screenings and coverage and cost sharing will not be impacted.\\n\\nUnder current law, Medicare coverage of preventive services is limited to circumstances in which Congress has explicitly authorized coverage or the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends the service with a grade of A or B.\\xa0 In the absence of this legislation, it could take several years after FDA approval before Medicare beneficiaries could receive coverage for such tests. This bill would greatly reduce delays for seniors while allowing CMS to use its evidence-based process to determine coverage. Accordingly, these new multi-cancer screening tools will complement existing screenings and dramatically improve our nation’s cancer early detection capabilities.\\nMore than 300 organizations across the country, led by the Prevent Cancer Foundation, and other high-profile leaders in the cancer advocacy community, shared a letter in support of the Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act. Local and national patient advocates, healthcare organizations, clinicians, and other stakeholders from all 50 states urged Congress to pass this critical legislation.\\nThe text of the Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act can be found here.',\n",

This legislation will place another tool in our arsenal to detect cancer early when it is easiest to treat and survival is greatest.\"\\n“As the Chief Executive Officer of the Rural Health Medical Program, I see firsthand that the health of rural residents suffers because of where we live,” said Keshee Dozier-Smith, CEO of the Rural Health Medical Program. The communities that we serve are underinsured and uninsured minorities that suffer from chronic health conditions, with cancer being one of the leading deaths that go undetected in rural communities in Alabama due to the lack of availability and affordability. Providing access to Multi-cancer Early Detection Screenings creates opportunities to make real progress in the individuals and families we serve sooner rather than later in closing this gap.”\\nThe Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act responds to a misalignment between advances in science and Medicare coverage by allowing for Medicare coverage of multi-cancer screening. It would:\\n\\n\\nCreate the authority for CMS to cover blood-based multi-cancer early detection tests and future test methods (like urine or hair tests), once approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Congress has acted before to create coverage for other cancer screenings including mammography and colorectal screenings.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMaintain CMS’ authority to use an evidence-based process to determine coverage parameters for these new tests.\\n\\n\\nState that these new tools will complement, not replace, existing screenings and coverage and cost sharing will not be impacted.\\n\\n\\nUnder current law, Medicare coverage of preventive services is limited to circumstances in which Congress has explicitly authorized coverage or the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends the service with a grade of A or B.\\xa0 In the absence of this legislation, it could take several years after the FDA approval before Medicare beneficiaries could receive coverage for such tests. This bill would greatly reduce any such access delays for seniors while allowing CMS to use its evidence-based process to determine coverage. Accordingly, these new multi-cancer screening tools will complement existing screenings and dramatically improve our nation’s cancer early detection capabilities.\\n\\xa0The Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act has the support of a number of organizations, including the: National Minority Quality Forum (NMQF), American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN), Prevent Cancer Foundation, Association of Community Cancer Centers, and Cancer Support Community.\\nThe text of the Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act can be found here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, DC - U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (D-AL) and Rep. Jason Smith (R-MO) led a bipartisan group of 42 Members of Congress in a letter urging the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to ensure that the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who will be enrolling in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans in 2021 have access to a sufficient number of providers and locations to access their dialysis care. The bipartisan letter was written in response to CMS’s decision to remove outpatient dialysis facilities from time and distance standards in Medicare Advantage (MA).\\xa0\\xa0\\nRead the full letter to CMS Administrator Seema Verma.\\n“As representative of a congressional district with one of the highest rates of dialysis patients in the country, I am deeply concerned about the consequences of CMS’s decision to remove outpatient dialysis facilities from time and distance standards in Medicare Advantage, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “It is incumbent on CMS to carefully monitor network adequacy and patient access, as well as maintain the current standards for ESRD patients who transition to Medicare Advantage. Network adequacy protections are critical to ensure that dialysis patients, who are among the most medically fragile patients, have unfettered access to adequate coverage of the dialysis care they depend on.”\\n“The elimination of the time and distance standards would result in increased travel time for ESRD patients in rural areas and undermine the intent of the ESRD Choice Act.” said Rep. Smith. “It is vital that ESRD patients enrolling in Medicare Advantage have access to an outpatient dialysis facility near their home and I look forward to working with CMS to ensure ESRD patients enrolling in Medicare Advantage have the protections they deserve.”\\nDue to the removal of network adequacy protections for outpatient dialysis care by CMS, the 2021 transition that allows all ESRD patients to enroll in MA will not meet its full potential to improve outcomes, and dialysis patients who enroll in MA will be at greater risk due to weakened network adequacy protections. Specifically, ESRD patients could have increased travel time to covered dialysis facilities, which has been shown to negatively impact patients’ quality of life, adherence to treatment, and overall health outcomes.\\nData shows that African American, Hispanic, and low-income patients are disproportionately impacted by ESRD. These populations already face significant disparities in care access and outcomes. Moreover, ESRD is a key risk factor for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. At a time when ESRD patients are particularly vulnerable to increased public exposure and changes in their care routine, patients should be able to access the most clinically appropriate facility-based care close to home.',\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted in favor of the Updated Heroes Act, House Democrats’ latest legislation to address the ongoing needs that have resulted from the COVID-19 public health crisis. This bill reflects current negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, as well as needs that have risen since the original Heroes Act passed the House of Representatives in May 2020.\\n“It is unfortunate that the White House and Senate Republicans have not been willing to compromise to provide additional money for ongoing relief to our communities, workers, and families,” Sewell said. “With passage of the Updated Heroes Act today, House Democrats’ have given the White House and Senate Republicans one more chance to pass another stimulus bill that will continue to provide critical relief for the American people.”\\xa0\\n“The provisions in the Updated Heroes Act are essential to avert greater economic and health catastrophe for families, schools, small businesses, essential workers, and health care providers in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District,” Sewell continued. “Not only does this legislation deliver much-needed resources to Alabama counties and cities, it also reflects House Democrats’ willingness to compromise in good faith to ensure our country can weather this ongoing crisis.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Updated Heroes Act would provide counties and cities in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District with $396 million in funding to cover coronavirus-related outlays and revenue loss and pay our health care workers, library staff, law enforcement, fire, transportation, EMS, teachers and other vital workers who keep us safe and are in danger of losing their jobs. A town-by-town breakdown of the estimated funding allocations for the 7th District under the Updated Heroes Act is available here.\\nIn addition to resources for our state, local, tribal and territorial governments, the Updated Heroes Act maintains key priorities from the original version of the legislation that passed the House in May. The bill also provides families with a second round of direct payments of $1,200 for each individual and $500 for each dependent, and extends weekly $600 federal unemployment payments through January 2021.\\xa0\\nAmong the bill’s many provisions, it:\\n\\n\\nProvides strong support for small businesses by improving the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to serve the smallest businesses and struggling non-profits, providing hard-hit businesses with second loans, and delivering targeted assistance for the struggling restaurant industry and independent live venue operators.\\n\\n\\nMore funds to bolster education and child care, with $225 billion for education – including $182 billion for K12 schools and nearly $39 billion for postsecondary education – and $57 billion to support child care for families.\\n\\n\\nSupports testing, tracing and treatment, through $75 billion for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and isolation measures, with special attention to the disparities facing communities of color, ensuring every American can access free coronavirus treatment, and supporting hospitals and providers. The updated bill also includes $28 billion for procurement, distribution and education campaigns for a safe and effective vaccine.\\n\\n\\nProtects payrolls, by enhancing the new employee retention tax credit that encourages employers to keep employees on payroll.\\n\\n\\nPreserves health coverage, protecting Americans losing their employer-provided health insurance by making unemployed Americans automatically receive the maximum ACA subsidy on the exchanges, as well as a special enrollment period in the ACA exchanges for uninsured Americans.\\n\\n\\nStrengthens food security, addressing rising hunger with a 15 percent increase to the maximum SNAP benefit and additional funding for nutrition programs that help families put food on the table as well as targeted support for farmers and producers impacted by the crisis.\\n\\n\\nSafeguards our democracy, with new resources to ensure safe elections, an accurate Census, and preserve the Postal Service.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n###',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Reps. Marc Veasey (TX-33) and Terri Sewell (AL-07)today introduced legislation to ensure that all states that expand Medicaid coverage under the terms of the Affordable Care Act receive an equal federal match for expansion, regardless of when a state chooses to expand Medicaid coverage.\\n“The writing is on the wall and the facts are clear: premiums and health care costs are higher in states that have not expanded Medicaid. And over 90% of rural hospital closures have been in states that did not expand Medicaid before the closure. In my state, approximately 314,000 more Alabamians would be covered under Medicaid expansion. Not doing so is a poor decision,” Sewell said. “And while I can’t force Alabama’s governor to expand Medicaid, I can continue to promote legislation that provides more incentives for her to do so. Today’s legislation is a step in the right direction and I look forward to working with my colleagues to get it passed.”\\n“The bill will create an incentive for all eligible States to provide affordable health care coverage for all of their citizens,” Veasey said. “In Texas, approximately 638,000 people would gain coverage if Medicaid were expanded. This is a no-brainer for the state of Texas and for the fourteen states across the country who haven’t adopted this program.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor states that chose to expand their Medicaid programs to cover individuals up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level during the first three years of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government covered the full cost of expansion for those three years. Unfortunately, under current law, states that have not yet expanded Medicaid have missed the window to receive a full federal match for any amount of time.\\nTo incentivize states to expand the program, Sewell and Veasey’s legislation would allow states that expand Medicaid in the future to receive a 100 percent federal match for the first three years, 95 percent for the fourth year, 94 percent for the fifth year, 93 percent for the sixth year and 90 percent for each year thereafter.\\nThe bill would allow thousands of low-income families and non-elderly adults without children to enroll in Medicaid, giving them access to affordable health insurance. In Alabama, this population currently makes too much or isn’t eligible to enroll in Medicaid and makes too little to qualify for tax credits through the ACA marketplace.\\xa0\\nThe Incentivizing Medicaid Expansion Act of 2019 is available here.\\n[[{\"fid\":\"932\",\"view_mode\":\"full\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"full\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"full\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false}},\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"media-element file-full\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Wednesday, December 12, the House of Representatives passed the Farm Bill in a bipartisan vote, including legislation sponsored by Congresswoman Terri Sewell (D-AL) and Congressman Mike Rogers (R-AL) to address deteriorating wastewater infrastructure in rural communities. Known as the Rural Septic Tank Access Act (H.R. 5837), the legislation provides grants for the construction and repair of decentralized wastewater systems in underserved areas. Senator Doug Jones (D-AL) introduced a companion bill in the Senate. The Farm Bill, including the Rural Septic Tank Access Act, now heads to the White House where it will be signed into law.\\n“Passage of the Rural Septic Tank Access Act is a huge victory for Alabama and for rural families across the country,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “I have seen firsthand the economic, environmental, and health challenges created by failing sewer systems in Alabama. By investing in our rural communities and providing families with adequate resources to afford proper septic systems, the Rural Septic Tank Access Act takes an important step forward in our work to improve wastewater infrastructure in rural communities. As Congress considers bipartisan infrastructure reform in the new year, I will continue fighting for water and wastewater investments that protect our families’ health and our environment.”\\n“As a Farm Bill Conferee, I was proud to fight to include this language in the Farm Bill,” said Rep. Mike Rogers. “The Farm Bill is critically important to our state, and many Alabamians gain access to rural development and infrastructure through the Farm Bill. Rural America can’t be left behind, and this language ensures that folks in our districts and across America have a way forward from failing wastewater infrastructure.”\\nThe Farm Bill’s Rural Septic Tank Access Act provision will expand the Household Water Well System Grant Program to provide grants of up to $15,000 for rural low- and moderate-income households to install or maintain individually-owned decentralized wastewater systems. This grant program would be administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\\xa0 While there is no national study estimating the number of Americans with failing septic systems, estimates suggest that over a million families may face unsafe conditions as a result of inadequate rural wastewater systems.\\nIn March, Rep. Sewell worked with House appropriators to secure $1.8 billion in additional funding for water and wastewater infrastructure under USDA as part of an omnibus spending bill. In Uniontown, Alabama, that funding is already at work. In November, USDA announced a $23.4 million grant to Uniontown to repair the city’s existing wastewater treatment plant and install new infrastructure.\\n###\\nRep. Terri A.

For our rural hospitals, this legislation encourages CMS to evaluate how regional disparities in reimbursement policies contribute to the rural hospital closure crisis. For too long, Alabama’s rural hospitals have been short-changed by healthcare policy that rewards hospitals in wealthy states at the expense of hospitals in rural, low-income communities.”\\n“Additionally, the legislation we passed today provides funding for our troops, increases disaster aid by more than $7 billion in response to Hurricane Florence, and increases research funding for Alabama’s vibrant medical and defense research infrastructure.

Over 900,000 Alabamians rely on Medicare for healthcare coverage, but President Trump’s budget cuts Medicare funding by $500 billion. In our state, the Trump budget will mean a higher out-of-pocket bill for patients, less coverage, and worse health outcomes for our working families.”\\n“These cuts will also have a major impact on our hospitals, many of which are just barely making ends meet. In my district, rural hospitals are cutting services and trying their best to provide quality care with dwindling reimbursements.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Friday, November 3, the House of Representatives voted to reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), offsetting the reauthorization with cuts to Medicare, the Prevention and Public Health Fund, and other health programs. Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) voted against the bill when it passed by a 242 to 174 vote.\\n“I have been a vocal advocate for the reauthorization of CHIP, but today’s bill uses unfair and inappropriate offsets to shift the cost of CHIP onto the rest of the healthcare system,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “Paying for one set of essential health programs by cutting funds for another is a losing strategy in the fight for better public health and more affordable care for all. When it comes to children’s health insurance, Republican leadership has set up a false choice, offering CHIP reauthorization at the expense of other vital programs.”\\n“To make matters worse, today’s bill leaves struggling hospitals on the hook for more extreme cuts to disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments. Rural hospitals in my district rely on DSH payments to keep their doors open, and these cuts will directly impact their ability to provide care. Republican leaders have failed the American people by letting essential health programs expire, like payments for rural hospitals and ambulance providers. We need to extend every single program that expired in September, including CHIP, diabetes research, teaching health center graduate medical research, and others, to ensure that providers and patients have the support they need.”\\nThe CHIP reauthorization bill cuts the Medicare program by $5.8 billion. The bill also cuts the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Prevention and Public Health Fund by $6.35 billion and shortens the ACA’s current grace period for paying premiums from 90 days to 30 days, kicking an estimated 700,000 Americans off their health insurance. The bill delays Medicaid DSH cuts for only two years, and pays for the DSH delay by increasing future cuts to $8 billion each year from 2021 through 2025.\\n###\\nRep. Terri A.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. –\\xa0On Wednesday, the national health care open enrollment period begins, enabling people who buy health insurance through the individual marketplace to shop for coverage for 2018. The federal open enrollment period runs from November 1st through December 15th. During this time, constituents have the opportunity to enroll in or change their health care plan. Alabama residents can visit EnrollALA.com for more information or call (844) 248-7698 for free assistance. A full list of Alabama’s local navigators, who can provide fre\\xad\\xade guidance on signing up for health care through the individual marketplace, is available here.\\n“The Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “The open enrollment period is a great opportunity for my constituents to shop for new coverage with the help of premium assistance. Enroll Alabama and the free support provided by Alabama’s local health care navigators makes it easy for families to find insurance that fits their needs. Whether you already have coverage through the individual marketplace or you are looking to get covered next year, I encourage everyone to check out their health care options during the open enrollment period.\"\\n“As hospitals in my district face financial challenges and families struggle to afford doctor’s visits, I am deeply disappointed by the Trump Administration’s decision to cut advertising for the open enrollment period. Too many Americans do not know how to navigate the insurance enrollment process and I believe we have a responsibility to raise public awareness about how to sign up for affordable health insurance. We must do everything in our power to increase coverage, reduce costs, and stabilize the insurance marketplace for all Americans.”\\nThe Trump Administration has purposefully taken actions to undermine the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Administration has made sharp cuts to advertising for the ACA’s open enrollment period and funding for health care navigators who help Alabamians enroll. The enrollment period for the federal marketplace has also been cut in half, to 45 days, with little publicity by federal officials. In addition, the Administration’s announced plan to cut cost-sharing subsidies for low-income families has created confusion among many Americans enrolled in the insurance marketplace and millions more who remain uninsured.\\n###\\nRep.

Sewell (D-AL) and Congressman Ralph Abraham, M.D. (R-LA) led a bipartisan group of 174 Members of Congress in a letter urging the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) \\xa0not to finalize cuts to Medicare payments for home health providers until stakeholders can fully analyze the impact of the proposed changes. The proposed CMS cuts would result in an estimated loss of $950 million for home health providers that care for more than 3.5 million Medicare beneficiaries across the country.\\nRead the full letter to HHS Acting Secretary Eric Hargan and CMS Administrator Seema Verma.\\n“Home health providers are a lifeline for constituents in my district, including seniors, disabled individuals, and those with limited mobility. These services are critical in saving long-term hospital costs, keeping families together, and promoting dignity and independence for our seniors,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “Today’s letter vocalized the concerns of a bipartisan group of Members of Congress who believe that CMS’ proposed policy has the potential to seriously harm the delivery of home health services at a time when we need to be strengthening our home health resources for an aging population. Given more time, I am confident that lawmakers, stakeholders, and CMS can work together to find a payment approach that protects patient access to care and caregiver resources.”\\n“Home health is a critical health care option for people throughout the United States, particularly those living in rural areas like I represent,” said Dr. Ralph Abraham “The proposed CMS policy change could have severe consequences in delivering home health services, which will result in more hospitalizations and more families being separated when sick loved ones need support the most. I thank Congresswoman Sewell and the other members who signed our letter for joining together to ask for a delay to this rule change so that we can ensure patients continue to have access to home health services.”\\n“Not enough is known about this proposed care delivery and payment model for home health services and how it would impact patients’ access to those services.\\xa0 Fortunately, Rep. Sewell and Dr. Abraham recognize these concerns and we greatly appreciate their leadership in getting more than 170 of their colleagues to encourage CMS to not finalize this proposal,” said HealthSouth President and CEO Mark Tarr.\\nThe Home Health Groupings Model (HHGM) proposal would significantly redefine the Medicare home health benefit, imposing a 15% reduction in payment levels and an untested case mix adjustment model. If implemented, HHGM will diminish the value that home health services bring to the Medicare system and create unnecessary barriers to care for the seniors who rely on them.\\n###\\nRep. Terri A.

As a matter of fact, 80 percent of rural hospital closures since 2010 have occurred in states that didn’t expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – On Wednesday, August 2, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) joined Congressman\\xa0Mike Kelly (R-PA) in announcing the introduction of the Strong Families Act (H.R. 3595), a bill to encourage employers to provide paid family medical leave. The Strong Families Act creates a tax credit for employers who voluntarily offer at least four weeks of paid leave. Senator Deb Fischer (R-NE) and Senator Angus King (I-ME) introduced a companion bill (S. 1716) Tuesday in the Senate.\\n“I’m a strong believer that our workforce needs to be family friendly and that our tax policies should incentivize the behavior we want to see,” said Rep. \\xa0Sewell. “The Strong Families Act builds on these principles by encouraging employers to provide paid leave for parents to care for sick children, for new mothers who need time off, and for children to care for sick parents. Looking out for America’s working families should be a bipartisan priority, and I’m proud to have worked with Members of Congress from both parties to introduce today’s bill. By using the tax code to incentivize the kind of behavior we would like to see from American employers, we can update workforce practices for how families live and work in the 21st century.”\\n“Strong families make strong communities,” said Rep. Kelly. “Strong communities build a stronger country.\\xa0 I’m happy and proud to sponsor the Strong Families Act and incentivize the private sector to enact workplace policies that will make a difference for families.”\\n“Today we are introducing a new version of paid leave legislation I’ve worked on for years, and I’m proud say we are doing it with bipartisan and bicameral support,” said Sen. Fischer. “For too many families, balancing responsibilities at home and in the workplace is a source of stress. I believe this legislation will positively impact people’s lives and help make paid leave available to more Americans.”\\n“Updating our country’s family leave policies will not only help strengthen families, but will also strengthen our economy,” said Sen. King. “By encouraging family-friendly policies at work, this bipartisan legislation will provide working parents and caregivers in Maine and across the country with more flexibility to take care of their children and aging parents while also pursuing their careers. The Strong Families Act will support this 21st century work environment and make our communities and our economy more resilient.”\\nUnder current law, the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) requires employers to provide up to 12-weeks of job-protected unpaid leave for qualified medical and family reasons. To qualify for FMLA, a worker must be employed by a business for at least 12 months. The United States is the only developed nation in the world with no guaranteed paid leave of any kind.\\nThe Strong Families Act would provide employers a 25 percent nonrefundable tax credit for each hour of paid leave offered to qualified employees. Consistent with the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), eligible employers would not be required to offer paid leave to employees who have been on the job for less than a year. The Strong Families Act would also allow part-time employees to be eligible for a pro-rata portion of paid leave.\\n###\\nRep. Terri A.

       "  'text': \"WASHINGTON – Congressman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) cosponsored the introduction of H.R. 3044, bipartisan legislation that allows Medicare Advantage insurance plans to offer a wider array of benefits to chronically ill enrollees. The legislation waives uniformity requirements among Medicare Advantage plans and allows insurers to offer plans better tailored to meet the individual needs of patients with chronic illness.\\n“Many benefits necessary to improving health outcomes and quality of life for our seniors affected by chronic illness are not traditionally covered by Medicare Advantage,” said Congresswoman Sewell. “For the 363,000 Alabamians enrolled in Medicare Advantage who suffer from one or more chronic illnesses, our bipartisan bill will enable better care coordination so they can access the benefits that meet their needs, including transportation services, nutrition programs, in-home support services, and more. Protecting our seniors’ health should not be a partisan issue, and I’m proud to have worked across the aisle to introduce bipartisan legislation to help seniors living with chronic conditions, like so many in Alabama.”\\nThe legislation was introduced by Congressman Patrick Meehan, and other original co-sponsors include Reps. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.), Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), and Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.).\\n“Increasing rates of chronic illness among older Americans and an aging population are real challenges for our health care system,” said Congressman Meehan. “Chronic illnesses account for 70 percent of deaths in Pennsylvania each year, and seniors with chronic conditions are more likely to visit an emergency room or require hospitalization. More than a million seniors in Pennsylvania utilize Medicare Advantage plans. This bill will help seniors obtain a Medicare Advantage plan with benefits that best meet their needs. The result will be improved care and services for seniors coping with diabetes, arthritis and other chronic conditions.”\\n“Many New Jerseyans count on Medicare Advantage,” said Congressman Lance. “I am pleased to join Congressman Meehan in this legislation to further advance the goals of Medicare Advantage and help craft a plan to provide patient-specific benefits for chronically ill enrollees.\\xa0 Expanding supplemental benefits can improve the lives of chronically ill individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage.\\xa0 We want to improve health outcomes while also ensuring the Medicare program is stable and continues provide high quality health care.”\\n“I'm proud to support this bipartisan bill, which will facilitate better care coordination for millions of seniors affected by chronic illness,” said Congresswoman DeGette. “By allowing plans to cover supplemental benefits that are not traditionally covered by Medicare Advantage, such as case management and meal delivery, we can deliver better health outcomes and quality of life for seniors who have complex care needs.”\\n“On behalf of the senior advocates, aging professionals, providers, and beneficiaries in our coalition, we commend this first step taken by Representatives Patrick Meehan, Terri Sewell, Diana DeGette, Joseph Kennedy and Leonard Lance to enable Medicare Advantage to offer a wider range of enhanced benefits critical to the delivery of high-quality, cost-effective health care to beneficiaries with multiple chronic illnesses,” said Allyson Y.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – On Monday, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) published a report highlighting the severe cost and impact of the Senate’s TrumpCare legislation. The new CBO analysis shows that the bill would eliminate health insurance for an estimated 22 million Americans and raise health care costs for seniors and working families. Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) releases the following statement:\\n“This week’s report from the Congressional Budget Office makes it clear that the Republican repeal bill was never about ‘health care reform,’ it’s about cutting taxes for the wealthy. The facts show that the latest TrumpCare bill would eliminate health insurance for 22 million Americans, raise premiums on low-income seniors by 280 percent, and force many Americans onto insurance plans that fail to cover essential health services. If Republicans are really committed to improving health care in this country, they need to go back to the drawing board and work on bipartisan legislation with input from patients, health care providers, and the public. No more backroom meetings, no more secret drafts, it is time for an open debate on health care that puts our constituents’ needs first.”\\nThe CBO’s estimates of insurance coverage, premiums and federal spending are influenced by the fact that the office’s forecast covers a ten-year period. Many of the worst cuts to health care in the Senate’s bill are tilted toward the latter part of the next decade, essentially hiding the cuts from the CBO’s analysis.\\nSince the release of the Senate’s TrumpCare bill last week, patients groups, hospitals, doctors, and seniors groups have announced their strong opposition to the bill. Analysis by the Center for American Progress suggests that coverage losses under the Senate Health Care Repeal Bill could result in 18,100 to 27,700 additional deaths by 2026.\\n###\\nRep. Terri A.

Simply put, the cuts to Medicaid in the Senate’s draft of TrumpCare would impact all of us, through longer waiting times for all patients, and the closures of hospitals and primary care practices that cannot withstand deep cuts to such a large portion of their revenue. Regardless of how one gets health insurance in Alabama, we all have much to lose under TrumpCare.”\\nSince its release on Thursday, patients groups, hospitals, doctors, and seniors groups have announced their strong opposition to the Senate TrumpCare draft. Analysis by the Center for American Progress suggests that coverage losses under the Senate Health Care Repeal Bill could result in 18,100 to 27,700 additional deaths by 2026.\\n###\\nRep. Terri A.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C.\\xa0– Today, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) joined Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) in introducing the bipartisan Cancer Care Payment Reform Act. The bill establishes a five-year demonstration project using the framework of the successful patient-centered Oncology Medical Home (OMH) model developed by community oncologists in recent years. Using the OMH model, physicians have partnered with insurers to pilot several successful payment programs, which have proven to provide better patient care and achieve cost savings to the health care system. The bill has also been introduced in the Senate by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Tom Carper (D-DE) as S.463.\\n“As a representative of many rural and underserved communities with a high prevalence of poor health outcomes, I believe we should be laser-focused on ensuring all patients have access to high-quality, affordable care and treatment close to home,” said Rep. Sewell. “I am proud to sponsor the bipartisan Cancer Care Payment Reform Act with Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers as a means of ensuring cancer patients have access to lifesaving cancer treatment in their community, while promoting revolutionary approaches to the delivery and payment for cancer care. Reducing financial barriers to cancer care is critical to eliminate both the human and financial costs associated with cancer for patients, loved ones, physicians, and the entire economy.”\\n“Medical breakthroughs continue to provide hope to millions of Americans, including cancer patients, and advancements in science have made it possible for cancer patients to receive care in their community and closer to home,” said Rep. McMorris Rodgers. “My legislation updates the Medicare payment process to focus on comprehensive, patient-centered care that puts quality over quantity,” said McMorris Rodgers. “As we continue to search for a cure to cancer, models like this ensure that care is more results-driven and cost-effective for the patient and our nation’s health care system as a whole.”\\nThe National Cancer Institute estimates that roughly 1.6 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States this year alone and more than half a million people are expected to die from the disease. Moreover, the National Institutes of Health reports that cancer costs will reach $158 billion nationally by 2020.\\nThe Cancer Care Payment Reform Act relies on oncology practices to reduce overall costs to the health care system by providing higher quality care and keeping patients out of the hospital where care is most costly. Oncology centers that participate in the program would be rewarded with a portion of the savings under this legislation.\\n###\\n\\nRep. Terri A.

From the creation of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, to the GI Bill, Congress has long recognized the importance of our healthcare safety-net and has worked tirelessly to protect it.

Our healthcare infrastructure, from our rural hospitals to our network of family physicians, cannot withstand that kind of blow to health coverage. I believe that all Americans have a right to affordable healthcare, but this legislation turns healthcare into a privilege. For families in my district, the Republican repeal bill means more expensive coverage with fewer protections. We cannot ask working Americans to go broke, bankrupt, or do without healthcare.”\\nToday’s report from the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation shows that by 2018, five million fewer people would be covered under Medicaid, six million fewer Americans would be covered in the individual market, and a total of 14 million more Americans would be without insurance. The CBO report estimates that in 2018 and 2019, average premiums for single policyholders in the non-group market would rise 15 to 20 percent under the GOP repeal bill.\\nIn addition, the report shows that low-income seniors will see premium increases of $12,900, while the average 40 year old will see an average premium increase of $700.

Sewell opposed the Republican repeal bill when the Committee voted to advance the bill.\\n“I voted against today’s GOP repeal bill for one simple reason: it would raise health costs for working families and struggling Americans while decreasing their quality of coverage,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “My constituents work hard to provide for their families, and additional health costs jeopardize their access to care. The Republican health bill would bankrupt low-income families and the rural hospitals that depend on their access to care by eliminating income-based support for health coverage, slashing Medicaid, and erasing preventative care coverage. The amendments I offered today would have protected rural Americans from increased health costs and growing health disparities. Without those safeguards for working families, and with no estimate yet for this bill’s cost, I could not in good conscience vote for this legislation.”\\nAmong the amendments offered by Rep. Sewell was a measure that would prohibit the Republican health bill from increasing taxes or medical costs for rural farmers and farmers with disabilities. Rep. Sewell drew inspiration for the amendment from a rural farmer in Alabama whose access to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act saved him from financial disaster.\\nRep. Sewell also spoke at the hearing\\xa0about the need to protect against increased health disparities for minority populations. For a wide range of diseases today, the mortality rate for African Americans is much higher than that for other populations.

The GOP health bill would make large cuts to Medicaid, destabilize Medicare by reducing funding for the Medicare trust fund, and increase health costs for working and low-income families. Estimates suggest that 357,000 Alabamians are at risk of losing their coverage if the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is repealed.\\n“For my constituents, access to healthcare is a life or death issue,” said Rep. Terri Sewell (D-AL). “After seven years of calling for the Affordable Care Act’s repeal, it is unconscionable that the best Republican leadership has to offer is a plan that cuts Medicaid, destabilizes Medicare, and takes insurance away from millions of hardworking Americans. In fact, estimates suggest that 357,000 Alabamians are at risk of losing their coverage if we repeal the ACA. Our access to care is a fundamental right, not a privilege. Protecting care for seniors, disabled Americans, and working and low-income families goes to the heart of who we are as a country. We cannot settle for a health plan that leaves millions of Americans without the coverage they need.”\\nStudies show that the GOP health plan would increase costs for the average enrollee by $1,542 if the bill were in effect today. At the same time, the proposed bill eliminates requirements for insurance companies to cover preventative care, and makes it possible for insurers to discriminate against seniors. By cutting Medicaid and reducing health assistance to low-income families, the health bill would reduce revenue for rural hospitals, 700 of which nationwide have been labeled as financially at risk.\\nPatients across Alabama’s 7th District would lose assistance under the GOP health plan. In Jefferson County, residents’ health coverage tax credits will be 33% lower than they were under the ACA.\\nDespite concerns raised by both Republicans and Democrats, House Republicans plan to move forward with consideration of the health bill in the Ways and Means Committee and Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday, March 8. Rep. Sewell is a member of the Ways and Means Committee and will participate in tomorrow’s markup of the GOP health bill.\\n###\\n\\nRep. Terri A.

       "  'date': 'February 2, 2016',\n",
       "  'text': 'Today, Congresswoman Terri Sewell and Congresswoman Diane Black (R-TN) introduced the Fair Medicare Hospital Payments Act of 2016 (H.R. 4428), a bipartisan bill that increases Medicare reimbursements for rural hospitals in Alabama and other states with large rural populations.\\n“When rural hospitals struggle, entire communities suffer. In many parts Alabama’s 7th Congressional District, local hospitals are the lifeblood of the community. When confronted with the unique challenges of caring for older, sicker, and low-income populations, these hospitals are struggling to keep their doors open.\\xa0\\n“The Fair Medicare Hospital Payments Act of 2016 would ensure that these hospitals receive their fair share in Medicare reimbursement dollars. The current reimbursement system is skewed in favor of hospitals serving the healthiest and wealthiest parts of our country. Whenever I visit hospitals in the district, hospital administrators cite reimbursement disparities as one of their top concerns. H.R. 4428 would reverse this trend and increase reimbursements for hospitals in 158 Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) nationwide.\\n“I am proud to work on this very important issue with Rep. Diane Black. The entire Congressional delegations from Alabama, Tennessee, and Arkansas have signed on to this bill and we have also received strong support from members of the Georgia, Kentucky, Texas, and Louisiana delegations. The broad, bipartisan support this bill has garnered in advance of introduction speaks to the urgency of this issue,” said Rep. Sewell.\\n\\xa0Dr. Don Williamson, President of the Alabama Hospital Association expressed the Association’s support for this legislation.\\n\\xa0”The Alabama Hospital Association would like to thank Congresswoman Sewell for introducing this bill, and we are most appreciative that every member in Alabama’s House delegation has joined as co-sponsors.\\xa0 Addressing the broken wage index system is long overdue.\\xa0 It is an inherently unfair system and it is unreasonable for Alabama’s hospitals to be paid dramatically less for the same care as their counterparts in other states.\\xa0 This issue could not be more critical for the survival of the majority of Alabama’s rural hospitals.”\\xa0\\nThe bill also has the support of the National Rural Health Association.\\n“NRHA applauds the introduction of this important bill to ensure that rural providers’ compensation reflects the plethora of challenges related to retention and recruitment in rural America. The Wage Index unfairly penalizes physicians that practice in underserved communities within rural America and this bill takes an important step to reduce this discrepancy.”\\xa0\\nBackground \\nThe bill is strongly supported by a multitude of state hospital associations and the National Rural Health Association (NRHA). The bill’s 31 original cosponsors include the entire Alabama, Tennessee, and Arkansas delegations, as well as members from Georgia, Kentucky, Texas, and Louisiana.\\nThis legislation would establish a national minimum of 0.874 for the Medicare Area Wage Index (AWI) for hospitals. CMS bases a portion of a hospital’s reimbursements for inpatient services based on the AWI, a formula designed to reflect the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the national average. All 13 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) in Alabama have among the lowest AWIs in the country, and would benefit significantly from this legislation. Significant distortions over the past three decades have resulted from administrative and legislative actions favoring certain regions over others. Since the formula is calculated on a budget-neutral basis, any increase from one particular state means a decrease for other states. Under the current system, 20 CBSAs in California, Massachusetts, and New York have AWIs ranging from 1.332 to 1.724, while 158 CBSAs in 25 states have AWIs between 0.685 and 0.874. The Fair Medicare Hospital Payments Act of 2016 is designed to level the playing field so hospitals in those 25 states will no longer endure inadequate reimbursements due to gains in other parts of the country.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\n\\xa0\\n###',\n",

Sewell: Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the award-winning small business owners in Alabama's 7th Congressional District as we celebrate this week, National Small Business Week.\\xa0\\nMs. Jackie Smith is the proud owner and operator of the Coffee Shoppe and Reflections in our hometown of Selma, Alabama. After leaving her job in 2011, Jackie bravely took on the risk of opening up her own small business, turning the site that once was a segregated diner into a beautiful coffee shop in the heart of downtown Selma. For 13 years, the Coffee Shoppe has provided a place for community to come together, learn about Selma's history, and eat some great food.\\nLike any business owner, Jackie has had her fair share of hardships. After the tornado of January 12, 2023, we saw her resilience, and thanks to an investment by the SBA, she was able to open her doors and continue the Coffee Shoppe's great legacy. And in fact, she opened up another business, Reflections.\\xa0\\nThis week, Jackie's extraordinary entrepreneurship earned her national recognition as the Small Business Administration's 2024 Phoenix Award Winner for Outstanding Disaster Recovery Efforts. We congratulate her on her outstanding achievements.\\xa0\\nToday, we also recognize SBA's 2024 Small Business Persons of the Year in Alabama, and that was Shanna Ullmann, Timothy Ullmann, and Robert Prescott of Transformation Partners, LLC in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\\nBeginning in the year 2000 as a statewide training provider, her firm has grown tremendously over the past two decades. Today, they serve numerous clients in the field of higher education, government, military, corporate America, offering consulting services and employee development programming.\\xa0\\nTransformation Partners was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. But once again, thanks to the assistance of the SBA, the firm remained operational and weathered the storm. Now their efforts have earned them national recognition as SBA's 2024 National Small Business Persons of the Year for Alabama.\\xa0\\nI ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the outstanding entrepreneurship in Alabama's 7th Congressional District. Congratulations to all of our winners. We wish you much success in the years ahead.\\n###\",\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) warned that House Republicans are risking serious consequences for Alabama families.\\n“Alabama families shouldn’t be forced to pay the price for House Republicans’ inability to govern,” said Rep Sewell. “A Republican government shutdown would force troops to work without pay, harm small businesses, risk air travel disruptions, and endanger access to food assistance for families. It is unconscionable that House Republicans would hurt working families, damage our economy, and endanger our national security.”\\n“I will continue to do everything in my power to keep the government open and protect the programs that Alabamians rely on,” continued Sewell. “It’s time for House Republicans to do their jobs, put American families first, and stop charging towards a government shutdown.”\\nAccording to new data released by House Budget Committee Minority, a Republican government shutdown would:\\n\\nForce troops to serve without pay: 38,017 active duty and reserve personnel serving our nation's armed forces in Alabama would be forced to go without the pay they earn during a shutdown.\\nHurt Alabama small businesses: The Small Business Administration would stop processing small business loans, halting a program that provides $284,694,700 in funding to small businesses in Alabama every year.\\nDisrupt air travel: 4,797 people flying through Alabama airports every day would face potential delays and safety concerns due to staffing impacts on TSA agents and air traffic controllers.\\nCut off food assistance for Alabama children and families: 111,999 people in Alabama would soon lose access to Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits. 772,813 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) beneficiaries in Alabama would lose access to benefits in a prolonged shutdown.\\nHurt federal workers: 46,826 federal workers in Alabama would be furloughed or forced to work without pay, in addition to the many employees of businesses with government contracts who could be laid off, furloughed, or see their hours cut.\\nJeopardize food and drug safety: Workers at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would be sidelined, risking interruptions and delays to the 224 food safety, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and other inspections conducted in Alabama last year.\\nHurt rural Alabamians’ ability to secure housing loans: The Department of Agriculture would be forced to stop processing housing loans, which provide $545,442,546 in funding to help 3,049 families in rural Alabama communities buy homes every year.\\nHurt Alabama farmers: The Department of Agriculture would be forced to stop processing farm loans which provide $93,451,000 in funding for farmers in Alabama every year.\\nClose National Parks: 1,294,952 people who visit national parks in Alabama every year would be turned away or unable to fully access parks, monuments, and museums.\\nPut vulnerable families at risk: State governments would be forced to pay for federal services like the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, potentially risking benefits for the 12,888 TANF beneficiaries in Alabama.\\n\\nConstituents with questions about the impacts of a Republican government shutdown can visit sewell.house.gov/governmentshutdown.\",\n",

       "  'date': 'June 7, 2023',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Bill Johnson (OH-06), along with Reps. Frank Mrvan and (IN-01) and Beth Van Duyne (TX-24), introduced bipartisan legislation to level the playing field for American workers. H.R. 3882, the Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0, would strengthen U.S. trade remedy laws to protect American workers and combat China’s unfair, anti-free market trade practices that distort the global market. Companion legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Todd Young (R-IN).\\n“As a member of the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, I am committed to ensuring that U.S. trade policy promotes fair competition and protects American workers against the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts to manipulate the global market,” said Rep. Sewell. “Along with Congressman Bill Johnson, I am proud to be introducing the Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 which would strengthen our trade remedy laws and push back against China’s egregious and unfair trade practices. We know that if American workers are given the opportunity to compete on a fair and level playing field, they will win on the world stage!”\\n“China’s communist regime continues taking deliberate steps that are hurting American workers and our economy by dumping steel, aluminum, and other products on the global markets with no repercussions. That must end,” said Rep. Johnson. “This bipartisan legislation will hold China accountable for these actions by ensuring that U.S. industries and the Department of Commerce have needed tools to seek relief from China’s illegal actions. A robust domestic steel and aluminum industry is critical to creating American jobs, strengthening our economy, and protecting our national security. We can’t wait any longer to act. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to ensure this bipartisan bill becomes law.”\\n“Thank you to Rep. Sewell for your steadfast leadership to update U.S. trade remedy laws and combat unfair trade practices,” said Rep. Mrvan. “Every effort must be taken to ensure that American workers can compete on a level playing field and thrive in our global economy.\\xa0 I look forward to continuing to work with all of my colleagues to advance this critical legislation to support the ability of all American workers to grow our economy and provide for our national security.”\\n“The Chinese Communist Party routinely ignores established trading rules and aggressively works to cheat the system in an attempt to shut American workers and manufacturers out of the global market,” said Rep. Van Duyne. “I appreciate Reps. Sewell and Johnson for their leadership on this important issue, and I look forward to continuing our bipartisan work to stand up to the CCP’s unfair trade practices.”\\nThe Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 combats many of China’s most egregious practices, such as:\\n\\nCountry Hopping to Escape U.S. Trade Remedies - After all the work of winning an anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) case, relief can be temporary as foreign producers move their factories to other countries to evade the AD/CVD orders. This legislation creates a new successive AD/CVD investigation to combat repeat offenders by making it easier for petitioners to bring new cases when production moves to another country. It also expedites timelines for successive investigations and factors for the International Trade Commission to consider about the relationship between recently completed trade cases and successive trade cases for the same imported product.\\n\\n\\nBelt and Road Initiative Subsidies - Currently, the Department of Commerce can only consider subsidies provided by the government under investigation. However, with the expansion of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, China is beginning to subsidize production in countries outside of China. This legislation would give Commerce the authority to apply CVD law to subsidies provided by a government to a company operating in a different country.\\n\\n\\nCircumventing U.S. Law - This legislation imposes statutory requirements for anti-circumvention inquiries to clarify the process and timeline. It also specifies the deadlines for preliminary and final determinations, which currently lack statutory deadlines.\\n\\nThe Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 enjoys strong support from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), the United Steelworkers (USW), and steel manufacturers in Alabama.\\n“By strengthening the effectiveness of the U.S. trade laws, this bill will help give the American public confidence that their government has every tool available to fight for a level playing field for the American steel industry and our workers,” said Kevin Dempsey, President and CEO of the American Iron and Steel Institute. “We appreciate the leadership of Representatives Johnson and Sewell in once again spearheading the fight to crack down on unfair trade and help preserve American jobs, competitiveness and cleaner American steel.”\\n“It has been eight years since Congress has updated our trade laws, and Representatives Terri Sewell and Bill Johnson have introduced the Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 to provide a much-needed refresh,” said United Steelworkers President Tom Conway. “The legislation will make U.S. trade laws more responsive to China’s foreign investments, which then dump product into the U.S. market. The bill also improves the process for follow-up on trade investigations, meaning U.S. workers and manufacturers can quickly move to stop unfair trade, wherever it comes from. USW endorses this bill and urges the House of Representatives to move quickly to pass it.”\\nThe Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 can be found here.',\n",

Republicans must join us to raise the debt ceiling—just as they did three times under the previous administration—and avoid economic collapse.”\\n“I am a strong believer in balancing our budget,” continued Sewell. “Despite Republicans’ 2017 tax giveaway to the wealthy—which added $2 trillion to our deficit—I am proud of the historic deficit reduction that we have achieved under President Biden. If Republicans want to address our national debt, they should start by making the wealthy pay their fair share instead of targeting veteran benefits, food assistance, and other programs that hard working Alabama families rely on.”\\nIf agreed to, Speaker McCarthy’s debt ceiling demands would have devastating consequences for Alabama families. According to a report by the House Budget Committee Minority, House Republicans' debt ceiling proposal would:\\n\\nThreaten access to food assistance for 17,000 people aged 50-55 in Alabama.\\nEliminate preschool and child care for at least 5,600 children in Alabama.\\nIncrease housing costs for at least 8,800 people in Alabama.\\nMake college more expensive for at least 98,900 students in Alabama.\\nEliminate at least 3 air traffic control towers in Alabama.\\nCut at least 150 rail safety inspection days in Alabama.\\nRepeal investments in cleaner, cheaper energy — threatening at least 1,280 clean energy and manufacturing jobs announced in Alabama since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.\\n\\nIf Republicans do not get their way, and instead choose to cause an unprecedented credit default, they would unleash global economic catastrophe and put vital government services at risk. According to the report, a default would:\\n\\nKill about 6,000 jobs in Alabama’s 7th District alone. Nationwide, a default could kill more than 7 million jobs.\\nJeopardize Social Security payments for 101,000 families in Alabama’s 7th District.\\nPut health benefits at risk for 306,000 people in Alabama’s 7th District who rely on Medicare, Medicaid, or Veterans Affairs health coverage.\\nIncrease lifetime mortgage costs for the typical homeowner in Alabama by $43,000.\\nRaise the costs of a new car loan for the typical American by $800.\\nThreaten the retirement savings of 91,400 people near retirement in Alabama’s 7th District, eliminating $20,000 from the typical retirement portfolio.\\n\\nRep. Sewell and her Democratic colleagues made clear that while they welcome debate on spending and economic responsibility, negotiations over spending must be distinct from the threat of economic default, and any cuts to Social Security and Medicare are off the table.\\nThe full text of the letter can be found here.\",\n",

Claudia Tenney (NY-24), Danny Davis (IL-07), and Mike Kelly (PA-16) in introducing the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Extension Act. This legislation would spur investment and economic growth in Alabama’s rural and underserved communities by making the NMTC a permanent fixture of our tax code.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSet to expire on December 31, 2025, the New Markets Tax Credit was established in the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000, and is an essential source of financing for businesses and community facilities in low-income and rural areas across the country. The NMTC provides private investors with a 39 percent credit against federal income taxes for investments made in some of the most distressed communities in the nation. This bill makes the NMTC a permanent part of the Internal Revenue Code, indexes allocation levels to inflation in future years, and exempts NMTC investments from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).\\xa0\\n“In Alabama’s 7th Congressional District, we have seen firsthand the power of the New Markets Tax Credit to spur investment and incentivize economic growth in some of our most vulnerable and underserved communities,”\\xa0said Rep. Sewell.\\xa0“The New Markets Tax Credit remains a critical tool to promote job creation and provide opportunities to those who need them most. We must ensure that this tool is made a permanent part of our tax code, and that’s exactly what this legislation would do.”\\n“Now more than ever, it is essential that we work to create investments in our rural and low-income communities,”\\xa0said Rep. Tenney, lead Republican sponsor.\\xa0“Rural America is often forgotten by the Washington elites, which means that rural communities sometimes lack the necessary resources to invest, grow, and expand. Congress must make the New Markets Tax Credit permanent to allow our rural communities to continue accessing this important resource which helps to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. As a small business owner from rural America, I will always be a tenacious advocate for investments in our rural communities and businesses in Congress.”\\n“Over the years, the New Markets Tax Credit has well-proven its worth by revitalizing neighborhoods and cities that need the help the most,”\\xa0said Rep. Kelly.\\xa0“The New Markets Tax Credit Extension (NMTC) Act would allow more communities across the country to receive the benefits that I have seen firsthand in my district, including 518 new jobs from three projects in Northwestern Pennsylvania. Since the program’s inception, the NMTC has created over 24,000 permanent jobs and 27,000 construction across Pennsylvania. Along with revitalizing American’s Main Streets, the NMTC program is a job creator and I’m proud to support this legislation again in the 118th Congress!”\\n“The New Markets Tax Credit has been and remains absolutely vital for many of America’s urban neighborhoods and rural communities and will provide billions of dollars for high-impact, community revitalization projects,”\\xa0said Bob Rapoza, spokesperson for the NMTC Coalition.\\xa0“Over the years, the credit has been instrumental in financing plant and equipment for small manufacturing businesses and patient, flexible capital to other small businesses, hospitals, healthcare centers, homeless shelters and other transformative projects that improve communities, create jobs and economic opportunity. We appreciate the leadership of Representatives Tenney and Sewell in promoting more investment in distressed communities.”\\n“We commend Representatives Tenney and Sewell for leading the way to make the New Markets Tax Credit a permanent part of the tax code. It is one of the most concrete steps the 118th Congress could take to spur investment in economically distressed communities—from rural towns to urban neighborhoods, and everywhere in between,”\\xa0said Lori Chatman, Interim co-CEO, Enterprise Community Partners.\\xa0“This proposal is a bipartisan opportunity to add stability and efficiency to a program that has already delivered $120 billion in community assets and created more than 1 million jobs nationwide, including NMTCs Enterprise recently provided to finance the GLOW Healthy Living Campus in Batavia, New York.”\\nAdditional cosponsors include Rep.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) introduced the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act of 2023. This bipartisan legislation would combat the nation’s physician shortage and improve access to health care by expanding the number of Medicare-supported medical residency positions by 14,000 over seven years.\\n“In Alabama and all across the nation, we are facing an urgent physician shortage that will only get worse as our population continues to age,” said Rep. Sewell, lead sponsor. “By adding 14,000 new graduate medical education residency positions over the next seven years, this critical legislation will give hospitals and health centers the tools they need to improve access to care, lower wait times for patients, and create a pipeline of qualified medical professionals to serve Americans’ health needs.”\\n“In the face of a severe physician shortage, it is more important than ever to have highly-trained doctors in our hospitals,” said Rep. Fitzpatrick, lead Republican sponsor. “The bipartisan Resident Physician Shortage Act will create more opportunities for aspiring doctors to join residency programs and help meet the growing demand for high-quality health care.”\\nAccording to data from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), the United States faces a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034, with demand for physicians outpacing supply. The nation’s demographics—particularly population growth and aging—serve as the primary driver of increasing demand for physician services. As the population continues to age and requires more medical care, it is critical to ensure there are enough physicians to care for those who need physician services. In addition, as a large portion of the physician workforce nears traditional retirement age, there is a critical need to educate and train more physicians to ensure there are enough physicians to care for patients across all communities in the future.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The residency positions in the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act are a critical step in working to address the nation’s dire physician shortage,” said Association of American Medical Colleges President and CEO David J. Skorton, MD. “We thank Reps. Sewell and Fitzpatrick for their dedication to ensuring access to high-quality health care for all by expanding critical investments in physician training. By strategically targeting these new medical residency positions at a wide variety of teaching hospitals, we are also strengthening and diversifying the health care workforce and improving critical access to care for patients, families, and communities across the country.”\\n“Hospitals are emerging from the pandemic with the dual crises of soaring inflation and a worsening labor shortage,” said Greater New York Hospital Association President Kenneth E. Raske. “The time to reinvest in our physician workforce is now. GNYHA strongly supports this important bill, which tackles the physician shortage head-on by adding 14,000 Medicare-funded graduate medical education slots. The teaching hospital community thanks Representatives Sewell and Fitzpatrick for their leadership on this vital issue.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'Bipartisan, bicameral Retirement Savings for Americans Act would make saving for retirement reliable, real, and attainable for American workers\\nWashington, D.C.\\xa0— Today, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Lloyd Smucker (PA-11) introduced H.R. 9462, the\\xa0Retirement Savings for Americans Act, a bipartisan, bicameral bill to improve retirement security and financial well-being for low- and middle-income American workers. Specifically, the bill would establish a new program that gives eligible workers access to portable, tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts. It would also offer federal matching contributions for low- and middle-income workers, with the match beginning to phase out at median income. Companion legislation was introduced by Sens. John Hickenlooper (D-CO) and Thom Tillis (R-NC) in the U.S. Senate.\\n“Every Alabamian and every American should be able to retire with dignity after a lifetime of work,”\\xa0said Rep. Sewell. “This critical, bipartisan legislation would address serious gaps in our retirement system and make it easier for low- and middle-income workers to save for retirement. I was proud to work with my House and Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance this commonsense bill which would level the playing field for working families and build a stronger economy for all Americans.”\\n“I appreciate the opportunity to advance meaningful bipartisan legislation to assist hardworking Americans save for their retirement,”\\xa0said Rep. Lloyd Smucker.\\xa0“Our legislation, the Retirement Savings for Americans Act, will create a pathway for millions of Americans to find financial security in their retirement. I look forward to continuing to advance this legislation in the next Congress and building upon the successes of SECURE 2.0 to help Americans become financially secure in their retirements.”\\n“Too many Americans are working their entire adult lives only to reach retirement and find they don’t have enough saved,”\\xa0said Sen. Hickenlooper.\\xa0“Helping people save is an easy, efficient way to cut income inequality while making sure all workers get the retirement they’ve earned.”\\n“Roughly 40 million Americans lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, which represents a significant roadblock to achieving financial security for their retirement,”\\xa0said Sen. Tillis.\\xa0“The Retirement Savings for Americans Act tackles this real problem by establishing a pathway for savings for Americans lacking retirement options.”\\nAround\\xa0one-third\\xa0of private-sector workers lack access to a workplace retirement plan, and roughly half of households\\xa0are at risk\\xa0of taking a cut to their standard of living in retirement.\\nThe bill contains the following provisions:\\n\\nEligibility and Auto Enrollment:\\xa0Full- and part-time workers who lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan would be eligible for an account, and they would be automatically enrolled at 3% of their income. They could choose to increase or decrease their withholding, or opt out entirely at any time. Independent workers (including gig workers) would also be eligible.\\nFederal Contribution: Low- and moderate-income workers would be eligible for a 1% automatic contribution (as long as they remain employed) and up to a 4% matching contribution via a refundable federal tax credit. This would begin to phase out at median income.\\nPortability: Accounts would remain attached to workers throughout their lifetimes, and workers would be able to stop and start contributions at will.\\nPrivate Assets: The accounts would be the property of the worker and the assets could be passed down to future generations to help them build wealth and financial security.\\nInvestment Options: Much like the current TSP, participants would be given a menu of simple, low-fee investment options to choose from, including lifecycle funds tied to a worker’s estimated retirement date, or index funds made of stocks and bonds.\\n\\n“Far too many Americans are unprepared for retirement. The Retirement Savings for Americans Act would tackle serious gaps in the U.S. retirement system that have hindered millions of workers from saving for a more certain and secure future,”\\xa0said Economic Innovation Group (EIG) President and CEO John Lettieri.\\xa0“By incorporating a range of proven features, this innovative legislation would greatly expand market access to high quality retirement plans and target savings incentives to workers who need them most. The result would be a healthier retirement system, a more secure workforce, and a stronger economy to the benefit of all Americans. EIG applauds Senators Hickenlooper and Tillis and Representatives Sewell and Smucker for their bipartisan dedication to empowering American workers.”\\nFull text of the bill is available\\xa0here.',\n",

This funding is part of a $1.66 billion investment by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in 150 bus fleets and facilities across the nation to reduce pollution and meet President Biden’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. This year\\'s funding alone will nearly double the number of no-emission transit buses on America\\'s roadways. In Alabama, this funding will improve safety and reliability of transit services for residents of the Birmingham and Tuscaloosa regions while reducing pollution and advancing environmental justice.\\nThe Birmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority (BJCTA) will receive $13,654,636 to build a new maintenance facility and buy compressed natural gas, hydrogen fuel-cell and battery electric buses and charging equipment. This project and the new vehicles will improve the safety and reliability of transit service for residents in Jefferson County.\\nThe University of Alabama will receive $7,890,065 to replace diesel buses with new electric buses, buy charging equipment, and train maintenance workers to support the new electric bus fleet. The project will ensure continued service reliability, maintain a state of good repair, improve air quality, and advance environmental justice in the Tuscaloosa community.\\n“It’s hard to overstate the transformational impact that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is having here in Alabama,” said Rep. Sewell. “Once again, we’re seeing much-needed funding coming to our communities to upgrade our infrastructure, connect our communities, and clean up our environment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a true testament to what we can achieve when we put people over politics, and I was proud to be the only Member of Congress from Alabama to support it.”\\n“With this announcement, we’re bringing millions of dollars to Jefferson County for brand new vehicles and a new maintenance facility to keep them running smoothly,” continued Sewell. “That means safer and more reliable bus services for the residents of the Birmingham region. For our University of Alabama campus community, this announcement means better, greener buses and a cleaner, healthier environment.”\\nThese two projects were among 150 to be selected by the FTA out of a pool of more than 530 eligible proposals. The bus grant awards—made under FTA\\'s Buses and Bus Facilitiesand Low- and No-Emission Vehicle programs—are FTA\\'s first competitive grant selections under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

       "  'date': 'August 12, 2022',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, a historic legislative package that will tackle inflation, drive down health care and energy costs, cut the deficit, and make the largest investment to combat climate change in United States history. The bill is fully paid for by making the wealthiest corporations begin to pay their fair share. Included in the bill is Rep. Sewell’s climate justice legislation to reduce pollution and promote carbon capture technology. The Inflation Reduction Act passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 220-207 with every Democrat voting in favor of this significant legislation. Having passed the Senate last Sunday, the bill now heads to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.\\n“With passage of the historic Inflation Reduction Act, Congressional Democrats have once again delivered a major victory for the American people, the State of Alabama, and our planet!” said Rep. Sewell. “This bill caps drug costs for Alabama seniors and extends critical health care subsidies to drive down costs for families, all without raising taxes on anyone making under $400,000 per year. Instead, this bill is fully paid for by making the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share.”\\n“The Inflation Reduction Act also marks a major turning point in our fight to advance environmental justice, reduce pollution, and combat climate change,” continued Sewell. “I was proud to see that my bill, the Carbon Capture and Sequestration Expansion Act, was included in the climate title of this bill. While my colleagues on the other side spread falsehoods to protect billion-dollar corporations and special interests, I’m proud that my Democratic colleagues and I once again came together to deliver legislation that puts people over politics. I know this legislation will make a world of difference for so many Alabama families.”\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act takes bold action to lower health care costs and slash prescription drug costs for Alabamians. By extending the Affordable Care Act enhanced subsidies that are set to expire in January 2023 for three more years, the Inflation Reduction Act locks in lower health care premiums for 209,000 Alabamians who will save an average of $800 annually per person. It also empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prices for about 100 high cost, single-source drugs over the next decade. For Medicare beneficiaries, the bill caps out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 annually and caps the cost of insulin at $35 per month. Under this bill, if drug companies raise prices in Medicare faster than the rate of inflation, they are required to pay rebates back to Medicare for the difference, beginning in October 2022.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act is the largest investment to fight climate change, clean up pollution, and advance environmental justice in U.S. history. The bill’s $370 billion in climate resiliency investments would reduce U.S. carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030, and its $60 billion in environmental justice priorities will drive investments into disadvantaged communities. Notably, thanks to a provision cosponsored by Rep. Sewell, the bill reinstates the Superfund tax on crude oil and petroleum products to ensure that Superfund sites like the one in North Birmingham have the resources needed for environmental cleanup. The bill also includes Sewell’s climate justice legislation, the Carbon Capture and Sequestration Expansion Act, to reduce pollution and promote carbon capture technology.\\nContrary to Republican falsehoods, the Inflation Reduction Act contains no new taxes on families making $400,000 or less and no new taxes on small businesses. The bill is fully paid for by strengthening IRS enforcement against wealthy tax cheats, closing tax loopholes exploited by the wealthiest few, and implementing a 15% corporate minimum tax—which applies only to the 150 corporations earning over $1 billion in profits. Thanks to these provisions, the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to reduce the deficit by over $300 billion over the next decade.\\nThe Inflation Reduction Act enjoys bipartisan support from the American people, as well as a wide range of experts, climate activists, labor unions, business leaders and advocacy organizations. Over 7 in 10 voters overwhelmingly back the Inflation Reduction Act, including 95 percent of Democrats, nearly three-quarters of independents, and more than half of Republicans, according to a recent poll by Data for Progress.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted for historic, bipartisan legislation to strengthen Alabama families’ financial future, boost America’s research advantage and safeguard our economic and national security for generations to come. The CHIPS and Science Act will deliver a powerful investment in America’s global competitiveness—creating jobs, slashing kitchen table costs, ending dependence on foreign manufacturers, and turbocharging American innovation. The bill passed the House today by a vote of 243 to 187. Previously passed by the Senate, this legislation now heads to the President’s desk to be signed into law.\\n“The CHIPS and Science Act is a victory for Alabama and our nation!” said Rep. Sewell. “This major legislation is all about ensuring that America remains a world leader in science, technology, and innovation. By turbocharging our production of semiconductors, the CHIPS and Science Act will strengthen American manufacturing, lower costs, and bolster our independence from foreign suppliers, all while creating good-paying jobs here at home. I’m also thrilled that this bill will bring research investments to our local communities to help diversify our STEM workforce. I look forward to seeing President Biden sign it into law!”\\nA nationwide shortage of semiconductor chips has severely disrupted American manufacturing,\\xa0 slowing down production, spiking prices and increasing dependence on unfriendly foreign nations. Only 12 percent of semiconductor chips are currently manufactured domestically—a dramatic drop from 37 percent in the 1990s—while foreign competitors are investing heavily to dominate this critical national security industry. Other nations have also begun to outpace the United States’ research advantage, threatening American preeminence in technology and scientific innovation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act will reverse these dangerous trends, reasserting America’s economic independence and scientific dominance. Thanks to the strong leadership of House Democrats, this legislation:\\n\\nLowers costs for American consumers – by making more critical semiconductor components in America, helping end the shortage of chips that have driven up the price of everything from cars to consumer goods.\\nCreates 100,000 new good-paying jobs – creates strong Davis-Bacon jobs building hi-tech manufacturing facilities here in America.\\nEnds our dangerous dependence on foreign manufacturers – bringing critical semiconductor manufacturing back to America instead of overseas where it can be threatened by our adversaries.\\nTurbocharges American R&D – powering America’s preeminence in both basic research and next-generation technologies and ensuring that the technologies of the future are made here in America.\\nDiversifies and expands the innovation workforce – broadening the pool of brainpower and talent so that we are embracing the full potential from all our communities, helping to diversify our STEM workforce and advancing regional technology hubs to ensure communities across the country can help in American research and development.\\n\\nThis legislation also includes strong guardrails to ensure that federal semiconductor investments go straight into Alabama’s economy—not corporate pockets or unfriendly nations. The CHIPS and Science Act will:\\n\\nProhibit companies from using chips funding for stock buybacks or dividend payments.\\nBar funding recipients from expanding semiconductor manufacturing in countries of concern.\\nRequire strong oversight and tight Congressional control over the use of federal funds.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to invest in Alabama families and the American economy with government funding legislation for Fiscal Year 2023. This legislation will support our neighbors and families, create good-paying jobs, and protect Alabamians’ health and well-being. Within this package, Rep. Sewell secured millions in funding for local community projects in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. It will now make its way to the U.S. Senate.\\n“This government funding package invests in Alabama families and advances many of the priorities that Alabamians value most, creating good-paying jobs, improving our infrastructure, and bolstering our economy,” said Rep. Sewell. “I’m so proud to have helped secure millions of dollars in funding for local projects in our district! The funding for these projects responds directly to the needs of our communities, which is why I fought so hard for its inclusion. It is my hope that the Senate will swiftly approve this funding and send it to President Biden’s desk.”\\nRep. Sewell secured funding for the following local community projects in the FY2023 government funding which passed the House today:\\n\\n$4,000,000 for Blight Removal in Montgomery - The funding would be used to redevelop blighted properties within the City of Montgomery with the intention to revitalize neighborhoods that have historically seen a lack of investment opportunities.\\n$4,000,000 for the Selma Riverfront Multi-Plex - The funding would be used to acquire, redevelop and construct a center for essential public safety services accessible for all members of the community.\\n$4,000,000 for the Birmingham Valley Creek Rails to Trails Project - The funding would be used to redevelop and construct a 4.57-mile recreation and transportation project for low-income city residents.\\n$500,000 for the Town of Orrville Public Library - The funding would be used for the construction of a new municipal public library providing access to educational resources for a historically underserved community.\\n$750,000 for the Bethel Baptist Church Family and Child Center - The funding would be used to construct a multi-purpose community center providing child care and educational support for youth & families in a neighborhood that has experienced economic hardship and overall lack of investment for decades.\\n$1,500,000 for the Historic Brown Chapel AME Church Restoration - The funding would be used to stabilize the structure of the building to allow for further restoration of the sanctuary, bell towers, and brickwork. This much needed restoration is important because the church is a significant part of the Civil Rights movement story.\\n$6,800,000 for a F-35 Weapons Load Crew Training Facility at the Montgomery Regional Airport Base - The funding would be used to construct a Weapons Load Crew Training facility utilizing conventional design and construction methods to accommodate the mission of the facility. This arrangement will improve the ability to train weapons load crews and certify their continued readiness.\\n$15,000,000 for a Commercial Vehicle Inspection Gate at Maxwell Air Force Base - The funding would be used to construct a commercial vehicle inspection and entry control facility area. This project will provide perimeter protection and security of Air Force personnel and assets, prevent unauthorized access, and maximize traffic flow.\\n\\nAs a whole, this government funding package will secure critical investments in a range of key priorities for Alabama communities:\\n\\nCreating Good-Paying Jobs by upgrading Alabama’s roads, bridges, public transit, rail, airports and water infrastructure.\\nCombating the Climate Crisis by expanding renewable energy, strengthening local resilience against extreme weather and spurring new, innovative technology.\\nBolstering Alabama Health and Economic Security by investing in federal nutrition programs, Alabama small businesses, stronger consumer protection and expanded affordable housing.\\nHonoring our Service Members by investing in VA health care, military housing, child care for military families and mental health services.\\nStrengthening our Nation’s Food Supply by supporting Alabama farmers, expanding agricultural research and investing in land conservation.\\xa0\\n\\nInterior and Environment\\n\\n$171 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, including $28 million for competitive Grants to preserve the sites and stories of underrepresented communities, and $10 million for grants to HBCUs.\\n$65 million for ten new grant programs authorized in the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act, including $5 million for the new Decentralized Wastewater Grant Program.\\n$11.5 billion for the EPA, including $126 million to advance work related to PFAS, $5.18 billion for State and Tribal Assistance Grants, and $301 million for Environmental Justice.\\n\\nTransportation and Housing and Urban Development\\n\\n$62.7 billion for HUD, including an expansion of housing choice vouchers to more than 140,000 individuals and families experiencing or at risk of homelessness and 5,600 new units for seniors and persons with disabilities\\n$105.4 billion in budgetary resources for DOT, which will create and sustain tens of thousands of good-paying American jobs rebuilding our crumbling transportation infrastructure\\nMore than $2.6 billion to reduce emissions, increase resiliency, and address historical inequities in transportation and housing programs.\\xa0\\n\\nAgriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug Administration\\n\\n$560 billion for the expansion of broadband service\\n$30 billion in loan authority for the Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program\\nMore than $1.5 billion for rental assistance and affordable rental housing vouchers for low-income families and the elderly in rural communities\\n$111.2 billion in required mandatory spending for SNAP, including $3 billion for the SNAP reserve fund, which will serve more than 43.5 million people\\n$3.6 billion in discretionary funding to the FDA to combat the opioid crisis, stem food outbreaks, and address heavy metals in baby food\\n\\nEnergy and Water Development\\n\\n$4 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy\\n$350 million to advance technologies to increase resiliency, efficiency, and clean energy capabilities of the nation’s electricity delivery system\\n$100 million to accelerate domestic manufacturing of key clean energy technologies\\n$10.8 billion for the nation’s water infrastructure\\n\\nFinancial Services and General Government\\n\\n$326 billion for Entrepreneurial Development Programs at the Small Business Administration\\n$336 million for Community Development Financial Institutions, including $10 million to increase the availability and affordability of small dollar loans\\n$400 million for Election Security Grants to augment State efforts to improve the security and integrity of elections for Federal office\\n\\nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs\\n\\n$15.1 billion for military construction, including $274.4 million for Child Development Centers, $2.1 billion for Family Housing, and $135 million for Climate Change and Resiliency Projects\\n$135 billion in discretionary funds for VA, including $13.9 billion for mental health care, $911.1 million for Gender-specific Care and Programmatic Efforts for Women, and $2.7 billion for Homeless Assistance Programs.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined Mayor Randall Woodfin to welcome U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg to Birmingham, Alabama. During his visit, Secretary Buttigieg announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is now accepting applications for the first-of-its-kind Reconnecting Communities program. Created by President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the $1 billion pilot program will help reconnect communities that were previously cut off from economic opportunities by transportation infrastructure. As the only member of Alabama’s congressional delegation to vote in favor of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Sewell fought to ensure that equity was a central focus of the legislation.\\nThursday morning, Rep. Sewell hosted a roundtable discussion with Secretary Buttigieg, Mayor Woodfin, and community stakeholders to give local officials the opportunity to speak directly with federal leaders. They then embarked on a bus tour to give the Secretary a firsthand look at the Birmingham Xpress Bus Rapid Transit service, a program that will soon connect residents from 25 communities to jobs, schools, and healthcare.\\xa0\\n“I think it’s critically important that we bring together our local and federal officials for a chance to speak directly about the needs of those we serve,” said Rep. Sewell.“Conversations like these really help strengthen our partnership on behalf of the people of the 7th Congressional District and move our communities forward.”\\nRep. Sewell joined Secretary Buttigieg and Mayor Woodfin for a press conference announcing the new Reconnecting Communities Program, a $1 billion, first-of-its-kind initiative from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law dedicated to reconnecting communities that were previously cut off from economic opportunities by highways and other transportation infrastructure. Reconnecting a community could mean adapting existing infrastructure—such as building a pedestrian walkway over or under an existing highway—to better connect neighborhoods to opportunities or better means of access such as crosswalks and redesigned intersections.\\n“The Reconnecting Communities program will help right the wrongs of our past by connecting\\xa0neighborhoods that were previously divided by highways and other infrastructure,” continued Sewell. “This is about making sure that people can live where they want to live more affordably while accessing the jobs, schools, and services our city has to offer. I applaud Secretary Buttigieg and the entire Biden-Harris Administration for making these investments which harness the power of transportation infrastructure to connect our communities and build a more equitable future.”\\n\"Transportation can connect us to jobs, services, and loved ones, but we‘ve also seen countless cases around the country where a piece of infrastructure cuts off a neighborhood or a community because of how it was built,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. \"Using funds from President Biden\\'s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are proud to announce the launch of Reconnecting Communities: the first-ever dedicated federal initiative to unify neighborhoods living with the impacts of past infrastructure choices that divided them.\"\\nSecretary Buttigieg also visited the 16th Street Baptist Church to connect with other community leaders and learn about the church’s history and role in catalyzing the Civil Rights Movement.\\nFor more information about the Reconnecting Communities program, click here.

       "  'text': \"Thomasville, AL – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) continued her Congress in Your Community Tour in Thomasville, Alabama. Rep. Sewell began by visiting Thomasville’s Westervelt Lumber Mill where she toured the facility and spoke with employees during a town hall event. She then toured the Thomasville Regional Medical Center and met with the facility's leadership to help address their urgent funding needs.\\nAfter arriving at Westervelt Lumber’s Thomasville Mill, Rep. Sewell spoke with the facility's employees during a town hall event and provided an update on her bipartisan legislation, the Disaster Reforestation Act, which would help the lumber industry recover following a natural disaster. Sewell then toured the facility for a firsthand look at Westervelt’s work which serves customers across the United States.\\n“I know just how critical the timber industry is to Alabama’s 7th Congressional District and to the State of Alabama,” said Rep. Sewell. “I want to thank Westervelt Lumber for bringing jobs, opportunities, and investments right here to our Clarke County community.”\\xa0\\n“I also know companies like Westervelt face an immense financial burden when natural disasters damage our forests,” continued Sewell. “We must ensure that our tax code allows businesses to recover when disaster strikes, which is why I’m proud to be leading the bipartisan Disaster Reforestation Act in the House of Representatives. This bill would provide needed relief to this critical industry, allowing companies to claim losses of uncut timber from fire, storms, insects, invasive species, drought, or theft.”\\n“The Westervelt Company was pleased to welcome Congresswoman Sewell to our Thomasville Lumber facility today,” said Westervelt President and CEO Brian Luoma. “We appreciate her support on issues important to our industry, including the benefits of managed forests and the economic impact to our local communities.”\\nFollowing her stop at Westervelt Lumber, Sewell visited the Thomasville Regional Medical Center where she met with hospital officials about how she can best support efforts to keep the hospital open. For months, Rep. Sewell has been strongly advocating for critically-needed federal support to address the hospital’s urgent financial situation. During today’s visit, she reiterated her commitment to supporting the hospital which serves as a critical resource for those living in the Black Belt.\\n“The residents of Thomasville, Clarke County, and the Black Belt depend on the Thomasville Regional Medical Center for lifesaving care,” said Rep.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Sewell (AL-07) voted to reauthorize the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), legislation that will help unleash the full potential of Alabama’s workforce by ensuring Alabamians have the skills they need to succeed. Amid the strongest job growth in modern times, these investments will connect Alabamians to a record number of job openings—bringing workers off the sidelines, increasing production, and lowering the cost of key goods.\\n“Today, I proudly voted to invest in Alabama’s workforce, which is the cornerstone of economic growth and prosperity in our state,” said Rep. Sewell. “By fully funding our federal workforce development system, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will deliver high-quality job training and empower Alabamians to take advantage of record job growth we’re experiencing under President Biden. By getting people in jobs, this legislation will help bolster Alabama’s manufacturing base and lower costs for hardworking Alabama families.”\\xa0\\nWIOA makes up the heart of the United States’ workforce development system, but its Congressional authorization has not been renewed since lapsing in 2020. Additionally, while the U.S. labor force has grown by roughly half over the past four decades, federal workforce development spending has fallen by two thirds. This funding gap means that essential job training services are frequently unavailable to Alabamians who need them most.\\nToday’s reauthorization fully funds WIOA for six years, allowing the workforce development system to train one million American workers per year by 2028. Additionally, it further expands pathways to opportunity by strengthening the Job Corps program, supporting summer and year-round jobs programs for young people and establishing a new employment program for formerly incarcerated Americans. By helping fill a record number of job openings, these workforce development investments will power the economy and lower costs for working families.\\xa0\\nIn order to further address good shortages and rising prices, the House passed the America COMPETES Act earlier this year. This legislation will deliver transformative investments to strengthen the United States’ broken supply chains, reinvigorate American manufacturing and boost production across key industries. The Congress is now working to deliver a final bipartisan, bicameral supply chain package to the President’s desk.',\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that the greater Birmingham region will receive over $4.2 million in grant funding from the United States Department of Labor (DOL) for job training and educational opportunities for at-risk youth. This funding, which was awarded through DOL’s YouthBuild program, will be used to support the development of apprenticeship and other career pathway models that prepare at-risk youth for jobs in construction and other in-demand industries, especially clean energy. The awards are part of a $90 million investment by the Biden-Harris Administration to grow America’s clean energy workforce with education and training for young adults.\\nThe following organizations were named as recipients of DOL’s YouthBuild grant program:\\n\\nBessemer Housing Authority - $1,500,000\\nHousing Authority of Birmingham District (HABD) - $1,500,000\\nCornerstone Revitalization Foundation - $1,259,237\\n\\n“I’m thrilled that the greater Birmingham region will be receiving over $4.2 million from the Department of Labor!” said Rep. Sewell. “This announcement is truly a win-win for our community. By connecting at-risk youth with job training and education, this funding will provide our most vulnerable young adults with the resources they need to succeed, all while growing our green energy workforce. Once again, I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration for making transformational investments in our community!”\\xa0\\n“We are delighted to be awarded the Department of Labor YouthBuild Grant to help provide the youth of Bessemer, Alabama with additional resources, furthering their education and preparing them to become productive citizens in our community,” said Courtney Coleman, Executive Director of the Bessemer Housing Authority. “We believe these funds along with our community partners will work together to ‘Build Better Lives’ and ‘Deliver Hope’, which is the mission here at the Bessemer Housing Authority.”\\n“This is a monumental win for our agency,” said HABD Board Chairman Dr. Anthony Hood. “This award allows us to equip our most promising youth with the tools needed to thrive in an ever-competitive workforce. The demand for skilled trades and apprenticeships has never been stronger, and this grant allows us to place our young people on a direct path to the careers of the future.\"\\n“Often, when a child drops out of school, society takes it as a sign that they have given up hope that life can get any better for them. This grant allows us to seek out those youth and give that hope back to them,” said HABD Interim President and CEO Dontrelle Young Foster. “With this award, HABD can prepare residents for quality jobs and promote the attainment of skills necessary for success in this knowledge-based economy. This is a win not only for the clients we serve at HABD but also for the entire City of Birmingham. \"\\nFollowing its Nov. 23, 2021 announcement of available funding, DOL awarded 68 grants—ranging from $700,000 to $1.5 million—to organizations in 28 states and Puerto Rico to deliver job training and employment services. Participants will engage in classroom learning that will prepare them for work-based learning opportunities building and rehabilitating affordable housing for low-income or homeless families in their communities.\\nParticipants will split their time between workplace training and the classroom, where they will earn a high school diploma or equivalent degree to prepare for postsecondary opportunities.\\nAdministered by the department\\'s Employment and Training Administration, the latest YouthBuild grants complement the Biden-Harris administration\\'s workforce priorities to advance equitable career pathway opportunities, quality jobs and climate sustainability by supporting programs that provide construction skills focused on green building techniques, including understanding sustainable building materials, solar panel installation, weatherization processes and the use of Energy Star appliances. These announcements will also further President Biden\\'s Justice40 Initiative that commits to delivering at least 40 percent of the benefits from federal climate and clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities.\\nFor the first time, the YouthBuild funding opportunity announcement included criteria that awarded bonus points for applicants that demonstrated their ability to provide training in green construction techniques, training the next generation of workers for resilience and clean energy careers of the future.\\nYouthBuild programs also train young people for employment in healthcare, information technology, manufacturing and logistics, culinary arts, and hospitality.\\nLearn more about the YouthBuild program.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to secure urgently needed relief for small businesses across Alabama. H.R. 3807, the Relief for Restaurants & Other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act, will deliver $55 billion to replenish relief funding for restaurants and establish a new program supporting other small businesses impacted by the pandemic. The bill passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 223-203.\\n“Small businesses are the lifeblood of Alabama’s economy,” said Rep. Sewell. “Today, House Democrats are once again taking action to support small businesses that were hit hardest by the pandemic. The Restaurant Revitalization Fund, which we created in the historic American Rescue Plan, has served as a lifeline for Alabama’s restaurants and small businesses, providing over $150 million in relief. Today’s legislation builds on our progress with additional funding for these establishments to ensure they can continue to reopen, recover, and rehire. As we build a better Alabama, I will continue to make supporting our small businesses a top priority!”\\nThe Relief for Restaurants & Other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act delivers critical assistance to small businesses in three ways:\\n\\nReplenishes the Restaurant Revitalization Fund to rescue struggling establishments - Established through Democrats’ American Rescue Plan, which Sewell helped pass, the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) distributed $28.6 billion to restaurants across the country – including $154,096,761 for 866 small businesses in Alabama. Due to its popularity, the program quickly exhausted its funding before more than 170,000 eligible businesses could access relief. The Relief for Restaurants & Other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act will provide $42 billion to replenish the RRF so that these restaurants can apply for this assistance.\\xa0\\nHelps ensure that the hardest hit small businesses don’t get left out - H.R. 3807 provides $13 billion to establish the new Hard Hit Industries Award Program, an SBA initiative to assist small businesses from across industries that were hardest hit by the pandemic and lost revenue but were not eligible for other grants or awards. Businesses eligible for these grants would have 200 or fewer employees and have experienced 40 percent or more in lost revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nProvides much-needed flexibility to theaters, performing arts centers, and other venues to expend relief funds - The bill amends the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant Program by extending the timeframe that current award recipients are required to incur expenses and expend grant funds\\n\\nThis legislation is paid for responsibly and is funded in part by transferring funds that are reclaimed, seized, or returned to the Federal Government primarily from bad actors attempting to defraud prior small business pandemic relief funds including the Paycheck Protection Program, Shuttered Venue Operators Grant Program, COVID EIDL loans and others.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) lauded the passage of the Securing a Strong Retirement Act—also known as the SECURE Act 2.0—in the House of Representatives. This robust retirement savings package, which passed yesterday by a bipartisan vote of 414-5, includes H.R. 2944, a bill that Sewell introduced to make it easier for part-time workers to start contributing to their employer’s 401k plan. Sewell’s bill incentivizes saving by reducing the number of years of service required for part-time workers to make retirement contributions. As women are more likely to work part-time than men, this provision is particularly impactful for women in the workforce.\\n“We know that Alabama’s working families are facing a retirement crisis,” said Rep. Sewell. “Too often, incentives to save are designed to benefit the wealthy and the upper-middle class, leaving many families without adequate savings even after a lifetime of work. My bill addresses this fundamental inequity in our tax code by rebalancing incentives to save and making it easier for part-time workers to save sooner in their careers. I’m thrilled that this bill passed the House and will continue to advance policies that ensure all working people can retire with dignity and financial security!”\\nH.R. 2944, the Reducing the Maximum Service Requirement for Long-term Part-time Workers to Make Elective Deferrals to 401(k) Plans Act, amends the long-term part-time years of service 401(k) participation requirement included in the 2019 SECURE Act. The SECURE Act provides that except in the case of collectively bargained plans, employers maintaining a 401(k) plan must have a dual eligibility requirement under which an employee must complete either a one year of service requirement (with the 1,000-hour rule) or three consecutive years of service where the employee completes at least 500 hours of service. H.R. 2944 reduces the three-year rule to two years, allowing for part-time employees to begin saving for retirement sooner.\\nH.R. 2944 can be found here.',\n",

These programs include Community Facilities Direct Loans and Grants, Community Facilities Loan Guarantees, Community Facilities Technical Assistance Training Grants, Community Facilities Disaster Grants, and Economic Impact Initiative Grants. The projects will finance emergency response vehicles and equipment; build or improve hospitals and clinics and help fund other essential community facilities.

Sewell. “However, the Edmund Pettus Bridge and the buildings in Downtown Selma adjacent to the Alabama river are under threat from the severe river erosion caused by multiple natural disasters. Thanks to our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, $803,000 is soon headed to Selma.”\\xa0\\nWith these new federal funds from the Army Corps, officials will be able to complete preconstruction engineering and design of the stabilization project and ultimately expedite completion of the project.\\nThe Biden Administration announced yesterday that the Army Corps of Engineers will invest $14 billion in 500 projects across the nation that focus on strengthening critical supply chains.\\xa0 Due to decades of underinvestment, and accelerating climate threats, supply chains have struggled to keep pace with the strong economic recovery – burdening families and businesses with added costs and delay.\\xa0These new investments will create jobs and economic opportunity, while strengthening key water infrastructure projects, improving resilience to the climate crisis, and restoring the environment.\\nThe bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed by President Biden on November 15, 2021.',\n",

Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which passed the House in August and is currently sitting in the Senate.\\xa0\\nThe “Building a Better Alabama” Infrastructure District Tour is a series of roundtable discussions, constituency meetings, and site visits throughout Alabama’s 7th Congressional District to connect with constituents and local elected officials and discuss the transformational funding from the $1 trillion bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\\n“Today, I was proud to stop in Choctaw and Clarke counties to discuss this once-in-a-lifetime funding from the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and give a full update on the great things we’ve accomplished in Congress so far this year,” said Rep. Sewell. “As a proud daughter of Alabama’s Black Belt, I know firsthand that with resources and opportunities, our communities can thrive.

Yet 18% of Alabama households do not have an internet subscription, and 11.5% of Alabama residents live in areas where, under the FCC’s benchmark, there is no broadband infrastructure. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Alabama will receive a minimum allocation of $100 million to help provide broadband coverage across the state, including providing access to the at least 565,000 Alabamians who currently lack it. It also makes 1,518,000 Alabamians (31%) eligible for the Affordability Connectivity Benefit, which will help low-income families afford internet access.\\xa0\\nMake Transformational Investments in Alabama’s Water Infrastructure - Currently, up to 10 million American households and 400,000 schools and child care centers lack safe drinking water. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, based on the traditional state revolving fund formula, Alabama will expect to receive $782 million over five years to improve water infrastructure across the state and ensure that clean, safe drinking water is a right in all communities. The bill also includes $23 billion nationally for the bipartisan Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act.\\nImprove Healthy, Sustainable Transportation Options - Alabamians who take public transportation spend an extra 66.2% of their time commuting and non-White households are 4.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation. 25% of transit vehicles in the state are past useful life.

Sewell introduced earlier in the month. On November 3, 2021, nearly every Senate Republican blocked debate on the Senate version of the bill.\\nThis critical legislation would restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and keep the promise of our democracy alive for all Americans. Amid the most coordinated state-level effort to restrict the right to vote in generations, H.R. 4 would prevent states and localities with a recent history of voter discrimination from restricting the right to vote by requiring these jurisdictions to obtain federal preclearance before changing their voting laws.\\nPhotos and videos from today’s events in Butler and Grove Hill can be found here.\\xa0\\nA recording of the “Building a Better Alabama” Infrastructure Town Hall in Grove Hill can be found here.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Selma, AL - Today, Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) applauded Globe Metallurgical Inc. on the re-opening of the silicon plant in Selma, Alabama in January 2022. An allocation from the New Markets Tax Credit Program is also being pursued to enable an expansion of planned capabilities and upgrade of equipment, making the plant more efficient and competitive in the global market.\\xa0\\n“I'm thrilled that Globe Metallurgical Inc. is reopening its silicon metal facility in my hometown of Selma!” said Rep. Sewell. “Manufacturing facilities are economic pillars in our community. I applaud everyone for their continued work in promoting growth and economic opportunity through high-quality jobs to residents in Selma and across the Black Belt.”\\nBackground:\\nThe Selma plant closed in 2018 due to low prices for silicon metal caused by foreign dumping.\\nAs a result of an increased demand and rise of prices, the plant in Selma reopened in November 2021. Globe Metallurgical, Inc. spent millions of dollars refurbishing the plant, aided by the Dallas County Commission and the State of Alabama in preparation for the plant’s reopening in January 2022.Additionally, the company hopes to secure federal New Market Tax Credits, which will enable further investment and an expansion of capabilities in the Selma operation.\\nAt full production, the facility will employ around 100 people in the region and will do business with 150 local suppliers. The two-furnace operation can produce up to 22,000 tons of silicon metal a year. The plant plans to restart the first furnace in January 2022, soon followed by a complete ramp-up to full operational capacity.\\nGlobe Metallurgical, Inc is a subsidiary of Ferroglobe PLC.\\xa0 Ferroglobe is one of the world’s leading suppliers of silicon metal, silicon- and manganese- based specialty alloys, and ferroalloys, serving a customer base across the globe in dynamic and fast-growing end markets, such as solar, semiconductors, automotive, consumer products, construction, and energy.

       "  'text': 'Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (D-AL) joined Reps. Carol Miller (R-WV), Stephanie Murphy (D-FL), and Kevin Hern (R-OK) to introduce the Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) Reinstatement Act. The ERTC was designed to help small businesses rehire and retain employees they had to let go due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was overwhelmingly supported in the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed in March 2020.\\n“From our biggest cities to our rural towns, our nation’s small businesses help our communities thrive,” said Rep. Sewell. “As we build back better from the COVID-19 pandemic and grow our economy, we must make supporting our small business owners a top priority. By reinstating the Employee Retention Tax Credit, this bipartisan bill will provide much needed relief to Alabama’s small businesses, helping them rehire workers lost due to the pandemic. I was proud to join my colleagues in introducing this commonsense legislation and urge swift passage!”\\n“I’m pleased to lead my Ways and Means colleagues in introducing the Employee Retention Tax Credit Reinstatement Act,” said Rep. Carol Miller, lead Republican sponsor. “By reinstating the ERTC, struggling small businesses can access one of the last remaining pandemic recovery programs to receive the help they need to replenish their workforce and get back on track. As we continue to emerge from this public health emergency, we must remember that small businesses in West Virginia and across the country still need our support. I urge Congressional leaders and President Biden to pass our bill into law as soon as possible to give these businesses and employees the certainty they need.”\\n“Over the last year and a half I was proud to lead the bipartisan effort to establish the employee retention tax credit, which provides financial support to businesses who retain or rehire workers, rather than lay them off,” said Rep. Stephanie Murphy, lead Democratic co-sponsor. “This provision has helped thousands of businesses and their workers recover and rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic, and so my fellow Ways and Means colleagues and I are introducing this bipartisan legislation to ensure this program can continue and give small businesses and hardworking Americans the support they need.”\\n“Eliminating the Employee Retention Tax Credit was the wrong decision and hurts our small businesses who are still recovering from the economic fallout of the pandemic. We must provide certainty and predictability to American small business owners. I am proud to join my colleagues in support of this legislation and I hope to earn strong bipartisan support in the House,” said Rep. Kevin Hern, lead Republican co-sponsor.\\nBackground:\\nOriginally, to be eligible for the ERTC, business owners had to demonstrate at least a 20% decline in gross receipts in either a given quarter compared to the same quarter in 2019 or the immediately preceding quarter. Alternatively, the business owner may have been eligible if the business is subject to a full or partial suspension of business operations due to a government order.\\nSpecifically, for this year’s third and fourth quarters, business owners can qualify for the ERTC as a “recovery startup business” or qualify as a “severely financially distressed employer.” To claim the ERTC as a “severely financially distressed employer,” the business must have suffered at least a 90% decline in gross receipts in a specific quarter compared to the same quarter in 2019.\\nMany small businesses have continued to take the tax credit into the fourth quarter, and now face a retroactive tax increase and a complex, frustrating process in reconciling the credit that they will now have to forfeit.',\n",

The Level the Playing Field Act 2.0 would strengthen U.S. trade remedy laws to protect American workers and combat China’s unfair, anti-free market trade practices that distort the global market.\\n“Protecting American workers and countering China’s unfair trade practices must be central pillars of U.S. trade policy,” said Rep. Sewell. “My Level the Playing Field Act 2.0 will support America’s workers by strengthening our trade remedy laws and promoting fair competition by pushing back against China’s egregious efforts to manipulate the global market in their favor. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Congressman Bill Johnson and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give it their full support!”\\n“For far too long, China and its communist regime have taken deliberate steps to hurt American workers and the American economy by dumping steel, aluminum, and other products on the global markets with no repercussions. That must end,” said Rep. Bill Johnson, lead Republican co-sponsor. “This bipartisan legislation will hold China accountable for these actions by ensuring that U.S. industries and the Department of Commerce have the tools needed to seek relief from China’s actions. A robust domestic steel and aluminum industry is critical to repairing America’s aging infrastructure and creating American jobs, the American economy, and American national security. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to ensure this bipartisan bill becomes law.”\\nThe bill is\\xa0 designed to combat many of China’s most egregious practices, such as:\\n\\nCountry Hopping to Escape U.S. Trade Remedies - After all the work of winning an anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) case, relief can be temporary as foreign producers move their factories to other countries to evade the AD/CVD orders.\\xa0Title I of this legislation creates a new successive AD/CVD investigation to combat repeat offenders by making it easier for petitioners to bring new cases when production moves to another country. Title II outlines expedited timelines for successive investigations and factors for the International Trade Commission to consider about the relationship between recently completed trade cases and successive trade cases for the same imported product.\\nBelt and Road Initiative Subsidies - Currently, the Department of Commerce can only consider subsidies provided by the government under investigation. However, with the expansion of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, China is beginning to subsidize production in countries outside of China. Section 201 of this legislation would give Commerce the authority to apply CVD law to subsidies provided by a government to a company operating in a different country.\\nCircumventing U.S. Law - Section 301 of this legislation imposes statutory requirements for anti-circumvention inquiries to clarify the process and timeline. It also specifies the deadlines for preliminary and final determinations, which currently lack statutory deadlines.\\n\\nThe Level the Playing Field Act 2.0 enjoys strong support from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), the United Steelworkers, and steel manufacturers in Alabama.\\n“This legislation will strengthen the effectiveness of the U.S. trade laws and will give American workers the confidence that their government has every potential tool available to fight for a level playing field against foreign competitors that seek to cheat the system,” said Kevin Dempsey, President and CEO of AISI. “The domestic steel industry appreciates the leadership of Congresswoman Sewell in introducing this critical legislation, which is a companion piece to the bipartisan measure introduced earlier this year by Senators Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman. We urge both Republicans and Democrats to support this crucial bill.”\\nSens.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill 1.2 trillion dollars will create 2 million, good paying jobs every year in the United States of America. I want to thank all of you for your continued work.\\xa0\\nThe third thing he promised to deliver on is the Build back Better Act that just passed the House of Representatives.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass President Biden’s historic Build Back Better Act, once-in-a-generation legislation to lower costs for hard-working Alabamians, cut taxes for families and workers, and build an economy that puts working families first. Notably, it will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 per year. Among its many provisions, the bill would close the Medicaid coverage gap, create good-paying jobs, lower child care and health care costs, create universal pre-K, establish paid family and medical leave, reduce housing costs, and make the largest investment in combating the climate crisis in American history. The bill passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 220-213 and will now make its way to the U.S. Senate.\\n“Within six weeks of President Biden taking office, we passed the American Rescue Plan to save our economy, crush the pandemic, and deliver critical relief to Americans everywhere,” said Rep. Sewell. “Just last week, we delivered the largest investment in our nation’s infrastructure in nearly a century. Now, with the passage of President Biden’s historic Build Back Better Act, House Democrats are delivering on our promise to build an economy that puts working families first!”\\n“For far too long, those at the very top have seen their fortunes grow while hard-working Americans have been squeezed,” continued Sewell. “Not anymore—I’m proud to report that the Build Back Better Act will uplift Alabama’s most underserved communities with transformational progress! The bill will provide affordable health insurance to Alabamians caught in the coverage gap, lower prescription drug costs, create universal pre-K, extend the Child Tax Credit, address the climate crisis and environmental injustice with bold action, and so much more. Together, President Biden and Congressional Democrats will continue to deliver historic progress for the American people!”\\nThe Build Back Better Act:\\nCreates Millions of Good-Paying Jobs - Together with the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Build Back Better Act will create an average of 2 million jobs per year over the course of the next decade.\\nCuts Taxes for Families and Workers - Prior to the pandemic, 16% of children under the age of 18 in Alabama lived in poverty. The Build Back Better Act will bolster financial security and spur economic growth in Alabama by reducing taxes on the middle class and those striving to break into it. The bill will extend Child Tax Credit (CTC) increases of $300/month per child under 6 or $250/month per child ages 6 to 17. This will continue the largest one-year reduction in child poverty in history. Critically, the agreement includes permanent refundability for the Child Tax Credit, meaning that the neediest families will continue to receive the full Child Tax Credit over the long-run. The bill will also provide a tax cut of up to $1,500 for 274,300 low-wage workers in Alabama by extending the American Rescue Plan’s Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) expansion.\\nCloses the Medicaid Coverage Gap and Provides the Largest Expansion of Affordable Health Care in a Decade - Because states like Alabama refuse to expand Medicaid, about 4 million Americans and nearly 300,000 Alabamians lack health insurance. The Build Back Better Act will close the Medicaid coverage gap by extending through 2025 the enhanced premium subsidies in the ACA Marketplace that were included in the American Rescue Plan. In doing so, it will ensure that every Alabamian and every American in the Medicaid coverage gap has access to affordable health insurance.\\nExpands Medicare with Hearing Coverage for Seniors - Beginning January 1, 2023, the bill allows for qualified audiologists to deliver aural rehabilitation and treatment services under Medicare, in addition to the hearing and balance assessment services provided under current law. It also allows for qualified hearing aid professionals to deliver hearing assessment services under Medicare. The bill also provides for coverage of hearing aids under Medicare Part B forindividuals with moderately severe, severe or profound loss in one or both ears.\\nLowers Prescription Drug Costs - The Build Back Better Act allows the Secretary of HHS to negotiate certain drug prices and halts price hikes above inflation for all Americans. It ensures that Americans with diabetes don’t pay more than $35 per month for their insulin. It also creates a new, out-of-pocket cap of $2,000 on what seniors pay for their drugs in Medicare Part D.\\nLowers Child Care Costs - Working families across Alabama are facing a child care crisis. The high cost of child care is straining family budgets and pushing millions of Alabamians out of the workforce – a majority of whom are women. The lack of affordable child care is also hurting our economy. As workers are forced to stay home, employers are struggling to fill job openings to meet demand and grow their businesses. The Build Back Better Act will dramatically lower the cost of child care for many families. Under the bill, the vast majority of families would not pay more than seven percent of their income on child care, representing an enormous savings from what they pay now. The bill invests a total $390 billion for the child care initiative and the universal preschool initiative. Under the bill, child care providers would also have resources to raise wages for child care workers and expand available supply to serve more children and families.\\nEstablishes Paid Family and Medical Leave - The United States lags behind the rest of the industrialized world when it comes to guaranteeing paid family and medical leave. Only 21 percent of American workers have access to employer-provided paid family leave, and just 42 percent of American workers have access to paid medical leave through an employer-provided plan. The Build Back Better Act establishes a universal and permanent family and medical leave program. The program provides four weeks of paid parental, family caregiving, and medical leave.\\nProvides Universal, High-Quality, Free Pre-K for Every 3- and 4-year old in America - Today, only 23% of 3- and 4-year-olds in Alabama have access to publicly funded preschool, and it costs about $8,600 per year for those who can’t access a publicly-funded program. The Build Back Better Act will enable Alabama to expand access to free, high-quality preschool to more than about 105,000 additional 3- and 4-year-olds per year and increase the quality of preschool for children who are already enrolled. Parents will be able to send their children to the preschool setting of their choice—from public schools to child care providers to Head Start—leading to lifelong educational benefits, allowing more parents to go back to work, and building a stronger foundation for Alabama’s future economic competitiveness.\\nInvests in HBCUs, TCUs and MSIs - The Build Back Better Act invests $3 billion in a competitive grant program to improve the research capacity and research and development infrastructure at four-year Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). The competitive grant program will consist of planning grants for a period of one to two years and implementation grants for a period of one to five years. The bill also invests $6 billion in institutional aid grants to HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, which can be used by these institutions to strengthen their academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities and award need-based financial aid to low-income students.\\nReduces Housing Costs and Expands Housing Options - 260,000 renters in Alabama are rent burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent, while homeownership remains out of reach for many families. The Build Back Better Act will expand rental assistance for Alabama renters, while also increasing the supply of high-quality housing through the construction and rehabilitation of over 1 million affordable housing units nationwide. It will address the capital needs of the entire public housing stock in America and it includes one of the largest investments in down payment assistance in history, enabling more first-generation homebuyers to purchase their first home.\\nMakes the Largest Effort to Combat Climate Change in American History - From 2010 to 2020, Alabama experienced 38 extreme weather events, costing up to $20 billion in damages. The Build Back Better Act is the largest effort to combat climate change in American history, investing $555 billion over 10 years in clean energy and climate investments. It contains green tax credits which will save the average American family hundreds of dollars per year in energy costs. It also Ensures clean energy technology – from wind turbine blades to solar panels to electric cars – will be built in the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of good jobs here at home.\\nFor a comprehensive breakdown of the Build Back Better Act, click here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) will join President Biden for the signing of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act at the White House. The bill—which passed the House of Representatives on Friday, November 5th—is the largest investment in U.S. infrastructure in nearly a century. As the only member of the Alabama Congressional delegation to vote in favor of the bill, Rep. Sewell played a lead role in securing the inclusion of critical provisions that will benefit Alabama’s 7th District.\\n“Thanks to our hard work, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act contains transformational provisions that will directly benefit the people of Alabama’s 7th District,” said Rep. Sewell. “In addition to creating jobs and rebuilding our roads and bridges, the bill will help alleviate blocked railroad crossings and invest hundreds of millions of dollars in improving Alabama’s water infrastructure. Today, I will proudly stand with President Biden as he signs this bill and delivers these historic wins for the people!”\\nPresident Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act contains several provisions that will address blocked railroad crossings:\\n\\nThe Railroad Crossing Elimination Program - This section would authorize $500 million a year for the new Railroad Crossing Elimination grant program. This includes a small set-aside to carry out a highway-rail grade crossing safety information and education program.\\nBlocked Crossing Portal - This section would require the Federal Railroad Administration to establish a blocked crossing portal to collect information about blocked highway-rail grade crossings from the public. The Federal Railroad Administration is to use the information to assess the impact of blocked crossings, inform outreach to communities and railroads about blocked crossings, and produce an annual report on the program. This pilot program will expire three years after enactment.\\nNational Academies Study On Trains Longer Than 7,500 Feet -This section requires the Secretary to spend between $1 million and $2 million on a report by the National Academies on the operations, safety, and efficiency of trains longer than 7,500 feet, to be submitted to relevant Congressional committees within two years.\\nRailroad point of contact for public safety issues - This section would require all railroads to provide contact information on a public website so that the public could report public safety issues to the railroad.\\n\\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will make transformational investments in Alabama’s water infrastructure.\\xa0\\nCurrently, up to 10 million American households and 400,000 schools and child care centers lack safe drinking water. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, based on the traditional state revolving fund formula, Alabama will expect to receive $782 million over five years to improve water infrastructure across the state and ensure that clean, safe drinking water is a right in all communities. The bill also includes $23 billion nationally for the bipartisan Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act.\\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will also:\\nCreate Millions of Good-Paying Jobs - Together with the Build Back Better Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will create an average of 2 million jobs per year over the course of the next decade.\\nRepair and Rebuild Alabama’s Roads and Bridges - The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Alabama would expect to receive:\\n\\n$5.2 billion for federal-aid highway apportioned programs\\n$225 million for bridge replacement and repairs under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act over five years.\\xa0\\n\\nAlabama can also compete for the $12.5 billion Bridge Investment Program for economically significant bridges and nearly $16 billion of national funding in the bill dedicated for major projects that will deliver substantial economic benefits to communities.\\nConnect Every Alabamian to High-speed Internet - Broadband internet is necessary for Albamians to do their jobs, participate equally in school learning, health care, and to stay connected. Yet 18% of Alabama households do not have an internet subscription, and 11.5% of Alabama residents live in areas where, under the FCC’s benchmark, there is no broadband infrastructure. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Alabama will receive a minimum allocation of $100 million to help provide broadband coverage across the state, including providing access to the at least 565,000 Alabamians who currently lack it. It also makes 1,518,000 Alabamians (31%) eligible for the Affordability Connectivity Benefit, which will help low-income families afford internet access.\\nImprove Healthy, Sustainable Transportation Options - Alabamians who take public transportation spend an extra 66.2% of their time commuting and non-White households are 4.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation. 25% of transit vehicles in the state are past useful life. Based on formula funding alone, Alabama would expect to receive more than $400 million over five years under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to improve public transportation options across the state.\\nInvest in the Future of Electric Vehicle (EV) Travel in Alabama - The bill will build a network of EV chargers to facilitate long-distance travel and provide convenient charging options. The U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) sales is only one-third the size of the Chinese EV market. The bill invests $7.5 billion to build out the first-ever national network of EV chargers in the United States and is a critical element in the Biden-Harris Administration’s plan to accelerate the adoption of EVs to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Alabama would expect to receive $79 million over five years to support the expansion of an EV charging network in the state. Alabama will also have the opportunity to apply for the $2.5 billion in grant funding dedicated to EV charging in the bill.\\nImprove Alabama’s Airports - The United States built modern aviation, but our airports lag far behind our competitors. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, airports in Alabama would receive approximately $140 million for infrastructure development for airports over five years.\\nProtect Alabama’s Infrastructure from Climate Change and Cyber Attacks - The bill will prepare more of Alabama’s infrastructure for the impacts of climate change, cyber-attacks, and extreme weather events. From 2010 to 2020, Alabama has experienced 38 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $20 billion in damages. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, based on historical formula funding levels, Alabama will expect to receive:\\n\\n$23 million over five years to protect against wildfires; and\\xa0\\n$19 million to protect against cyberattacks.\\xa0\\n\\nAlabamans will also benefit from the bill’s historic $3.5 billion national investment in weatherization which will reduce energy costs for families.',\n",

This legislation will create millions of good-paying jobs, repair Alabama’s crumbling roads and bridges, expand access to high-speed affordable internet, and make transformational investments in Alabama’s drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. The bill's many provisions will supercharge America’s global competitiveness and put our nation back on track to have world class infrastructure. The bill passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 228-206 and will now make its way to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.\\n“Today we’ve made history!” said Rep. Sewell. “Thanks to President Biden and Congressional Democrats, the United States Congress has passed the largest investment in our nation’s infrastructure in nearly a century. With today’s vote, President Biden has accomplished what previous administrations have been trying to do for decades.”\\n“Alabama’s infrastructure has been falling behind for far too long,” continued Sewell. “The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act contains transformational provisions that will revitalize the 7th District by creating good paying jobs, fixing our crumbling roads and bridges, expanding access to broadband, and finally addressing our broken water infrastructure. I fought to ensure that equity is a central focus of this bill, and I’m proud that it will uplift hard-working Alabamians from our biggest cities to our most rural communities.”\\n“I want to thank Representative Sewell for her hard work passing the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “For too long we’ve neglected investments in critical areas that directly impact American workers, American businesses and American families. One of the many historic investments in this bill is the effort to bridge the digital divide and ensure all Americans have access to reliable, affordable broadband.

Last week, she joined Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee Chairman Larson (CT-01) to introduce Social Security 2100: A Sacred Trust, a landmark bill that would enhance Social Security benefits for the first time in 50 years.

       "  'date': 'October 25, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined House Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee Chairman John B. Larson (CT-01) to introduce Social Security 2100: A Sacred Trust. This landmark legislation would enhance Social Security benefits for the first time in 50 years, providing a benefit bump for beneficiaries, improving the cost of living formula, and providing credits for those who take time out of the workforce to care for a loved one. The bill is completely paid for by asking top earners to pay their fair share. Rep. Sewell joined Chairman Larson for a press conference today announcing the bill’s introduction which can be viewed here.\\n“As a proud member of the Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee, I know that Social Security is a critical lifeline for so many hard-working Americans in Alabama’s 7th district and across this nation,” said Rep. Sewell. “We should not only protect it, but improve it and expand it. With this bill, Social Security 2100, we’re ensuring that every worker can retire with dignity after a lifetime of work.”\\n“Social Security 2100: A Sacred Trust combines the best of the previous year’s Social Security 2100 Act with President Biden’s proposals to expand benefits and strengthen Social Security. The pandemic has only underscored what we already knew and has exacerbated systemic inequities -- current benefits are not enough! 5 million seniors are living in poverty due to longstanding discrimination in the labor force that affects mostly people of color and women. These are our mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, and neighbors. For too long, Congress has forsaken its duty to enhance benefits. It’s time that we act now,” said House Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee Chairman and lead sponsor John Larson.\\nSocial Security 2100 Increases Benefits:\\n\\nBenefit bump for current and new beneficiaries – Provides an increase for all beneficiaries that is the equivalent to about 2% of the average benefit. The US faces a retirement crisis and a modest boost in benefits strengthens the one leg of the retirement system that is universal and the most reliable.\\n\\n\\nProtection against inflation – Improves the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) formula to better reflect the costs incurred by seniors through adopting a CPI-E formula. This provision will help seniors who spend a greater portion of their income on health care and other necessities. Improved inflation protection will especially help older retirees and widows who are more likely to rely on Social Security benefits as they age.\\n\\n\\nProtects low-income workers – No one who paid into the system over a lifetime should retire into poverty. The new minimum benefit will be set at 25% above the poverty line and would be tied to wage levels to ensure that the minimum benefit does not fall behind.\\n\\nSocial Security 2100 Strengthens the Trust Fund\\n\\nHave millionaires and billionaires pay the same rate as everyone else – Presently, payroll taxes are not collected on wages over $142,800. This legislation would apply the payroll tax to wages above $400,000. This provision would only affect the top 0.4% of wage earners.\\n\\n\\nExtends the depletion date (when a 20% cut to benefits would occur) to 2038 – Giving Congress more time to ensure long term solvency of the Trust Funds.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nSocial Security Trust Fund Established – Social Security provides all-in-one retirement, survivor, and disability benefits funded through the dedicated FICA contribution paid by workers. There are technically two trust funds, Old-Age and Survivors (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI), that are usually referred to as the Social Security Trust Fund. This provision combines the OASI & DI trust funds into one Social Security Trust Fund, to ensure that all benefits will be paid.\\n\\nSocial Security 2100 also:\\n\\nImproves benefits for widows and widowers in two income households.\\nRepeals the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO) that currently penalize many public servants.\\nEnds the 5-month waiting period to receive disability benefits.\\nExtends dependent benefits for students through age 26 and includes part-time students.\\nIncreases access to benefits for children who live with grandparents or other relatives.',\n",

This historic $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package will level the playing field for working families, expand opportunity, and rebuild our economy to be more equitable and inclusive. Passage follows nearly 40 hours of debate by members of the House Ways and Means Committee during which Rep. Sewell secured the inclusion of several of her own bills.\\xa0\\n“President Biden and Congressional Democrats’ transformational Build Back Better agenda is about leveling the playing field for working families and growing our economy from the bottom up and middle out,” said Rep. Sewell. “With this bill, we are cutting taxes for middle class Americans and small businesses, expanding access to child care and healthcare, lowering prescription drug costs, and addressing the growing threat of climate change and environmental injustice.

       "  'text': \"Birmingham, AL –\\xa0Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin and Birmingham Housing Authority President David Northern, Sr. in welcoming Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge to Birmingham, Alabama. The visit was intended to promote the Biden-Harris Administration’s Build Back Better agenda which includes historic investments in housing construction and rehabilitation, economic development, and community revitalization.\\nThe visit began with a tour of the Villas at Titusville, a newly redeveloped affordable housing community in Birmingham, where Sec. Fudge and Rep. Sewell highlighted President Biden’s plan to build or preserve more than 2 million affordable and sustainable homes nationwide. Such a plan would drive down the costs of housing by dramatically expanding the country’s supply of affordable housing.\\nNext, Rep. Sewell joined Sec. Fudge for a tour of the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute to share a glimpse of Birmingham’s rich civil rights history. This was followed by a roundtable on affordable housing and community revitalization with state and local officials.\\nThe visit concluded with a tour of Southtown Court public housing community.\\nRep. Sewell’s remarks from this morning’s press conference are included below:\\nGood morning Birmingham! What a glorious day to welcome the Secretary of Housing and Development, my dear friend and former colleague Marcia Fudge, the 18th Secretary of HUD, to our wonderful city!\\nI am proud to host my friend and colleague in today’s tour and visit throughout Birmingham so that she can see how far we’ve come. As Secretary, she just toured the villas right here in Titusville and we are very proud of this new development.\\xa0\\nBut as Mayor Woodfin said and we all know, there’s still much work to be done right here in Birmingham and we could use more federal resources to do that work!\\nAs the only member of Alabama’s Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of the American\\xa0Rescue Plan, here’s what I know for a fact. I know that the people I represent need as much assistance as possible to thrive on the other end of this pandemic.\\nI’ve heard them. Mayor Woodfin has heard them, and the Biden Administration has heard them and that is why I am happy to stand here with Secretary Fudge and say that MORE HELP IS ON THE WAY!\\xa0\\nThat means more money.\\xa0\\nAs we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden, his cabinet, and Congressional Democrats have laid out a bold vision for our nation -- one that will help us not just return to the way things were, but instead to Build Back Better, stronger, and more EQUITABLY than before.\\nAs President Biden said himself, the best way to grow our economy is from the bottom up and the middle out, and that’s EXACTLY what we’re doing with the American Rescue Plan resources.\\xa0\\nThe City of Birmingham Alabama received 140 million dollars from the American Rescue Plan and I know that the Mayor and the City Council are hard at work making sure that those resources are there for the citizens of Birmingham to build back better.\\xa0\\nIt will make our lives much better and more affordable housing is one of the tenants of the American Rescue Plan.\\xa0\\nSo what does this mean for Alabama’s 7th Congressional District?\\xa0\\nHere in the 7th district, we’re tough. I’ve often said that what we lack in economic resources, we more than make up in a resilient spirit and hard work ethic and in making sure that we work together for our community.\\xa0 We know that we’ve had systemic DIS-INVESTMENT that has prevented too many of our people from reaching their full potential.\\nWe know that issues like pollution and lack of affordable, quality housing have really set us back. But we also know what’s possible. We see it right at this site. We will see it later at Southtown and the redevelopment that will go on with that as well.\\xa0\\nBut we have a historic opportunity with the American Rescue Plan and this Administration to Build Back Better than before and we must seize this opportunity.\\xa0\\nI’m so proud to join with Secretary Fudge, President Biden, and Congressional Democrats as we finally address these long-standing disparities that exist. The pandemic has only laid bare those disparities. Those disparities exist not only in housing, in healthcare, but in environmental injustice.\\xa0\\nAnd we know that with more resources we can not only build back better housing but build back more efficient and green housing and in doing so save our planet and be more efficient and provide very good, high-paying jobs for our community.\\xa0\\nThe Build Back Better agenda would build or preserve more than 2 million affordable and sustainable homes and would drive down the costs of housing by dramatically expanding our supply of affordable housing.\\nI also want to say that we’re not just doing the talk, we're doing the walk.\\xa0\\nIf you all turned on your televisions this morning you realize that Senate Democrats did pass a 3.5 trillion dollar blueprint that will usher in not only the American Rescue Plan but Biden’s American Jobs Plan and yes, American Family Plan as well. So we look forward to rolling up our sleeves and not just talking the talk but doing the walk.\\xa0\\nI’m also excited about the infrastructure package that passed through the Senate last night. It will include historic investments in Alabama.\\xa0\\nIt includes $5.2 billion in fixing Alabama’s highways. $225 million to repair and replace our failing bridges. And it would invest at least $100 million dollars for broadband.\\xa0\\nIf there’s anything that we’ve realized during this pandemic, it’s that the systemic disinvestment in infrastructure has been a huge disadvantage for communities of color and for low income families. No more. Help is on the way. Help is here. And more help is also on the way.\\xa0\\nI’m excited also that in the infrastructure package we were able to put the largest investment in clean drinking water and wastewater resources in America’s history.\\xa0\\nSo I’m excited to roll those out and look forward to coming back and telling my constituents not only did we do it but we did it well and that Alabama, Birmingham, will not only thrive through this pandemic but also come back and build back better.\\xa0\\nNow I get the honor of introducing my friend and former colleague.\\xa0\\nAs was said, Marcia Fudge brings a unique perspective to being the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. She was the first female and first African American Mayor of Warrensville Heights, Ohio!\\nShe understands very much not only the importance of local government and the needs of local government, but she understands and fights for and did fight for over a decade as the Congresswoman for the 11th District of Ohio.\\xa0\\nIt was an honor to serve with Marcia when she was the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. Throughout her career, Secretary Fudge has been a fierce advocate for low-income families, seniors, and communities across the country. During this challenging time in our nation’s history, there is no one better suited to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development than Secretary Fudge.\\xa0\\nAs we have seen today in the Titusville community, the work of this agency makes a tremendous difference in the lives of so many of our families.\\xa0\\nBut Secretary Fudge is not new to this work. Her foray into electoral politics began in 1999 when she was elected the first female and first African American Mayor of Warrensville Heights, Ohio. Among her many accomplishments as Mayor, Secretary Fudge adopted one of the first vacant and abandoned property ordinances in the state and helped to combat predatory lending. She also helped to address the city’s growing foreclosure crisis and prioritized improving the City’s tax base and expanded opportunities for affordable housing.\\nI am very excited, with no further ado, to introduce the 18th Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, none other than the distinguished Marcia Fudge!\\nBackground\\nToday’s events follow two significant milestones in the rollout of President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda and the fight to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure.\\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Senate passed President Biden’s $1 trillion infrastructure bill, a bipartisan agreement to make the largest long-term investment in our country’s infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century. This investment will grow the economy, create good jobs, enhance our competitiveness, and make our economy more sustainable, resilient, and equitable.\\xa0\\nAmong its many provisions:\\n\\nAlabama would expect to receive\\xa0$5.2 billion\\xa0for federal-aid highway apportioned programs and\\xa0$225 million\\xa0for bridge replacement and repairs over five years.\\nAlabama would receive a minimum allocation of\\xa0$100 million\\xa0to help provide broadband coverage across the state.\\nThe bill makes the\\xa0largest investment in clean drinking water and wastewater infrastructure\\xa0in American history, replacing all of the nation’s lead pipes and delivering clean water to millions of families.\\n\\nThis morning, the Senate also passed a budget resolution paving the way for congressional Democrats’ $3.5 trillion reconciliation package which is expected to include additional programs to drive down costs for hard-working families, expand access to health care, and invest in affordable housing and climate resiliency.\",\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that she secured the inclusion of over $7.8 million for eight community projects in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District in House Democrats’ FY2022 government funding bills. With the passage of these bills in the House of Representatives this week, funding for these community projects has cleared a key hurdle. The bills must now face negotiations in the Senate.\\n“I fought hard to secure funding for community projects in Alabama’s 7th District in the 2022 government funding bills, and I am beyond thrilled to announce that over $7.8 million was included for projects in our district,” said Rep. Sewell. “By including funding for these projects, House Democrats are bypassing bureaucracy and getting money directly into the community where it’s needed. I am hopeful that the Senate will swiftly approve this funding and I look forward to seeing President Biden sign it into law.”\\nIn April, Rep. Sewell submitted requests to the House Appropriations Committee to fund\\xa0community projects\\xa0in Alabama’s 7th District. Funding for eight of these projects, totaling\\xa0$7,829,355, was included in House Democrats’ appropriations package that passed in the House this week. The bills will now make their way to the Senate where they will face additional negotiations before being passed and signed into law by President Biden. Rep. Sewell looks forward to her other community project funding requests being included in Appropriations bills still pending before the House of Representatives.\\nRep. Sewell secured funding, totaling $7,829,355.00, for the following community projects in the House’s government funding bills:\\n*NOTE: Funding for these projects must still be passed by the Senate.\\n\\nJefferson County - Greater Shiloh Baptist Church - Employment and Training Project\\n\\nRecipient: Cornerstone Revitalization Foundation, Inc.\\nAward: $1,500,000.00\\nProject: To reduce recidivism, CWD will afford adults ages 25 and older opportunities to learn trade and technical skills. Participants will also have the opportunity to get their GED and pursue post-secondary education opportunities and help with obtaining affordable housing. The program is about assisting participants with not just jobs but careers.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nJefferson County - North Birmingham Community Development Rehabilitation Project\\n\\nRecipient: City of Birmingham\\nAward: $3,000,000.00\\nProject: The North Birmingham Community has suffered from environmental justice concerns for over a century. A largely redlined area, the community includes multiple coal refinement operations, the 35th Avenue Superfund site, and parts of the community sustain flood damage regularly. This project would remove environmental concerns in the old North Birmingham Elementary School.\\xa0The redevelopment of the North Birmingham site would provide a transformative redevelopment investment in North Birmingham.\\n\\n\\nJefferson County - Small Business Accelerator Program\\n\\nRecipient: Central Alabama Redevelopment Alliance\\nAward: $474,355.00\\nProject: The Small Business Accelerator provides micro companies and small businesses access to instructional workshops, key resource providers, and other support to help them expand and create jobs for the local community.\\xa0The Accelerator helps Alabama small businesses establish core systems and processes that would allow their business to survive a natural disaster, economic downturn, or other business interruptions.\\n\\n\\nLowndes County - Wastewater Disposal Treatment System Project\\n\\nRecipient: Lowndes County Unincorporated Wastewater Program\\nAward: $700,000.00\\nProject: Failing septic tanks and deteriorating wastewater infrastructure in Lowndes County have left many families with untreated sewage in their yards and in local waterways.\\xa0This is not only an infrastructure crisis, but a healthcare crisis. This funding would facilitate the installation of septic tanks for homes in unincorporated areas without proper wastewater disposal systems.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nPerry County – Drinking Water Infrastructure Project\\n\\nRecipient: City of Marion\\nAward: $480,000.00\\nProject: The improvement of the City of Marion’s water infrastructure is critical to the health and economic vitality of the community. Failures of the water system after recent natural disasters have threatened the continued operation of local institutions like Marion Military Institute and Judson College. These funds will help provide functional water systems to a community that is combating intergenerational poverty in the Black Belt.\\n\\n\\nSumter County - Hill Hospital Construction Project\\n\\nRecipient: Hill Hospital\\nAward: $575,000.00\\nProject: For several years, Hill Hospital has faced persistent challenges to provide comprehensive health care to the citizens in Sumter County. Geographic isolation, economic fluctuations, and the COVID 19 pandemic have magnified these challenges. This funding will improve the facilities and patient rooms at Hill Hospital so they can continue to serve the county and provide healthcare to the rural community. The long-term viability of Hill Hospital will prevent residents from traveling to other counties and states to seek health care.\\n\\n\\nTuscaloosa County - Community Health Worker Initiative\\n\\nRecipient: West Central Alabama Area Health Education Center\\nAward: $300,000.00\\nProject: The Community Health Worker Initiative will develop and implement a training program throughout Alabama to improve access to healthcare, increase community resilience, and promote health education in rural areas.\\xa0Nearly half of Alabama’s state population lives in a rural county, and on average, those individuals are more likely to be low-income, uninsured, and suffer from higher rates of chronic health conditions.\\xa0This program will help aid these communities while also addressing the primary care, dental, and mental health workforce shortage in Alabama.\\n\\n\\nTuscaloosa County -\\xa0TRAMS CORE Improvement of Postsecondary Education\\n\\nRecipient: Stillman College\\nAward: $800,000.00\\nProject: The Translational and Mechanistic Science for Collaborative Organic Research Environment (TRAMS CORE) program addresses traditional roadblocks for research and will provide a platform to generate new research efforts on the campus of a HBCU.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced over $7 million in federal funding for Head Start programs serving Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. This funding will allow Head Start programs to continue preparing Alabama children for success and will grow our economy by helping caregivers get back to work knowing their children are safe and cared for.\\n“Our children are our future and our greatest asset,” said Rep. Sewell. “Tragically, the COVID-19 pandemic deprived too many Alabama children of a safe, supportive learning environment, causing them to fall behind in their educational journeys.”\\n“The best way to put our country on a path to prosperity is by investing in the next generation of change-makers,” continued Sewell. “I’m so proud to announce that Head Start programs serving children in Alabama’s 7th District will receive over $7 million from the American Rescue Plan. This funding will help us bounce back from the devastation of the past year by getting parents back to work and providing our children the tools they need to grow and thrive.”\\nFunding, which totals $7,170,627 was awarded to the following Head Start programs serving Alabama’s 7th Congressional District.\\nHead Start programs serving only Alabama’s 7th District:\\n\\nPickens County Community Action Committee and Community Development Corporation, Inc. - $271,606\\nSumter County Opportunity, Inc. -\\xa0 $579,106\\nLowndes Co.

Sewell helped secure through the American Rescue Plan (previously announced) to keep Alabama’s child care providers on the job and keep costs down for working families.\\nThe American Rescue Plan also includes a historic increase in support for child care through the tax code, helping millions of working families afford needed care. Rep. Sewell played a critical role in drafting the expansions of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan, which are projected to cut child poverty in the United States in half. More information on the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit can be found here.\\nHow local Head Start programs are using funding from the American Rescue Plan\\n“The 2020 school year was very challenging,” said Cynthia Simpson, Executive Director of Pickens County Community Action. “We, like many other schools, elected to offer virtual learning to protect our staff and most importantly, our little people. We understand the burden this may have caused and the educational setback, so we are proud to offer the Pickens County Summer Learning Program for our students. The American Rescue Plans has provided the opportunity to offer summer learning to ensure our 4-year-olds are prepared for the transition to kindergarten. We were also able to purchase PPE and an additional bus to provide necessary space for support staff and students during transport to and from school.”\\n“The Blackbelt Community Foundation has been overwhelmed with requests for support from our communities,” said Felicia Lucky, President of the Blackbelt Community Foundation. “Funds made possible by the American Rescue Plan have allowed us to bridge the digital divide that was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We were able to purchase laptops to keep our children and staff safe as we all worked to decrease the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Most importantly, we have been able to extend necessary resources for the communities supported by the Blackbelt Community Foundation in Choctaw, Dallas, Marengo, and Wilcox counties. This ensures our children have the tools necessary to navigate educational requirements during these unprecedented times.”\\xa0\\n“The Lowndes County Head Start plans on using the funds from the American Rescue Plan to provide mental health support for children, families, and our staff as well as opportunities for professional development,” said Lashica Mason, Fiscal Manager for Lowndes County Head Start. “The funds will also help purchase cleaning supplies and new playground equipment.”\\nBackground on Head Start Programs\\nHead Start programs promote the school readiness of infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children from low-income families. Services are provided in a variety of settings including centers, family child care, and a child’s own home. Programs also engage parents or other key family members in positive relationships, with a focus on family wellbeing. Head Start programs provide services through 1,600 agencies in local communities and serve more than one million children per year in every state and U.S. territory. Most are run by non-profit organizations, schools, and community action agencies.',\n",

       "  'date': 'June 23, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell applauded the passage of H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (POWADA). This legislation would restore legal protections for older workers and empower them to hold employers accountable for age discrimination after the Supreme Court undermined protections for older workers in its 2009 decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc.\\xa0\\n“Older workers are a critical part of the workforce in Alabama’s 7th District, but because of the Supreme Court’s disastrous Gross decision in 2009, they remain particularly vulnerable to age\\xa0discrimination in the workplace,” said Rep. Sewell. “ I was so proud to cast my vote for this bill. It is long past time to restore protections for older workers and ensure that they are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.”\\xa0\\nA 2018 AARP survey found that 3 in 5 workers age 45 and older had seen or experienced age discrimination in the workplace. Moreover, the United States missed out on a potential $850 billion in GDP in 2018 because those age 50-plus who wished to remain in or re-enter the labor force, switch jobs, or be promoted within their existing company were not given that opportunity, according to study produced by AARP and Economist Intelligence Unit in 2020.\\nDespite the clear need for strong workplace protections for older workers, the Supreme Court’s 2009 decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. undermined protections against age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). Previous precedent only required that plaintiffs seeking to prove age discrimination in employment demonstrate that age was a motivating factor for the employer’s adverse action. However, this 5-4 Supreme Court decision now requires plaintiffs to prove “but-for” causation, or that age was the sole reason for the adverse employment action. This heightened evidentiary standard upended decades of precedent that had allowed individuals to prove discrimination by showing that a discriminatory motive was one of the factors on which an employer’s adverse action was based. Since the 2009 Gross decision, courts have applied the “but-for” standard to other civil rights laws.\\nThe Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act would:\\n\\nRestore longstanding protections under the ADEA which covers workers aged 40 and over. It would do so by replacing the Gross “but-for” test with the “mixed motive” test that Courts applied prior to 2009. This would align the burden of proof for age discrimination with the same standards currently in law for proving discrimination based on based on race and national origin.\\nAmend three other civil laws in addition to the ADEA – the anti-retaliation provisions in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 – to ensure that charges of discrimination under these three laws will also be adjudicated under the “mixed motive” standard. This would ensure victims are not required to refute every purported nondiscriminatory motive offered by the employer for their discriminatory action.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Darin LaHood (IL-18) introduced bipartisan legislation to boost post-graduation scholarships and strengthen workforce recruitment in rural America. The Workforce Development Through Post-Graduation Scholarships Act of 2021 would amend the Internal Revenue Service Code to exclude certain post-graduation scholarship grants from being treated as gross income which will alleviate student loan debt, help businesses attract and recruit talent, and boost economic growth in local communities.\\n“By attracting talented workers to jobs in Alabama’s rural and underserved communities, post-graduate scholarship grants play a critical role in boosting local economic growth and fostering prosperity, all while alleviating the burden of student debt,” said Rep. Sewell. “I’m proud to be introducing this legislation, which will ensure that these awards are effective tools for businesses and workers in Alabama’s 7th District.”\\n“In our modern economy, it’s essential we recruit talent into our workforce in underserved and rural communities and provide workers with the resources they need,\" said Rep. LaHood, lead Republican co-sponsor. \"Our legislation will alleviate the growing student debt, foster economic growth, and help organizations attract better talent and reward professionals who commit to their local communities.\"\\nA post-graduation scholarship is a type of charitable grant made by foundations to attract individuals with certain career skills to a given region. It functions much like a traditional scholarship but would pay off a portion of student loans held by an individual who has already completed a degree or technical program.\\nMuch like a traditional scholarship, the issuing foundation would establish appropriate eligibility requirements and put in place a process to verify that those requirements continue to be met through the duration of the scholarship award agreement. For example, a foundation that is looking to attract nurses or doctors to a community facing a shortage of qualified health professionals could award a post-graduation scholarship to a recipient but require that an individual live and be employed within a range of ZIP codes for a set number of years.\\xa0\\nThe Workforce Development Through Post-Graduation Scholarships Act of 2021 would amend the Internal Revenue Service Code to exclude certain post-graduation scholarship grants from being treated as gross income which would increase the effectiveness of these awards by reducing the burden of student debt and boosting economic growth.\\nThe bill already enjoys broad support from across the philanthropic sector.\\n“The student debt crisis is damaging the financial futures of American students and families,\" said Kathleen Enright, President & CEO of the Council on Foundations. \"For rural communities where it can be more difficult to attract or retain people with the skills to fill needed jobs, post-graduation scholarships are a great incentive for recent graduates to come back home or move to places they may not have previously considered. The Workforce Development Through Post-Graduation Scholarships Act provides foundations with tools to help attract talent to meet the needs in their communities. This legislation is a result of years of collaboration between members of Congress and philanthropic leaders, and I urge Congress to send this bill to the President’s desk to sign into law immediately.”\\nCompanion legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sens.

The bill would allow for part-time employees to begin saving for retirement sooner by reducing the number of years of service required to make retirement contributions.

Terri Sewell (AL-07) welcomed First Lady of the United States Dr. Jill Biden to Birmingham to highlight the historic reduction in child poverty that will be achieved thanks to the American Rescue Plan. Rep. Sewell played a critical role in drafting the expansions of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan, which are projected to cut child poverty in the United States by more than a half.\\xa0\\nRep. Terri Sewell: Good afternoon Birmingham! What a great day to welcome Dr. Jill Biden, the First Lady of the United States, to our wonderful city of Birmingham.\\xa0\\nAs the only member of the Alabama Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of the 1.9 trillion dollar American Rescue Plan, here’s what I know for a fact: the people that I represent need assistance to get through COVID-19. I heard from them, and I know that they need money to be able to afford food on their tables and resources to make sure that they are equitably receiving the vaccine.\\xa0\\nThank God that because of the American Rescue Plan, 1.9 trillion dollars were able to put shots in arms and in record time. You know the Biden-Harris Administration said that they were going to do 100 million shots in arms by the first 100 days. We were able to do it in 58 days! We also know that we needed direct funds to our state but also to our counties and our cities. I heard you Mr. Mayor and all of our mayors across the 7th Congressional District when they said they wanted direct resources and I am proud to announce that help is here!\\nToday I am thrilled to talk about another aspect of the American Rescue Plan. We knew that it was critically important that we help families, the whole family. We knew how important it was to help our children so the second round of $600 that went out in December, as well as the $1400 that went out just 2 weeks ago, include resources not just for the adults in the family, but for the children in the family as well. Through this plan, a family of 4 would receive not just the $1,400 for mom and dad, but for their children as well. That’s $5600 for an average family of four.\\xa0\\nToday I am proud to be right here at the YWCA and I want to thank LaRhonda and all of your staff for hosting us today. We started off at the James Rushton Early Learning Center at Woodlawn and I want to thank them and the Woodlawn Foundation for allowing us to see firsthand how our children are not only learning but they are thriving even in the midst of this pandemic. And that’s what it’s about.\\xa0\\nUnder the leadership of LaRohanda and so many others, the YWCA of Central Alabama has had a profound impact on countless families and children in our region. As I said earlier today, we were at the Woodlawn Foundation’s James Rushton Early Learning Center, where we toured a classroom and met with children who are benefiting every day from this institution. For years they have dedicated themselves to revitalizing the community of Woodlawn and they are doing it. They’re not just talking about it—they are about it!\\nAlso, I am thrilled to be with Alabama Child Advocate Liz Huntley who will introduce Dr. Biden in a minute. She is among the countless local leaders that are present here today as we talk about child poverty and the fact that the American Rescue Plan deals will deal with that directly.\\xa0\\nI see my dear friend, Senator Doug Jones: You will always be my Senator! And his lovely wife, Louise, thank you.\\xa0\\nThe Biden Administration knows that the time is now to address the systemic inequities that have left so many families struggling to make it. Together with Congressional Democrats, we passed the American Rescue Plan because of our fundamental belief that good governance creates an environment that allows all of our people to reach their full potential. If we’ve learned anything during this pandemic, it’s that we cannot wait a single day to provide resources to America’s working and struggling families to try and level the playing field, especially for our children. That is why I\\'m so proud to have been the only Democrat in Alabama’s Delegation to vote in favor of the 1.9 trillion dollar American Rescue Plan.\\xa0\\nWe know that one of the greatest contributors to the opportunity gap between children in communities like the one we’re in right now and the ones in wealthy neighborhoods across the nation is the financial investment the parents are able to make in their children. Every parent I met in my district, irrespective of zip code, wanted the best for their children, but they struggle day in and day out just to make ends meet. They fall behind when it matters most and we know that we need additional resources for our public schools.\\nI am proud that we are investing in our public schools not just immediately but also acknowledging that we need remedial help as well. Our children learn best in the classroom and we all know that which is why the American Rescue Plan will be giving direct assistance to individual school systems such as Jefferson County Public Schools and the City of Birmingham Public Schools. That is hundreds of millions of dollars and that money will be earmarked to not only deal with COVID-19 relief now to get our children back into schools safely, but also to deal with the remedial learning that we know our children will need. And so I want you all to know that the American Rescue Plan is truly that: a rescue plan to deal with COVID-19 and make sure our communities not only survive this pandemic, but they thrive through it!\\nAs of 2019, 34% of the children in my district lived below the poverty line and 53% of those children, that\\'s over half of the children in America, do not receive the full benefits of the Child Tax Credit because it isn’t fully refundable. We know that our response has to be big and bold in this rescue plan.\\xa0\\nIt is important that we use every tool in the toolbox to deal with this pandemic and to provide relief. As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, our jurisdiction is taxes. It is the revenue-generating operation of the House, and we thought that it was critically important that we make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable.\\xa0\\nWhat do I mean by that? By making this Child Tax Credit fully refundable, we are reaching the neediest of families. We are not only doing that, we are also expanding it by providing direct payments in the form of a child allowance. This year families will receive $3,600 per child under the age of 6 and $3,000 per child for children between the ages of 6 and 16. These payments will be made on a recurring monthly basis with families receiving their first checks hopefully in July.\\xa0\\nThis is about saving working families and ensuring our children get out of poverty. As a lifelong educator, I know that Dr. Jill Biden has dedicated herself to transforming the lives of American children. Now, as the First Lady, she has taken the same vigor and applied it to eradicating child poverty. We know that just by making the Child Tax Credit fully refundable that we can lift 40% of the children living below the poverty line above it. The American Rescue Plan not only provides help, but it also uplifts our community and it does so for our children as well.\\xa0\\nI want to say in closing that it was Martin Luther King that said, “poverty is a state of mind but, it also is a state of existence\" and we in the greatest country in the world, should not have anyone living in poverty. We need to figure out a way that we can provide the resources so that every child can grow up and reach their fullest potential. We see that with the wonderful children here at the YWCA and we saw that at the James Rushton Early Learning Center.\\xa0\\nI am so happy that Dr. Jill Biden chose to come to Alabama, to Birmingham, to tell us that the help that we’ve been looking for is here. It is going to be incumbent on all of us in this room to use those resources to the best of our ability to make sure that everyone gets through this pandemic.\\xa0\\nBackground on the American Rescue Plan District Tour:\\xa0\\nRep. Sewell’s American Rescue Plan District Tour is a series of site visits, roundtable discussions, and constituency meetings to connect residents of Alabama’s 7th Congressional District with all the resources available in the American Rescue Plan.

       "  'title': 'Rep. Sewell Introduces Legislation to Tackle Doctor Shortages During COVID-19 Pandemic',\n",
       "  'date': 'March 29, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (D-AL), John Katko (NY-24), Tom Suozzi (NY-03), and Rodney Davis (IL-13) introduced legislation that would take critical steps towards reducing nationwide physician shortages by boosting the number of Medicare-supported residency positions. The Resident Physician Shortage Act of 2021 would support an additional 2,000 positions each year from 2023 to 2029, for a total of 14,000 residency positions.\\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the urgent need for qualified doctors in Alabama and across our Nation. That is why I am re-introducing the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act to increase the number of Medicare-supported residency positions to meet our growing demand for quality health care,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “I am proud this bipartisan legislation also provides hospitals and health centers the tools they need to increase access to care, lower wait times for patients, and create a pipeline of qualified medical professionals to serve Americans’ health needs.”\\n“I’m proud to reintroduce this bipartisan measure to help hospitals in Central New York and nationwide recruit and retain medical residents,” said Rep. Katko. “Our nation faces a dire physician shortage, and we need to do more to allow teaching hospitals and academic medical centers to train more healthcare professionals.\\xa0 This measure adds more residency spots to Medicare’s Graduate Medical Education (GME) program to train emerging physicians and ensure communities nationwide have better access to care.”\\n\"If COVID has shown us anything, it\\'s that we need more highly trained doctors,\" said Rep. Suozzi. \"Ensuring there are more opportunities for aspiring doctors to go through residency programs will help our nation provide better care, lower wait times, and increase access to health care.\"\\n“Like many critical professions, our nation is facing a shortage of physicians. As our population grows and ages, it’s vital that we do everything we can at the federal level to remove barriers to encourage more individuals to enter the medical profession,” said Rep. Davis. “That’s why I’m proud to team up my colleagues in the House to introduce the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act. Our bipartisan legislation provides teaching hospitals with the tools they need to increase the number of students they can host for their residency training, helping to alleviate the physician shortage.”\\nTo become a practicing doctor in the U.S., medical school graduates must complete a residency program. However, for the past two decades, an artificial cap on the number of residents funded by Medicare – which is the primary source of payment for residents – has limited the expansion of training programs and the number of trainees.\\xa0\\nAccording to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the United States will face a physician shortage of between 42,600 and 121,300 physicians by 2030. As the American population grows older, the demand for physicians and other medical professionals will increase. This demand has been made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the vital role that physicians and other health care providers play in our nation’s health care infrastructure. The Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act would help expand the physician workforce to address the estimated shortage of physicians and serve as an essential component of our efforts to address current and future public health crises, as well as to bolster our nation’s health care infrastructure and help ensure access to high-quality health care for all. The AAMC is committed to working with Representatives Sewell, Katko, Suozzi, and Davis, along with their House colleagues, to enact this critical piece of legislation that will help alleviate the doctor shortage and improve the health of people everywhere,” said David J. Skorton, MD, President and CEO of Association of American Medical Colleges.\\xa0\\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the nation’s worsening physician shortage and the critical importance of teaching hospitals and their mission to train medical residents,” said Greater New York Hospital Association President Kenneth E. Raske. \\xa0“This important bill tackles the problem head-on by adding 14,000 Medicare-funded graduate medical education slots. The teaching hospital community thanks Representatives Sewell, Katko, Suozzi and Davis for their leadership on this vital issue.”\\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of having an adequate physician workforce.\\xa0 The long-standing cap on Medicare-supported graduate medical education positions restricts access to care by narrowing the pipeline of future physicians practicing in the United States,” said Dr. Susan R. Bailey, President of the American Medical Association.\\xa0 “The AMA is proud to support the bipartisan Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act as the allocation of 14,000 new residency slots will improve access to care regardless of where patients live.”\\nThe Resident Physician Shortage Act of 2021 is available here.',\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) spoke at a press conference with RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum and Representatives Andy Levin (MI-09), Jamaal Bowman (NY-16), Cori Bush (MO-01), and Nikema Williams (GA-05) in support of Amazon employees' right to unionize in Bessemer. Below are Sewell’s remarks.\\xa0\\nRep. Terri Sewell: I’m Congresswoman Terri Sewell, and I am honored each and every day to represent Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. I want to thank Stuart, I want to thank the workers from Amazon, and all of the organizers from RWDSU for the courage to stand with Alabama workers.\\xa0\\nThe world is watching Alabama, and I want you to know that these workers are following a rich tradition—a tradition of civil rights and human rights of crusading against something that is wrong. This weekend, we celebrate the 56th Anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. I know that Alabama workers, like Kevin, Jennifer, and Darryl, all of these Amazon workers, stand in the same tradition as John Lewis, as Amelia Boynton Robinson, as those Foot Soldiers that dared to change the world by having the audacity to stand up for their rights.\\xa0\\nI am welcomed today by a delegation from Congress who are standing with these workers, and we have one message. Our message is: We see you! We hear you, Alabama workers! And we are with you! We are with you!\\nI just want all of you to know that it is a basic human right, the right to organize, and it is in my DNA. I am the daughter of educators, and if it wasn’t for the Alabama Education Association, AEA, my mother and my father would not have been able to integrate public schools in Alabama in order to be teachers, in order to be coaches, in order to be guidance counselors.\\nIt is important that the people of Alabama know that workers have rights. It is because of unions that we have a five day work week. It is because of unions that we have safer conditions in our places of work. It is because of unions that we have benefits.\\xa0\\nAnd so, all we ask is that, free of intimidation, the people of Alabama, Amazon workers, have the right to choose whether or not they organize—free of intimidation, free of interference. That is what we want.\\xa0\\nI want to thank my colleagues for joining me, and today I’m with four of them: Congressman Andy Levin from Michigan; Congressman Jamaal Bowman from New York; Congresswoman Nikema Williams from Georgia; and Congresswoman Cori Bush from Missouri.\\xa0\\nWe proudly stand with Alabama workers in Bessemer, Alabama because we know, we know, that standing up for the right of people to organize and collectively bargain is a God-given right for anyone who is working in America. And we look forward to going back to Congress and passing the PRO Act, which would streamline the NLRB, and stop companies from intimidating their workers.\\xa0\\nIt’s critically important that you all know that we all stand on the shoulders of John Lewis, who said if you see something that ain’t right, that’s not just, we have a moral obligation to do something about it.\\nSo, we stand in solidarity with the workers. It’s critically important that you all know that we don’t stand alone. The world is watching Alabama once again. And, once again, my district, Birmingham and Bessemer, it is so important that the world knows that once again, Alabama is standing up for civil rights, and for human rights.\\nVideo of Rep.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. - Today, Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted in favor of the Updated Heroes Act, House Democrats’ latest legislation to address the ongoing needs that have resulted from the COVID-19 public health crisis. This bill reflects current negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, as well as needs that have risen since the original Heroes Act passed the House of Representatives in May 2020.\\n“It is unfortunate that the White House and Senate Republicans have not been willing to compromise to provide additional money for ongoing relief to our communities, workers, and families,” Sewell said. “With passage of the Updated Heroes Act today, House Democrats’ have given the White House and Senate Republicans one more chance to pass another stimulus bill that will continue to provide critical relief for the American people.”\\xa0\\n“The provisions in the Updated Heroes Act are essential to avert greater economic and health catastrophe for families, schools, small businesses, essential workers, and health care providers in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District,” Sewell continued. “Not only does this legislation deliver much-needed resources to Alabama counties and cities, it also reflects House Democrats’ willingness to compromise in good faith to ensure our country can weather this ongoing crisis.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Updated Heroes Act would provide counties and cities in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District with $396 million in funding to cover coronavirus-related outlays and revenue loss and pay our health care workers, library staff, law enforcement, fire, transportation, EMS, teachers and other vital workers who keep us safe and are in danger of losing their jobs. A town-by-town breakdown of the estimated funding allocations for the 7th District under the Updated Heroes Act is available here.\\nIn addition to resources for our state, local, tribal and territorial governments, the Updated Heroes Act maintains key priorities from the original version of the legislation that passed the House in May. The bill also provides families with a second round of direct payments of $1,200 for each individual and $500 for each dependent, and extends weekly $600 federal unemployment payments through January 2021.\\xa0\\nAmong the bill’s many provisions, it:\\n\\n\\nProvides strong support for small businesses by improving the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to serve the smallest businesses and struggling non-profits, providing hard-hit businesses with second loans, and delivering targeted assistance for the struggling restaurant industry and independent live venue operators.\\n\\n\\nMore funds to bolster education and child care, with $225 billion for education – including $182 billion for K12 schools and nearly $39 billion for postsecondary education – and $57 billion to support child care for families.\\n\\n\\nSupports testing, tracing and treatment, through $75 billion for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and isolation measures, with special attention to the disparities facing communities of color, ensuring every American can access free coronavirus treatment, and supporting hospitals and providers. The updated bill also includes $28 billion for procurement, distribution and education campaigns for a safe and effective vaccine.\\n\\n\\nProtects payrolls, by enhancing the new employee retention tax credit that encourages employers to keep employees on payroll.\\n\\n\\nPreserves health coverage, protecting Americans losing their employer-provided health insurance by making unemployed Americans automatically receive the maximum ACA subsidy on the exchanges, as well as a special enrollment period in the ACA exchanges for uninsured Americans.\\n\\n\\nStrengthens food security, addressing rising hunger with a 15 percent increase to the maximum SNAP benefit and additional funding for nutrition programs that help families put food on the table as well as targeted support for farmers and producers impacted by the crisis.\\n\\n\\nSafeguards our democracy, with new resources to ensure safe elections, an accurate Census, and preserve the Postal Service.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n###',\n",

       "  'date': 'September 21, 2020',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) applauded the passage of H.R. 991, a bipartisan bill, she introduced to reauthorize the U.S. Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) until September 2030. The legislation passed the House by unanimous voice vote.\\n\\xa0\\nThe CBTPA is a preferential trade agreement that provides for duty and quota-free access for apparel products manufactured in designated beneficiary Caribbean Basin region countries. CBTPA also requires that Caribbean Basin countries use U.S. formed yarns, fabrics, and thread. The CBTPA was first enacted in 2000 and is currently authorized through September 30, 2020. Eligible CBTPA countries include Barbados, Belize, Curacao, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago.\\n\\xa0\\n“As the lead sponsor of the legislation to reauthorize the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, I am thrilled that Congress is taking action on this issue before the program expires at the end of the month,\" said Rep. Sewell. \"CBTPA is such an important economic tool for the United States and each of our partner countries, and it is critical to our continued diplomatic relationships in the Caribbean Basin. The bipartisan effort to reauthorize this program will allow us to export more American-made goods and strengthen Western supply chains, while contributing to economic development and job creation in Haiti and other countries throughout the Caribbean Basin region. I am grateful for its passage by unanimous voice vote in the House, and I urge the Senate to take up this bill before the September 30th deadline. ”\\n\\xa0\\n\"I am incredibly grateful for Congresswoman Sewell\\'s commitment to economic prosperity in the Republic of Haiti and the Caribbean region. The Extension of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA), H.R. 991, which has received bipartisan and bicameral support, is a testament to Congress\\' unwavering support for working families in Haiti and CARICOM countries. This legislation has created countless jobs and generated billions of dollars in revenue over the past decade,” said Ambassador Herve Denis.\\n\\xa0\\n\"Furthermore, CBTPA would play a crucial role in strengthening the supply chains for PPEs and textiles in response to COVID-19, making America less dependent on nations outside the Western Hemisphere. With the issues regarding China, Haiti hopes and expects to benefit from the \"Near-Shoring\" concept introduced by Congress. Together, we can continue to strengthen bilateral trade relations between two of the oldest republics in the Americas.\"\\n\\xa0\\n“I’m proud to support our nation’s trade preference programs, which bolster further economic expansion in developing nations and support jobs here in America – a true win-win scenario,” said Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), Republican lead co-sponsor. “In particular, our bipartisan bill to extend the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act accomplishes that goal in the Caribbean, providing trade benefits to eight Caribbean nations, most notably Haiti. I want to thank Congresswoman Terri Sewell for partnering with me on this important legislation and urge the Senate to consider it without delay.”\\n\\xa0\\nTogether, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) and the CBTPA are collectively known as the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). These two acts work together to facilitate the development of 17 independent countries of the Caribbean Basin region. For these two preferential trade programs to be effective, both CBTPA and CBERA must be authorized. Eligible CBERA countries include Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the British Virgin Islands, Curacao, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n###',\n",

       "  'date': 'December 10, 2018',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Terri Sewell (D-AL) and Congresswoman Suzan DelBene (D-WA) introduced the Lifelong Learning and Training Account Act. This bill would create a tax-preferred savings account with a generous government match to assist low and moderate-income workers seeking to retrain or upskill over the course of their careers. This legislation was introduced in the Senate by Senator Mark Warner (D-VA).\\nStudies show that in the years ahead, more workers will be forced to learn new skills throughout their careers. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2020, more than one-third of the core skill sets of most jobs will be skills that are not considered crucial to today’s workforce. The Lifelong Learning and Training Account Act would give workers a portable, government-matched savings vehicle for lifelong learning so they can continue to work and provide for their families.\\n“If we want to grow our economy and create better jobs for American families, we have to invest in our nation’s number one asset – our workforce,” said Rep. Sewell. “That means providing our workers with opportunities to learn new skills and transition into competitive jobs in a changing economy. The Lifelong Learning and Training Account Act gives working families the tools they need to save for retraining and continuing education over the course of their careers. For workers in Alabama’s 7th District and across the country, today’s bill represents a step forward in our fight for better jobs, better pay, and a better future for our families.”\\n“As our economy continues to change, workers must have access to the opportunities of tomorrow,” said Rep. DelBene. “Right now, many hardworking Americans don’t have the skillsets to transition into a new job. This legislation will give those folks the tools to retrain and learn new skills so they can keep up with advances in technology and earn a good-paying job. Investing in these workers and helping them further their educations will yield benefits that help middle-class families thrive.”\\n“By 2030, up to one-third of American workers will need to retrain or change jobs to keep up with disruptions due to automation and a changing economy. That means lifelong learning will be the new normal for millions of Americans,” said Sen. Warner. “The Lifelong Learning and Training Account Act represents the first major investment towards helping workers pay for the education and training necessary to modernize their skills, and I’m pleased that this important legislation is moving forward in the House of Representatives.”\\nThe Lifelong Learning and Training Account Act creates employee-owned Lifelong Learning and Training Account (LLTA) savings plans. Contributions to an LLTA by low-to-moderate income workers or their employers are eligible for a dollar-for-dollar federal match of up to $1,000. The federal matching funds are directly deposited into the LLTA immediately after the contribution by the worker or employer. The worker then gets to choose how to use the LLTA funds, which can be applied towards any training that leads to a recognized post-secondary credential.\\nThe full text of the bill can be read here.\\n###\\nRep.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Tuesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers from the House Ways & Means Committee met with President Donald Trump to discuss tax reform priorities. Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) sits on the Ways & Means Committee and joined the meeting, which also included Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) and Ranking Member Richard Neal (D-MA).\\n“My constituents deserve tax reform that gives working families and small businesses the relief they need, not another tax cut for the wealthy. Working families in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District have been waiting too long for tax cuts for the wealthy to ‘trickle-down’ to them,” said Rep. Sewell. “As Congress considers tax reform legislation, I will work to advance policies that incentivize workforce development and enhance the earned income tax credit so that it better serves middle and working class Americans.”\\n“I have always said, if you’re not at the table then you’re on the menu. Today’s meeting was a chance to talk with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle about some of the bipartisan tax reform proposals I have introduced and the needs of my constituents. I strongly disagree with a number of the points in President Trump’s proposed tax outline. But I will not miss an opportunity to be a strong voice for tax reform that puts my constituents and other working-class Americans first.”\\nRep. Sewell has introduced the bipartisan Workforce Development Tax Credit Act (H.R. 1781) with Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-AL). This legislation prepares the workforce for manufacturing jobs by providing federal tax credits for businesses that offer apprenticeship programs and additional tax credits for companies that hire apprentices.\\n###\\nRep.

The letter, led by Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07), Cheri Bustos (IL- 17), Ann McLane Kuster (NH-02), and Donald Norcorss (NJ-01), outlines the importance of apprenticeship and urges the administration to maintain strong levels of funding for apprenticeship initiatives across the country.\\n“When it comes to jobs and workforce development, it’s time for this Administration to walk the walk,” said New Dem Vice-Chair Rep. Terri Sewell. “Rather than slashing the budget for worker training programs, we need to provide more opportunities for American workers to gain the skills and training needed to compete in the modern economy. The workforce development programs which the President cuts in this year’s budget have helped to reduce unemployment in Alabama and have brought veterans back into the civilian workforce. Hardworking Americans deserve more than empty rhetoric on jobs, and I urge this President to make good on his promise for job growth by working with Congress to support and strengthen our proven workforce development programs.”\\nIn conjunction with the letter, the New Democrat Coalition is hosting the third of its forums on the Future of Work this week. The forum will focus on workforce development, 21st century skills training, and the opportunities apprenticeship initiatives can offer.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Terri Sewell (AL-7) and Congressman Bradley Byrne (AL-1) reintroduced the Workforce Development Tax Credit Act (H.R. 1781), a bipartisan bill that prepares our workforce for manufacturing jobs by providing federal tax credits for businesses that offer apprenticeship programs and additional tax credits for companies that hire apprentices.\\nThe Manufacturing Institute says nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs will need to be filled over the next decade; however, approximately 2 million of those jobs will go unfilled due to a skilled labor shortage.\\n“A strong manufacturing sector is crucial for our nation’s economic growth and prosperity. The Workforce Development Tax Credit Act encourages businesses to work with community colleges and universities to develop apprenticeship programs that will lead to more skilled workers. Emphasizing skills training will enable our country to maintain its competitive edge, and help bring more Americans into the middle class. I am proud to sponsor this bill with Bradley Byrne, my friend and fellow Alabamian, and I look forward to its passage,” said Rep. Sewell.\\n“The workforce needs in the United States are rapidly changing, and skills training is becoming more important than ever before. That’s why I am proud to join my friend and colleague Terri Sewell in introducing the Workforce Development Tax Credit Act. By encouraging businesses to partner with community colleges and universities to advance workforce training initiatives, we can help connect Americans with the skills they need to get a job and meet growing industry demands,” Rep. Byrne.\\n\"The Workforce Development Tax Credit Act is in total alignment with the goals of the Alabama Workforce Investment Board and with the recommendations made by the Alabama Workforce Council regarding public/private partnerships,\" said George Clark, President of Manufacture Alabama, Chairman of the Alabama Workforce Investment Board, and Vice-Chairman of the Alabama Workforce Council.\\nReps. Chris Van Hollen (MD-8), Joseph Crowley (NY-14), Tim Ryan (OH-17), Raul Ruiz (CA-36) and John Carney (DE-At Large) are original co-sponsors of the bill.\\n“Apprenticeship programs are a critical tool to bridge the skills gap and help employers train and hire workers for jobs that strengthen our economy,” said Rep. Van Hollen, Ranking Member of the House Budget Committee. “I am proud to stand with Representatives Sewell and Byrne and support this common-sense approach to incentivize apprenticeships and help connect workers to good-paying jobs in my home state of Maryland and across the country.”\\n“Apprenticeships are an effective method for giving Americans the specified, hands-on experience they need in order to obtain a secure, good-paying job,” said Rep. Joe Crowley, Vice Chair of the Democratic Caucus. “We should do everything we can to incentivize the creation of these programs, which have a demonstrated record of success. I’m proud to join Reps. Sewell and Byrne in introducing this critical legislation.”\\n\\xa0“Manufacturing is the backbone of the American economy, but in order for this industry to continue to grow and thrive we must have a skilled workforce. That is why I am happy to join my colleagues in introducing the bipartisan Workforce Development Tax Credit Act. This legislation will ensure that we have apprenticeship programs to prepare our young people for today’s job market. This tax credit will help us remain a world leader and on the cutting edge in manufacturing,” said Rep. Ryan.\\n“Since I first came to Congress, reinvigorating the manufacturing sector has been among my top priorities. The revitalization of the manufacturing sector is essential to creating stronger economic growth and securing the financial future of working families. I am proud to join colleagues on both sides of the aisle in co-sponsoring the Workforce Development Tax Credit Act, which creates fruitful new partnerships between the business community and institutions of higher learning to provide new training and apprenticeship opportunities, and to help address the industry’s need for more skilled labor,” said Rep. Carney.\\nHighlights of the Bill\\nThe Workforce Development Tax Credit Act of 2015 would close the skill gap and encourage job creation by providing federal tax credits to employers that create apprenticeship programs. An additional tax credit is offered to businesses that subsequently hire and retain apprentices for at least one year post-apprenticeship.\\nThe goals of this bill are to train workers for skilled manufacturing jobs, assist companies in creating recruitment pipelines and decreasing costly turnover, and provide incentives for businesses to manufacture in America.\\n###',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. -- Congresswoman Terri Sewell issued the following statement ahead of President Obama’s trip to the City of Birmingham, Alabama, where she will join him as he discusses efforts his Administration has made to create a safer financial system that protects American families and creates a strong economy. The President is expected to discuss the economy, payday lending and the success of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):\\n“President Obama is a staunch advocate for a strong financial system that provides greater transparency and accountability for all Americans. Under his administration the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has helped consumers recover more than $5.3 billion by ending unfair and abusive practices.\\xa0\\n“I hosted CFPB Director Richard Cordray in Birmingham for their first Field Hearing on Payday Lending. While I understand there is a real need for emergency credit, I strongly believe consumer protections are needed to regulate this industry.\\n“The President’s visit to the City brings the national spotlight to the State of Alabama, a state with one of the highest concentrations of payday lenders. Thus, it is fitting that President Obama will travel to Birmingham to speak about the progress we have made to build a safer and stronger financial system that protects families from the abuses which led the economy to near collapse—and his commitment to safeguarding that progress.\\xa0\\n“America has a lot of work to do to improve our economy.\\xa0 The City of Birmingham and the State of Alabama have the tools and the leadership needed to create solid job growth and make the economic recovery a reality for those struggling families who have yet to feel its full effects.\\n“As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, I will continue to work with my colleagues to promote better financial practices that protect consumers, strengthen our economy and stimulate economic growth.\\n“I welcome President Obama to Birmingham for his second visit to Alabama this month. His selection of Lawson State Community College, in the heart of my district, acknowledges the vital role two-year colleges play in preparing our youth for 21st century jobs and giving them the necessary tools to make better financial decisions for themselves and their families.”\\xa0\\n###',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C.\\xa0– Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that she secured the inclusion of over $7.8 million for eight community projects in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District in House Democrats’ FY2022 government funding bills. With the passage of these bills in the House of Representatives this week, funding for these community projects has cleared a key hurdle. The bills must now face negotiations in the Senate.\\n“I fought hard to secure funding for community projects in Alabama’s 7th District in the 2022 government funding bills, and I am beyond thrilled to announce that over $7.8 million was included for projects in our district,” said Rep. Sewell. “By including funding for these projects, House Democrats are bypassing bureaucracy and getting money directly into the community where it’s needed. I am hopeful that the Senate will swiftly approve this funding and I look forward to seeing President Biden sign it into law.”\\nIn April, Rep. Sewell submitted requests to the House Appropriations Committee to fund\\xa0community projects\\xa0in Alabama’s 7th District. Funding for eight of these projects, totaling\\xa0$7,829,355, was included in House Democrats’ appropriations package that passed in the House this week. The bills will now make their way to the Senate where they will face additional negotiations before being passed and signed into law by President Biden. Rep. Sewell looks forward to her other community project funding requests being included in Appropriations bills still pending before the House of Representatives.\\nRep. Sewell secured funding, totaling $7,829,355.00, for the following community projects in the House’s government funding bills:\\n*NOTE: Funding for these projects must still be passed by the Senate.\\n\\nJefferson County - Greater Shiloh Baptist Church - Employment and Training Project\\n\\nRecipient: Cornerstone Revitalization Foundation, Inc.\\nAward: $1,500,000.00\\nProject: To reduce recidivism, CWD will afford adults ages 25 and older opportunities to learn trade and technical skills. Participants will also have the opportunity to get their GED and pursue post-secondary education opportunities and help with obtaining affordable housing. The program is about assisting participants with not just jobs but careers.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nJefferson County - North Birmingham Community Development Rehabilitation Project\\n\\nRecipient: City of Birmingham\\nAward: $3,000,000.00\\nProject: The North Birmingham Community has suffered from environmental justice concerns for over a century. A largely redlined area, the community includes multiple coal refinement operations, the 35th Avenue Superfund site, and parts of the community sustain flood damage regularly. This project would remove environmental concerns in the old North Birmingham Elementary School.\\xa0The redevelopment of the North Birmingham site would provide a transformative redevelopment investment in North Birmingham.\\n\\n\\nJefferson County - Small Business Accelerator Program\\n\\nRecipient: Central Alabama Redevelopment Alliance\\nAward: $474,355.00\\nProject: The Small Business Accelerator provides micro companies and small businesses access to instructional workshops, key resource providers, and other support to help them expand and create jobs for the local community.\\xa0The Accelerator helps Alabama small businesses establish core systems and processes that would allow their business to survive a natural disaster, economic downturn, or other business interruptions.\\n\\n\\nLowndes County - Wastewater Disposal Treatment System Project\\n\\nRecipient: Lowndes County Unincorporated Wastewater Program\\nAward: $700,000.00\\nProject: Failing septic tanks and deteriorating wastewater infrastructure in Lowndes County have left many families with untreated sewage in their yards and in local waterways.\\xa0This is not only an infrastructure crisis, but a healthcare crisis. This funding would facilitate the installation of septic tanks for homes in unincorporated areas without proper wastewater disposal systems.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nPerry County – Drinking Water Infrastructure Project\\n\\nRecipient: City of Marion\\nAward: $480,000.00\\nProject: The improvement of the City of Marion’s water infrastructure is critical to the health and economic vitality of the community. Failures of the water system after recent natural disasters have threatened the continued operation of local institutions like Marion Military Institute and Judson College. These funds will help provide functional water systems to a community that is combating intergenerational poverty in the Black Belt.\\n\\n\\nSumter County - Hill Hospital Construction Project\\n\\nRecipient: Hill Hospital\\nAward: $575,000.00\\nProject: For several years, Hill Hospital has faced persistent challenges to provide comprehensive health care to the citizens in Sumter County. Geographic isolation, economic fluctuations, and the COVID 19 pandemic have magnified these challenges. This funding will improve the facilities and patient rooms at Hill Hospital so they can continue to serve the county and provide healthcare to the rural community. The long-term viability of Hill Hospital will prevent residents from traveling to other counties and states to seek health care.\\n\\n\\nTuscaloosa County - Community Health Worker Initiative\\n\\nRecipient: West Central Alabama Area Health Education Center\\nAward: $300,000.00\\nProject: The Community Health Worker Initiative will develop and implement a training program throughout Alabama to improve access to healthcare, increase community resilience, and promote health education in rural areas.\\xa0Nearly half of Alabama’s state population lives in a rural county, and on average, those individuals are more likely to be low-income, uninsured, and suffer from higher rates of chronic health conditions.\\xa0This program will help aid these communities while also addressing the primary care, dental, and mental health workforce shortage in Alabama.\\n\\n\\nTuscaloosa County -\\xa0TRAMS CORE Improvement of Postsecondary Education\\n\\nRecipient: Stillman College\\nAward: $800,000.00\\nProject: The Translational and Mechanistic Science for Collaborative Organic Research Environment (TRAMS CORE) program addresses traditional roadblocks for research and will provide a platform to generate new research efforts on the campus of a HBCU. Subsequently, the successful integration of shared resources will support continued growth in biomedical research in the community. This proposal is part of a long-term commitment toward the development and sustainability of biomedical research facilities at Stillman College.',\n",

The bill passed the House in a final vote of 359-57-1.\\n\\xa0\\n“I voted for today’s legislation to avert a catastrophic government shutdown and fund the critical programs that my constituents depend on. At a time when our country is in the middle of a pandemic and millions of Americans are losing their homes and livelihoods to natural disasters, including hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, our government needs to be fully funded and operational so that the American people can get the resources they need,” said Rep. Sewell. “I am particularly proud of the provisions Democrats secured to save our seniors from a Medicare Part B premium hike, protect health, housing, and other programs for Veterans, and to provide repayment relief for our health care providers at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic.”\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n“While I’m disappointed that Senate Republicans and White House didn’t come to the table to agree to pass the long-term FY2021 funding bills that the House passed earlier this year, I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure a long-term funding bill is passed before this CR expires in December. Additionally, an agreement on further Coronavirus relief legislation is desperately needed. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs and as the pandemic continues, municipalities, health care providers, essential workers, and small businesses are running out of resources from the CARES Act and relief is needed now.”\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nA list of the programs that Congresswoman Sewell worked directly with House appropriators to secure in the FY2020 funding bill, which are extended by today’s continuing resolution, H.R. 8337, can be found here.

By ending the defense sequester, modernizing our military force for the future, and rebuilding our military readiness, the National Defense Authorization Act makes good on our commitment to preserve our national security and support our service members. I am particularly pleased to see that this bill prioritizes the readiness of U.S. Cyber Command, cyber mission forces, and cyber warfare tools and capabilities, including initiatives to strengthen the cyber workforce and strengthen congressional oversight of these capabilities.”\\n“While I am supportive of the funding allocated to these critically important defense programs, I continue to have strong concerns about Congress’ inability to make difficult funding decisions as it relates to our national security priorities. Ultimately, I am deeply concerned that many of these initiatives will potentially be funded at the expense of vital domestic spending programs. While robust funding of our national security is paramount, it is equally as important that we continue to provide essential funding for domestic programs that help educate our children, ensure every American has access to quality and affordable healthcare, and repair our deteriorating infrastructure.”\\nThe National Defense Authorization Act for FY18 authorizes $631.5 billion for base budget requirements as well as $64.6 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.

We owe a debt of gratitude to the brave Foot Soldiers who dared to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in the face of extreme racial hostility. We should never forget the sacrifices they made so this nation could live up to its ideals of equality and justice for all. The Congressional Gold medal is a great reminder of the power of ordinary Americans to collectively achieve extraordinary social change.

Martha Roby.\\nAbout the Congressional Gold Medal\\nSince the American Revolution, Congress has commissioned gold medals as its highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions by individuals or institutions. The medal was first awarded in 1776 by the second Continental Congress to General George Washington.\\nAbout the March from Selma to Montgomery in 1965\\nCivil rights activists were brutally attacked by Alabama state troopers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma on March 7, 1965. This day, now known as Bloody Sunday, was the first of three planned, peaceful protests from Selma to Montgomery. Nearly 2,500 Foot Soldiers led by Dr. Martin Luther King attempted a second march two days later on March 9, 1965, now known as “Turnaround Tuesday.” An estimated 8,000 Foot Soldiers left Selma on March 21, 1965, and successfully marched to Montgomery to peacefully protest restrictive voting laws that prevented African-Americans from voting in the South.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor more information about our releases, please contact Deshundra Jefferson (Washington, DC) at 202.225.2665 or Aneesa McMillan (Birmingham) at 205.254.1960.',\n",

A nomination of these sites to the World Heritage List would further recognize the pain, redemption and healing associated with these historical sites and honor the civil rights heroes who bravely sat, marched and fought to secure equality for all Americans.”\\nIf designated, the sites would join other cultural and natural sites of universal importance, such as Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona, the Taj Mahal in India, and the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador on the World Heritage List.\\nOther civil rights sites announced by the Interior Department for potential nomination include: Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas; Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia; Monroe Elementary School in Topeka, Kansas; Medgar and Myrlie Evers Home in Jackson, Mississippi; Robert Russa Moton High School/Museum in Farmville, Virginia; and Lincoln Memorial and Grounds in Washington, D.C.\\nThe Interior Department will collaborate with partners and consult with the Federal Interagency Panel for World Heritage on the completed document before making a final decision on whether to submit the nomination for the Civil Rights Movement Sites to the World Heritage Committee.

       "  'text': 'Washington D.C. — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07), Ranking Member of the Committee on House Administration’s Subcommittee on Elections, spoke on the House Floor in strong opposition to H.R. 8281, House Republicans’ so-called “SAVE Act.” The bill would make it substantially more difficult for millions of Americans to cast their ballots and unnecessarily sow doubt about the integrity of America’s elections. Rep. Sewell offered a motion to recommit the bill back to the Committee on House Administration and called on House leadership to instead consider H.R. 14, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.\\nWatch it on YouTube here.\\nRep. Sewell: Mister Speaker, as a daughter of Selma and Representative of Alabama’s Civil Rights District, the fight for voting rights is very personal to me. It was in Selma where hundreds of Foot Soldiers like John Lewis shed blood on a bridge for the equal right of all Americans to vote. They marched, they bled, they prayed, and some even died for the right to vote.\\nMister Speaker, the legislation before us today makes a mockery of their legacy. House Republicans’ so-called “SAVE Act” is a dangerous, anti-democratic bill that would do nothing to protect our elections.\\nWhile our colleagues across the aisle claim that this bill would prevent non-citizens from voting, we know that it is already illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections. In fact, under current law, non-citizens would face up to 5 years in prison for attempting to vote in federal elections, and even risk being deported.\\nIn reality, this legislation would purge thousands of eligible voters from the rolls including Americans who recently got married and changed their last names and those with military and tribal IDs.\\nAmericans should see this bill for what it is, a cynical attempt to sow doubt in the minds of voters about the integrity of our elections. It is yet another attempt to fan the flames of election denial by the same extremists who brought us the January 6th insurrection.\\nMister Speaker, we are elected officials who should be fighting to protect and expand access to the ballot box, not restrict it. We should be working to advance the progress made by the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Movements, rather than rolling it back.\\nBut let’s be clear, the biggest threat to our elections is not non-citizen voting. It is the lack of federal oversight which has allowed for states to advance hundreds of new laws and new bills making it harder for Americans to vote.\\nMister Speaker, the House should be considering H.R. 14, the John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which I introduced in September.\\nH.R. 14 would restore federal oversight. It would establish a new formula to prevent states with a recent history of voter discrimination from restricting voter access. In doing so, it would protect access to the ballot box for every eligible American.\\nWith state lawmakers working overtime to erect barriers to the ballot box, the need for federal voting rights protections is just as urgent today as it was 60 years ago. After all, it is up to the voters to choose our elected leaders, not the other way around.\\nNever did I think that 60 years after John Lewis was bludgeoned on a bridge in my hometown of Selma, Alabama, that I would be fighting to restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\\nIt goes to show that progress is elusive and every generation must fight to preserve the progress of the past and to advance it.\\nJohn Lewis didn’t give up and neither will we.\\nMister Speaker, House Republicans’ so-called SAVE Act is a dangerous, anti-democratic bill that has no place on this floor.\\nIs it for that reason that at the appropriate time, I will be offering a motion to recommit this bill back to the committee.\\nI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Motion to Recommit.\\nThank you, and I yield back the balance of my time.\\n\\xa0###',\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) was joined by House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark (MA-05), House Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar (CA-33), Rep. James Clyburn (SC-06), Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse (CO-02), and Congressional Hispanic Caucus Deputy Chairman Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) for a press conference on the 11th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Shelby County v. Holder decision. Rep. Sewell and her colleagues called on Congress to restore the full protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act by passing the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.\\nWatch it on YouTube here.\\nRep. Sewell: Good afternoon, everyone. I’m Congresswoman Terri Sewell. I proudly represent Alabama’s 7th Congressional District which includes the historic cities of Birmingham, Montgomery, and my hometown of Selma, Alabama.\\nI’m honored to be joined by House Democratic leadership team as well as members of the Tri-Caucus as we draw attention to the need for federal legislation to protect voting rights.\\nIt was 11 years ago when the Supreme Court’s conservative majority gutted the heart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, eliminating voter protections and removing federal oversight from states with a proven track record of voter discrimination.\\nThe consequences of the Shelby decision have been clear and devastating: long lines at the polling stations, strict ID requirements, closed polling stations in communities of color without notice, bans on early voting and absentee voting, and purging of voter rolls. The list goes on and on.\\nSince the Shelby decision, we have seen 31 states institute at least 103 new laws to restrict voting access, and it is no surprise that those laws disproportionately target Black and minority voters.\\nIn my home state of Alabama, lawmakers have made it a felony to assist someone with an absentee ballot.\\nThese laws may not be new. They are not new. They are part of a borrowed old playbook and they’re having devastating effects on African American communities and minority voters all across America. While Black voters may not need to count the number of jelly beans in a jar, modern-day barriers to voting are just as pernicious as the poll taxes and literacy tests of the past.\\nIn the Shelby decision, the Supreme Court was clear that the onus was on Congress to come up with a modern-day formula to determine which states should be subject to federal oversight. Well, I’m proud to say that we have done just that, and we’ve called it after our beloved former colleague, John Lewis.\\xa0\\nWorking together with our nation’s premiere civil rights and voting rights organizations, we have come up with a modern-day formula to ensure states and localities with a recent history of voter discrimination are prohibited from restricting voting access. We even named it after our former colleague, John Lewis.\\nThe John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which we introduced for the fifth time in September, would protect the right of every American to vote. But despite our efforts, our colleagues across the aisle have continued to block us from even considering the bill.\\nThe fact that the Voting Rights Act has become a partisan issue is frankly baffling to me. You see, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has been reauthorized five times since 1965, and three times under Republican presidents. Most recently in 2006, George W. Bush signed the Voting Rights Reauthorization Act.\\nYet instead of working with us to restore its protections, our Republican colleagues have instead chosen to spread disinformation and sow seeds of doubt about the integrity of our elections. We as elected officials should be working to ensure that all Americans are able to vote, instead of picking and choosing those who have access to the ballot box.\\xa0\\nYou see, this fight is very personal to me. I grew up in Selma, Alabama, and representing that historic city and what happened on that bridge almost 60 years ago is very personal to me. We know that John Lewis was bludgeoned on a bridge for the equal right of all Americans to vote. We also know that it will be 60 years next year. 60 years after those Foot Soldiers were bludgeoned on the bridge, their cause has become our cause too. Who would’ve ever thought that progress would be so backwards that we would be having the same fight that they had 60 years ago?\\nYou know, it was 60 years ago that they prayed, they protested, they bled, and some even died for the right to vote. It was their sacrifices that gave us the Voting Rights Act of 1965. And I dare say that the Voting Rights Act of 1965, along with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, are crown jewels of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Movements.\\nThose Foot Soldiers were ordinary Americans who had the audacity to make this nation live up to its highest ideals of equality and justice for all. Their legacy, their legacy of courage and sacrifice, is what we stand on today.\\nNever did I think that the cause for which they sacrificed would become our cause. It goes to show that progress is elusive, and every generation must hold on to the progress of the past and try to work to advance it.\\nOur vote is our voice, and our democracy is strongest when every American is able to make their voices heard at the ballot box.\\nWe are not asking anyone to put their lives on the line. We are simply asking that our Republican colleagues have the political courage to do what is right.\\nI want to thank my colleagues for joining me today and I’m honored to introduce our Democratic Whip, Katherine Clark.\\n###',\n",

Altogether, 33 marchers were hospitalized, and nearly one hundred were arrested.\\nIt was the largest assault and invasion of a Black church by law enforcement during the Civil Rights Movement.\\nThough lesser known, the events of Bloody Tuesday set the stage for Bloody Sunday and the eventual march from Selma to Montgomery.\\nI commend the Tuscaloosa SCLC for their work to keep the memory of Bloody Tuesday alive.\\nI ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating the 60th anniversary of Bloody Tuesday. We must never ever forget.\\n\\xa0###',\n",

       "  'title': 'On National Voter Registration Day, Rep. Sewell and House Democrats Introduce the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act',\n",
       "  'date': 'September 19, 2023',\n",
       "  'text': 'Legislation would protect the right to vote and safeguard our democracy against attacks by MAGA extremists\\nWashington, D.C. – Today, on National Voter Registration Day, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07), Ranking Member of House Administration Committee Subcommittee on Elections, led every House Democrat in introducing H.R. 14, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The bill would protect the right to vote and safeguard our democracy by restoring and modernizing the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA). Ten years ago, the Supreme Court gutted the VRA and unleashed a wave of discriminatory state laws targeting voters and restricting voting access. By restoring the VRA’s authority, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would prevent such laws from taking effect in states and localities with a recent history of voter discrimination.\\n“Generations of Americans—many in my hometown of Selma, Alabama—marched, fought, and even died for the equal right of all Americans to vote,” said Rep. Terri Sewell, lead sponsor. “But today, their legacy and our very democracy are under attack as MAGA extremists target voters with new laws to restrict voting access. Ten years after the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the fight for voting rights has never been more urgent. The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement would protect the right to vote and safeguard our democracy by restoring and modernizing the protections of the Voting Rights Act. It would prevent restrictive, discriminatory voting laws from taking effect and ensure every eligible American can have their vote cast and counted.”\\nFor decades, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) prevented states and localities with a history of voter discrimination from restricting voting access by requiring such jurisdictions to preclear new election laws with the Department of Justice or a U.S. District Court. However, in its disastrous 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court gutted the law and struck down the formula used to determine which jurisdictions are subject to federal oversight. In July 2021, the Court further weakened the law in its decision in Brnovich v. DNC, making it more difficult to challenge discriminatory voting laws under Section 2.\\nIn the decade since the Supreme Court gutted the VRA, state legislators have advanced hundreds of new restrictive, discriminatory voting laws targeting minorities, young adults, and the elderly. Among other restrictions, these laws have closed polling stations, curbed early voting and voting by mail, imposed strict identification requirements, limited multi-lingual voting materials, and made it harder to register to vote. In 2023, state legislators passed a near-record number of new restrictive voting laws, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\\nNamed for the late Congressman and civil rights icon, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would protect the right to vote and safeguard our democracy by restoring and modernizing the full protections of the VRA. The bill would establish a new, modern-day framework to determine which states and localities have a recent history of discrimination and require such jurisdictions to preclear new election changes, preventing restrictive and discriminatory voting laws from taking effect. The bill also restores Section 2 of the VRA by eliminating the heightened standard required to challenge discriminatory voting laws created by the Supreme Court in Brnovich v. DNC.\\n“The right to vote is sacred, it is central to the very integrity of our democracy,” said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. “Unfortunately, extreme MAGA Republicans have decided that the only way they can win elections is to engage in massive voter suppression. It’s unconscionable, it’s unacceptable and un-American. The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act will help ensure that every American has access to the ballot box so we can crush this epidemic of voter suppression once and for all.”\\n“Nearly sixty years after John Lewis marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the sacred right to vote is still under threat. Since the January 6th attack, MAGA extremists have introduced hundreds of voter suppression bills in state legislatures — all to strengthen their power at the expense of the American people,” said House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark. “Today, Democrats are reintroducing the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, under the steadfast leadership of Congresswoman Terri Sewell. This legislation will preserve and protect our nation’s greatest treasure of free and fair elections for all. This is a call to action for Congressional Republicans: do you stand with Americans in the fight for democracy, or against us?”\\n“The right to vote is a sacred cornerstone of our democracy. My dear friend John Lewis recognized this and dedicated his life to expanding access to the ballot box. I’m proud to continue the fight and honor his memory by joining Rep. Sewell in reintroducing the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act,” said Assistant House Democratic Leader James E. Clyburn. “We have a moral obligation to make this country’s greatness accessible and affordable for all Americans; fundamental to that mission is including all Americans in our great democracy. Congressional Democrats will always remain committed to this cause and urge our Republican colleagues to reconsider their partisan opposition to protecting the franchise.”\\n“The right to vote is the bedrock of our American democracy, and it is under threat. The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, together with the Freedom to Vote Act, will restore those protections, strengthen our democracy, and ensure every eligible voter has their voice heard,” said Committee on House Administration Ranking Member Joseph Morelle. “I’m a son of Rochester, New York, the home of two passionate and inspiring voting rights advocates, Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony. Today, we honor their legacy, and the legacy of Congressman John Lewis, and continue the fight to help bring America closer to its foundational promise.”\\n“Voting rights are under renewed and sustained assault across the country and we must pass this bill now to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act,” said House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jerrold Nadler. “After a series of troubling Supreme Court rulings, which have enabled voter suppression efforts by states and localities, the need for a revitalized Voting Rights Act has never been greater. I hope Congress will honor the sacrifices of those who marched, struggled, and even died to secure the right to vote and will rediscover the bipartisan spirit that once animated our work to protect the rights of all Americans to vote.”\\n“As we speak, extreme MAGA Republicans at the local, state, and national levels are running the table with every tactic in their arsenal to keep Black voters from the ballot box. These efforts are coordinated and well-funded and they are targeting our communities with precision,” said Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Steven Horsford. “Protecting Americans’ access to democracy should not be a partisan issue, and yet, time and again we have seen Republicans walk away from the formerly bipartisan commitment of ensuring access to the ballot box for all. The CBC is calling on Republicans to work with Democrats to pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and to put people over politics.”\\xa0\\n“After the devastating Shelby v. Holder Supreme Court decision gutting key components of the Voting Rights Act a decade ago, certain states have criminalized individuals and groups assisting with voter registration, and withdrawn or denied the use of multilingual ballots and translators at the polls,” said Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chairwoman Judy Chu. “These shameless voter disenfranchisement tactics especially hurt those in the AANHPI community—over a third of whom are limited English proficient and need multilingual support to exercise their right to vote. These and other voter suppression efforts like aggressive gerrymandering, restrictive voter ID laws, polling location closures, and restrictions on early voting weaken our democracy by limiting who can make their voices heard. That is why Congress must do its job and pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to protect and strengthen the right of all Americans—regardless of race, age, or language proficiency—to vote and have a say in our democracy.”\\n“As states across the country ramp up their enactment of voter suppression laws, we must put in place a new framework for voting protections and voter empowerment that safeguards every American’s ability to participate in our democracy,” said Rep. John Sarbanes, Co- Chair of the Task Force on Strengthening Democracy. “I am proud to honor the sacrifices my colleague and friend, Congressman John Lewis, and the other brave foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement made 58 years ago by joining in the introduction of this legislation to strengthen every voter’s access to the ballot box, regardless of their zip code, and build a democracy that uplifts the voices of all Americans.”\\nBill text is available here.',\n",

Sewell. “But today, their legacy—and democracy itself—is under attack by extremists and election deniers who are working to subvert our elections and make it harder for Americans to vote.”\\n“The Freedom to Vote Act protects the right to vote, supports local election workers, bans dark money, and ends partisan gerrymandering,” continued Sewell. “Together with the John R.

It sets minimum, nationwide standards for voting opportunities by setting a uniform floor of days and hours for early voting; setting minimum standards for access to ballot drop boxes; a nationwide standard of no-excuse absentee voting; and improves delivery of election mail. It also improves access for voters with disabilities and military and overseas voters.\\n\\n\\nPrevents State Election Subversion: The Freedom to Vote Act supports election workers and establishes federal protections to insulate nonpartisan election officials who administer federal elections from undue partisan interference or control.\\n\\n\\nCombats Dark Money and Ends Gerrymandering: The Freedom to Vote Act requires super PACs, 501(c)(4) groups, and other organizations spending money in elections to disclose donors and shuts down the use of transfers between organizations to cloak the identity of contributors. It also ends partisan gerrymandering and establishes specific criteria for congressional redistricting to ensure nonpartisan redistricting.\\n\\nThe bill comes as MAGA extremists continue to spread misinformation about our elections, with some refusing to even accept the results. They have also passed a wave of laws restricting the freedom to vote in states across the country, while a growing flood of corporate and dark money pollute our elections and drown out the voices of regular people.\\nFind more information about the Freedom to Vote Act here.',\n",

Sewell’s opening remarks.\\nOpening Statement: “Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\\n\\n“As the Chair acknowledged, Ranking Member Morelle is unable to be here today due to a death in his family.\\n\\n“I know we all offer him our sincerest condolences.\\xa0\\n\\n“Today we are discussing state tools to promote voter confidence. To do so, we must acknowledge a truth.\\n\\n“Perpetuating falsehoods about stolen or insecure elections undermines our confidence.\\n\\n“Acknowledging and alleging a lack of voter confidence or lack of integrity in the electoral system is a false justification to rationalize enactment of suppressive voter laws and procedures such as eliminating ballot drop box, restricting mail in voting, enacting suppressive voter ID laws, and discriminatory voter list maintenance practices that result in otherwise eligible voters being removed from the rolls.\\n\\n“Instead, confidence in election means every eligible voter feels confident that they can access and cast a ballot, that that ballot will be counted and that it was counted as cast.\\xa0\\n\\n“When voters see voting methods their communities have been using for decades suddenly being attacked without evidence, it does not promote voter confidence.\\n\\n“Indeed, ensuring eligible voters have access to the franchise promotes voter confidence.\\n\\n“One of the most critical tools states have to promote voter confidence are well trained, well-resourced election officials, people who administer elections year after year are known in their communities and who voters can turn to for accurate information.\\n\\n“However, these trusted public servants have become the targets of harassment and threats.\\n\\n“A survey of local election officials published earlier this year by the Brennan Center for Justice found that nearly 3 in 4 feel that threats against election officials have increased in recent years, and 30% say that they have personally been abused, harassed or threatened because of their job.\\n\\n“The survey also found that given the rate at which officials are leaving the profession, we can expect more than 1 in 5 local election officials to be serving in their first presidential election in 2024.\\n\\n“We need to ensure that these officials have the training and resources needed to carry out the critical work of administering our elections.\\n\\n“Our democracy does not function without them.\\n\\n“As we discussed at a committee hearing last month, election officials have worked hard and made significant strides to increase transparency in the electoral process and provide opportunities for the public to better understand and understand what can otherwise be a cumbersome and hard process.\\n\\n“The Supreme Court has found that voting is a fundamental political right because it is preservative of all rights and Congress has broad powers to legislate under the election clause.\\n\\n“We should be making it easier to vote.\\xa0\\n\\n“As elected officials we should be making sure that access to the ballot box is easy. We also must be truthful.\\xa0\\n\\n“There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the United States elections. It is already hard to cheat and committing fraud, committing acts of fraud, voter fraud is already against the law.\\n\\n“Continuing to perpetuate false claims of rigged elections undermines voter confidence.\\n\\n“Passing laws that restrict voters access to the ballot box undermines voter confidence.\\n\\n“Casting election officials as a part of a conspiracy to steal an election undermines voter confidence.\\n\\n“Since the founding of our country, large segments of the American people have been intentionally excluded from the right to vote, and their access to the ballot box has been purposefully curtailed.\\n\\n“Claiming that higher voter turnout numbers mean restrictive voting laws do not have suppressive or discriminatory effect, while ignoring evidence of significant racial turnout gaps, that undermines voter confidence.\\n\\n“While many minority communities overwhelmed by barriers to casting their vote, it does not make those barriers fair.\\n\\n“It certainly does not justify or validate their existence.\\xa0\\n\\n“This committee's role in conducting oversight of federal elections is critical.\\xa0\\n\\n“We must work to protect access to the ballot box, ensure states and localities have the funding and resources they need to conduct free and fair elections.\\n\\n“Protect election workers from harassment and threats.\\xa0\\n\\n“I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses, Mr. Chair, and the discussion to follow. Thanks.”\",\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07), Ranking Member of the Committee on House Administration Subcommittee on Elections, delivered her opening statement during the Subcommittee's first hearing of the 118th Congress, entitled\\xa0Successes in the 2022 Midterm Elections.\\xa0As Ranking Member, Sewell serves as the highest-ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the administration of federal elections.\\nClick\\xa0here\\xa0to watch the full hearing. Click\\xa0here\\xa0to watch Rep. Sewell’s opening statement.\\nOpening Statement (As Prepared):\\xa0Good morning. As the new Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Elections, I would like to thank Chairwoman Lee for welcoming us all this morning, and I look forward to working with her and all my fellow colleagues on the Subcommittee.\\nProviding oversight over federal election administration and ensuring every American has free and equitable access to the ballot is vital to our democracy.\\xa0\\nI represent Alabama’s Seventh Congressional District, a district with a long, storied history in this country’s struggle for free and fair access to the ballot. I am excited to join this Committee and continue this critical work.\\nLast weekend we marked the 58th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in my hometown of Selma with President Biden, a bipartisan delegation of Members of Congress, civil rights leaders, and many of the surviving Foot Soldiers of the March from Selma to Montgomery.\\xa0 This annual pilgrimage serves as a reminder that the violent struggle for voting rights and equal access to the ballot is not one of the distant past. As we sit here today discussing the 2022 midterm elections, we must not lose sight of the fact that the struggle for equal voting rights that occurred on the Edmund Pettus Bridge 58 years ago, continues today.\\nThere were successes in the 2022 midterms, to be sure. Millions of Americans cast their ballots, those ballots were counted, and election workers across the country performed admirably despite the threats and harassment they have faced over the last two years.\\nThe election was secure, as it was in 2020.\\nThose who continued perpetuating the Big Lie that the last presidential election was stolen, and who traffic in falsehoods about the security of our elections lost many of their races for critical statewide offices.\\nFurthermore, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, in 2022 at least 12 states enacted laws that expand access to the vote.\\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum, however, the Brennan Center found that another 12 states enacted restrictive or election interference legislation. We should applaud increases in voter turnout, not respond to them with new restrictions.\\nAdditionally, while many minority communities overcame barriers to cast their ballot - it does not make those barriers fair, and it certainly does not justify or validate their existence.\\nIn the years since the Supreme Court’s egregious decision in Shelby County v. Holder, states with a history of voter discrimination are no longer required to preclear their voting laws to ensure they are not discriminatory, allowing a wave of anti-voter laws to be adopted across the country. Today, the Supreme Court continues to dismantle the Voting Rights Act.\\nI am proud to be the lead sponsor of the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, a bill that would update and reinstate the full force of the Voting Rights Act, a law that protected voters from discrimination for more than 50 years. Additionally, House Democrats have repeatedly passed pro-democracy legislation that would protect voters’ access to the ballot.\\nGenerations of Americans fought for the sacred right to vote, overcoming barriers and violence to move us forward in the fight for democracy. The people of Alabama and this country have marched, bled, been jailed, and sometimes died, for the right to vote.\\nThe work we do as Members of Congress and as members of this Committee should honor their legacy.\\nI look forward to hearing from our witnesses today and the discussion to follow.\\nThank you, Chairwoman Lee, and I yield back.\",\n",

Biden, Jr. to Selma, Alabama, to commemorate the 58th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. Rep. Sewell invited President Biden to visit Selma during his 2023 State of the Union Address.

Sewell’s request to increase the federal cost share for FEMA’s public assistance program—including funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures—from 75% to 100% following the January 12th storms.\\n“I am thrilled that President Biden has accepted my invitation to visit Selma for the 58th anniversary of Bloody Sunday,” celebrated Rep. Sewell. “As Selma continues to recover from the January 12th storms, President Biden’s presence will send a clear message that our community is not alone and shows that the federal government will continue to be a partner in rebuilding Selma and Dallas County. I look forward to welcoming the President to my hometown as we reflect on the sacrifices of the Foot Soldiers in the name of equality and justice for all.”\\nAdditional details are forthcoming.',\n",

       "  'date': 'June 8, 2022',\n",
       "  'text': \"Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined Rep. Nikema Williams (GA-05), Bobby Scott (VA-03), Colin Allred (TX-32), Carolyn Bourdeaux (GA-07), and Marc Veasey (TX-33) in introducing the Sustaining Our Democracy Act. This bill would provide $20 billion in mandatory federal funding over the next decade to help states and local governments support election administration, including by training and recruiting nonpartisan poll workers and election officials and increasing access to voting in underserved communities. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) introduced companion legislation in the Senate.\\xa0\\n“Over the past two years, extremist politicians have sought to undermine trust in our elections to serve their own craven political ambitions,” said Rep. Sewell. “Across the nation, local election administrators have borne the brunt of this assault which threatens the very fabric of our democracy. By providing a steady stream of funding for election administration, the Sustaining Our Democracy Act would ensure that states and localities have the resources they need to administer free and fair elections. In doing so, it would help restore much-needed trust in the democratic process. As state legislatures continue their assault on the right to vote, enacting federal voting rights legislation continues to be my top priority!”\\n“Georgia's non-partisan election workers are instrumental to free elections,” said Rep. Nikema Williams, lead sponsor. “We must keep it that way. Elections and election workers in Georgia are under furious assault by the former President and Republicans who want to silence Black and brown voters. My bill will help hardworking local elections officials have all the resources they need to defend our democracy. With the very soul of the country at sake, there are no two sides to this issue. You are either on the side of democracy or you aren't.”\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Nothing is more important than the integrity of our democracy, and our election administration should be efficient and free from partisan interference,” said Rep. Colin Allred. “As a former voting rights attorney, I know that our free and fair elections are what set American democracy apart, and we must protect it. It’s why I am proud to help lead this bill that will invest in election security and help eligible voters cast their ballot.”\\n“Too many communities lack the funding to maintain their election infrastructure, leading to errors that degrade trust in and restrict access to our elections,” said Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux. “This legislation ensures local elections boards have predictable and consistent funding. As someone who has seen firsthand how dangerous it can be when election systems fail us, this funding will ensure we don’t face the same breakdowns we experienced across Georgia in 2018 and 2020.”\\n“With this year’s midterm election cycle already underway, we are reminded how important it is for Congress to provide adequate funding to support both our nation’s electoral system and election officials who ensure the durability and integrity of our democratic process,” said Rep. Marc Veasey. “That is why it is critical we continue investing in our aging voting infrastructure and provide much-needed funding to assist election officials and poll workers. As Co-Chair of the Voting Rights Caucus, I’ll keep supporting reasonable efforts that ensure Americans cast their votes.”\\n“Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of our democracy, but in recent years we have seen a barrage of threats seeking to undermine our elections,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar. “It is critical that we respond to these threats head-on by ensuring that state and local governments have the resources needed to strengthen the administration of our elections, protect election officials on the frontlines, and provide all eligible voters with the opportunity to make their voices heard. From training more election workers to expanding polling places to making it easier for voters to cast ballots early and by mail, this legislation helps provide state and local governments with the funding they need to effectively administer elections and eliminate barriers to voting. I’ll keep fighting to make our democracy work for every American.”\\nThe Sustaining our Democracy Act enjoys the support of 23 original cosponsors in the House of Representatives. It is endorsed by numerous organizations including: National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, Asian Americans Advancing Justice - AAJC, End Citizens United/Let America Vote, Common Cause, Fair Fight Action, National Action Network, Spread the Vote, Southern Coalition for Social Justice, and Asian American Advocacy Fund.\\nClick here for the text of the Sustaining our Democracy Act.\",\n",

We can be frustrated. We can be downright mad. But we must never be deterred.\\n“Tonight, I’m reminded of the words of the late, great Congressman John Lewis as he stood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge for the final time just four months before his passing. He said, ‘I want to thank each and every one of you for being here; for not giving up; for not giving in; for keeping the faith; for keeping your eyes on the prize.’\\n“Just as John picked himself back up after being bludgeoned on that bridge for the right of all Americans to vote, so too must we pick ourselves up and continue this fight.

In doing so, it would prevent states and localities with a recent history of voter discrimination from restricting the right to vote by requiring such jurisdictions to obtain pre-clearance from the Department of Justice before changing election laws. The bill passed the House of Representatives in August 2021 by a vote of 219-213.\\nThe Freedom to Vote Act: The Senate-introduced Freedom to Vote Act sets basic nationwide standards for how elections are conducted and ensures that the voices of all Americans are heard.

       "  'date': 'December 20, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': 'Grove Hill, AL - Today, Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) continued her “Building a Better Alabama” Infrastructure District Tour stopping in Choctaw County and Clarke counties to highlight the transformational funding from the $1 trillion bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Rep. Sewell also gave a full update on her bill, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which passed the House in August and is currently sitting in the Senate.\\xa0\\nThe “Building a Better Alabama” Infrastructure District Tour is a series of roundtable discussions, constituency meetings, and site visits throughout Alabama’s 7th Congressional District to connect with constituents and local elected officials and discuss the transformational funding from the $1 trillion bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\\n“Today, I was proud to stop in Choctaw and Clarke counties to discuss this once-in-a-lifetime funding from the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and give a full update on the great things we’ve accomplished in Congress so far this year,” said Rep. Sewell. “As a proud daughter of Alabama’s Black Belt, I know firsthand that with resources and opportunities, our communities can thrive. With this infrastructure law, President Biden and Congressional Democrats have accomplished what other administrations have tried to do for decades, and I’m confident that its targeted investments will combat historic inequities that have plagued this district for so many years.”\\nThe bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will:\\n\\nCreate Millions of Good-Paying Jobs - Together with the Build Back Better Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will create an average of 2 million jobs per year over the course of the next decade.\\nRepair and Rebuild Alabama’s Roads and Bridges - The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Alabama would expect to receive:\\n\\n$5.2 billion for federal-aid highway apportioned programs\\n$225 million for bridge replacement and repairs under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act over five years.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nConnect Every Alabamian to High-speed Internet - Broadband internet is necessary for Alabamians to do their jobs, participate equally in school learning, health care, and to stay connected. Yet 18% of Alabama households do not have an internet subscription, and 11.5% of Alabama residents live in areas where, under the FCC’s benchmark, there is no broadband infrastructure. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Alabama will receive a minimum allocation of $100 million to help provide broadband coverage across the state, including providing access to the at least 565,000 Alabamians who currently lack it. It also makes 1,518,000 Alabamians (31%) eligible for the Affordability Connectivity Benefit, which will help low-income families afford internet access.\\xa0\\nMake Transformational Investments in Alabama’s Water Infrastructure - Currently, up to 10 million American households and 400,000 schools and child care centers lack safe drinking water. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, based on the traditional state revolving fund formula, Alabama will expect to receive $782 million over five years to improve water infrastructure across the state and ensure that clean, safe drinking water is a right in all communities. The bill also includes $23 billion nationally for the bipartisan Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act.\\nImprove Healthy, Sustainable Transportation Options - Alabamians who take public transportation spend an extra 66.2% of their time commuting and non-White households are 4.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation. 25% of transit vehicles in the state are past useful life. Based on formula funding alone, Alabama would expect to receive more than $400 million over five years under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to improve public transportation options across the state.\\n\\nAlabama can also compete for the $12.5 billion Bridge Investment Program for economically significant bridges and nearly $16 billion of national funding in the bill dedicated for major projects that will deliver substantial economic benefits to communities.\\nBackground on H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act:\\nOn August 24, 2021, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which Rep. Sewell introduced earlier in the month. On November 3, 2021, nearly every Senate Republican blocked debate on the Senate version of the bill.\\nThis critical legislation would restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and keep the promise of our democracy alive for all Americans. Amid the most coordinated state-level effort to restrict the right to vote in generations, H.R. 4 would prevent states and localities with a recent history of voter discrimination from restricting the right to vote by requiring these jurisdictions to obtain federal preclearance before changing their voting laws.\\nPhotos and videos from today’s events in Butler and Grove Hill can be found here.\\xa0\\nA recording of the “Building a Better Alabama” Infrastructure Town Hall in Grove Hill can be found here.',\n",

       "  'date': 'October 26, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': \"Washington, D.C. – On Monday, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) spoke on the House Floor during the Congressional Black Caucus’ Special Order Hour to call on her Senate colleagues to reform the filibuster and pass federal legislation to protect the right to vote, including her bill, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Below are Rep. Sewell’s remarks:\\nRep. Sewell: Madam Speaker, as we speak, our nation is facing the most concerted effort to restrict the right to vote in a generation.\\n\\xa0Just this year, 400 bills have been introduced in state legislatures across this nation to restrict the right to vote. And in 19 states, at least 33 of these bills have become law, including the most egregious of state legislatures, Georgia, where now it is a crime to give a bottle of water to a voter as they stand in line.\\n\\xa0Even as our very democracy comes under attack, we see Republicans standing firm in their opposition to protecting the right to vote, a bedrock principle that should never be partisan.\\n\\xa0Just last week, we watched as every Senate Republican voted to block debate on the Freedom to Vote Act, a commonsense bill that would ensure every American has access to the ballot box. What are they afraid of, I ask? What are they afraid of?\\n\\xa0Last week’s vote made clear that Senate Republicans are unwilling to even debate voting rights, let alone hold a fair vote.\\n\\xa0This just further demonstrates that in order to protest and protect our democracy and the sacred right to vote, we must reform the filibuster to create a path forward for must-pass pieces of legislation.\\nMadam Speaker, almost three weeks ago, we saw Senator Leahy introduce S. 4, the John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, in the Senate. But unless we take action on the filibuster and take action now, this critical bill will face the same fate as the Freedom to Vote Act.\\nThe way I see it —every Senator is now faced with a choice. It’s voting rights or the filibuster. It’s protecting our sacred right to vote and our democracy or the filibuster. It’s advancing the legacy of John Lewis and the Foot Soldiers or it’s the filibuster.\\nNow I know which side I’m on, and I hope our Senators will choose to do what’s right and do away with an archaic procedural rule that has been used for decades to block racial justice in this country.\\nPresident Biden also understands the urgency of this critical moment. On Thursday, at his town hall meeting, we heard President Biden express support for reforming the filibuster to pass much-needed voting rights legislation.\\nI’m glad that President Biden understands the urgency of this moment and the dire need for federal oversight. It was federal oversight that brought us the Civil Rights Act of 1965. It was federal oversight that allowed those marchers to march across that Edmund Pettus Bridge in my hometown of Selma, Alabama. When state legislatures go amuck, it’s federal oversight that we need to ensure that every American has access to the ballot box.\\nMadam Speaker, it was Foot Soldiers like our late, great colleague and my mentor, John Lewis, who shed blood on a bridge in Selma for the equal right of all Americans to vote. If protecting that sacred right is not worth overcoming a procedural rule, then what is?\\nMadam Speaker, it takes only 51 votes to sit a Supreme Court Justice. For a Supreme Court Justice to have life tenure on the Supreme Court, 51 votes. And yet, it takes 60 votes to stop debate and allow a fair vote in the United States Senate on voting rights. This is unacceptable. It’s un-American. It’s unjust. And we in the Congressional Black Caucus are saying this is our message, this is our fight: voting rights.\\nWe have no other choice. We must reform the filibuster and we must do it now\\nWhen I think about the shoulders on which we all stand, I am reminded of being in this House in 2015 during the State of the Union. I had as my special guest none other than Amelia Boynton Robinson who at that time was 103 years old. She was the oldest living Foot Soldier that marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with John Lewis and so many others. And in 2015, on the 50th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery March, she was my special guest.\\nAnd as we waited in a small room off of this chamber for Barack Obama, then President of these United States, to come and deliver that State of the Union, to a person the President’s cabinet said the same thing. Everyone wanted to take a picture with Ms. Amelia Boynton Robinson. They kneeled by her wheelchair and they said, “Oh, Miss Amelia, we stand on your shoulders. Oh, Miss Amelia, we wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for your sacrifice.”\\nWell Miss Amelia was a little tired of people saying that to her over and over again. When Eric Holder, then Attorney General of the United States, came and kneeled beside her and said, “Oh Miss Amelia I stand on your shoulders,” she said, “Get off my shoulders! All of you! Do your own work,” is what she said.\\nSo Madame Speaker, I am here to say that we, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus, are doing our own work. We’re standing firm. We’re standing solid. We're standing united in our effort to bring back the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\\nWe must do our own work, all of us. It’s not enough to say that we stand on the shoulders of giants. We know these giants. Our foremothers and our forefathers, they were tacticians. They were strategists. They didn’t just happen upon Selma, Alabama. They didn’t just happen upon Birmingham and Memphis and Atlanta. They went looking for Good Trouble. And Good Trouble they got in. We must do the same.\\nWe must take a play from their playbook. We stand firm.\\xa0 We must stand united. We must stand undeterred in our efforts to beat down any barriers that stand in the way of protecting that sacred right to vote. It was John Lewis who said that the vote is the most sacred, the most fundamental right and nonviolent tool in our democracy. THAT is the vote. The vote is fundamental to this democracy, and everything else we do will be tainted if every American lacks the right to vote.\\nThere’s nothing more sacred, more fundamental to this democracy than the right to vote. How can a procedural rule stand in the way of that right?\\nI can tell you that my constituents back home don’t understand. They don’t understand the filibuster. They don’t understand this archaic procedural rule that is in the Senate. When I tell them that it stands in the way of us passing the John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, they say why? Didn’t we go to the polls in record numbers in states all across this nation in southern states like Georgia to deliver the Democratic majority?\\nAnd they ask of us to protect that democracy now. John Lewis said that our fight is not a fight for one day. It’s not a fight for one year. Ours is a fight of a lifetime to secure that sacred right to vote.\\nWhen I close my eyes I can hear him. Can’t you hear him? John Lewis said it firmly. He said it often. When you see something that’s not right, that’s not fair, that’s not just, we have a moral obligation to stand up and do something about it.\\nWe in the Congressional Black Caucus know that our message, our fight, our cause is nothing if not to defend the sacred right to vote. It is a right that is fundamental to our democracy and that no elected official should seek to undermine or restrict any voice in this democracy.\\nOur vote is our voice in this representative democracy. When you squelch the voice of one American who has that sacred right and is unable to exercise it because the lines are too long, because their names have been purged from a role, it is a fundamental threat to all of us.\\nInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We know that. We live that. Martin Luther King told us that, but we live it every day. Nothing is more fundamental to our rights than our democracy and its foundation, its bedrock… the right to vote.\\nWhen Barack Obama finally came into that small room off of this chamber, Amelia Boynton Robinson cradled his face. I think all of us understood the import of that moment. Here was the first African American President of these United States, and here was a woman at 103 years old who made the ultimate sacrifice of being bludgeoned on a bridge, shedding blood on a bridge in MY hometown of Selma, Alabama, so that all of us would have the right to vote. That one day, she would see the fruits of her labor.\\nOh, what faith our foremothers and forefathers must’ve had. FAITH. FAITH that their sacrifices were not in vain. President Obama said, “Oh Miss Amelia, to say thank you doesn’t seem adequate. I get to give a speech as President of these United States and it’s because of you.” Without missing a beat, this woman, 103 years old and frail, said, “Oh make it a good one! That better be a very good speech.”\\nWe should make everyday a good one. We who are the inheritors of this legacy. We who are the beneficiaries of this movement. Every day should be a good one. We should not lay our head on a pillow if we have not advanced the legacy of these foremothers and forefathers.\\nEvery day should be a good one. So we call on the Senate to do what we KNOW is right. To do what John said is Good Trouble. Get into some Good Trouble. Let’s change those rules. We have it within our power to do so, after all. WE control the Senate. WE control the House. We have the White House. Gavels given to us by ordinary people who believe that we will take that power and exercise that power on THEIR behalf.\\nNothing is more fundamental than the right to vote. So in the name of John Lewis, in the name of Amelia Boynton, in the name of all of those known and unknown Foot Soldiers who had the audacity to make this nation live up to its ideals of freedom, justice, equality. Are those empty words? We must breathe life into those constitutional principles. And we can do so, if we have the will to do what we know is right.\\nA filibuster or voting rights?\\nUpholding the legacy of our foremothers and forefathers or a filibuster?\\nMaking sure that we do all that we can to protect this democracy or a filibuster?\\nThe choices are easy from where I sit. They’re easy from where our constituents sit. I ask our Senators to do what they know is right.\\nIf ever there’s a reason to reform the filibuster, it’s for that constitutionally protected right to vote. We must do so, and we must do so NOW and pass S. 4, the John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Let us restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Let us pass the Freedom to Vote Act, which after all, the first 300 pages written by John Lewis, his Empowerment Act.\\nIt’s about access to the ballot box. It’s about making sure that the least of these, the voiceless, have a voice in this democracy.\\nWe must Restore the VOTE: Voices Of The Excluded. We can do that. Congress can do that. That was what the Supreme Court said in the Shelby v. Holder decision. Only Congress can come up with a modern-day formula to secure the right to vote; to get at the most egregious state actors.\\nWe understand that we are threading a thin needle. But we have done our job, and now the Senate must do its. Let’s get rid of the filibuster. Let’s reform the filibuster at the very least, and ensure that every American has a right to vote and to ensure that their vote is counted.\\nI yield back the balance of my time.\",\n",

It’s time to draw on that same spirit of bipartisanship to protect the precious right to vote for generations to come. However, in the absence of robust Republican support, Democratic Senators must use every tool at their disposal to pass S.4 and ensure it lands on the desk of President Joe Biden.\\n“If ever there was a reason to reform the filibuster, it should be to protect our most fundamental right as American citizens, the right to vote.

Amid the most coordinated state-level effort to restrict the right to vote in generations, H.R. 4 would prevent states and localities with a recent history of voter discrimination from restricting the right to vote by requiring these jurisdictions to obtain federal preclearance before changing their voting laws. Supported by every House Democrat, H.R. 4 passed in the House of Representatives today by a vote of 219-212.\\n“Today, the House took an important step in our continued struggle to keep the promise of our democracy alive for all Americans,”\\xa0said Rep. Sewell.\\xa0“With the passage of the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act today, we’re preserving and advancing the legacy of those brave Foot Soldiers like John Lewis who shed blood on that bridge for the right of all Americans to vote.”\\n“The passage of H.R. 4 couldn’t come at a more critical time,”\\xa0continued Sewell.\\xa0“As states and localities erect deliberate barriers to the ballot box at an unprecedented pace, the need for federal oversight has never been more urgent. The Senate must now use every tool at its disposal to pass this bill and ensure it lands on President Biden’s desk. There is absolutely no time to waste.”\\nFor decades, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) prevented states and localities from restricting the right to vote. However, in its disastrous\\xa0Shelby County v. Holder\\xa0decision in 2013, the Supreme Court gutted the law, invalidating Section 4 and striking down the formula used to determine which jurisdictions are subject to federal oversight. In July 2021, the Court further weakened the law in its decision in\\xa0Brnovich v. DNC, making it more difficult to challenge discriminatory voting laws under Section 2.\\nSince 2013, there has been a steady increase in the number of restrictive voting laws that disproportionately suppress turnout among minorities, young adults, and the elderly. This accelerated in 2021 with the Big Lie of a “stolen election.” Just this year,\\xa018 states have enacted at least 30 laws\\xa0to restrict access to the vote.\\nNamed for the late Congressman and civil rights icon John Robert Lewis, H.R. 4 restores Section 4 of the VRA by establishing a modern-day formula that requires states and localities with a recent history of voter discrimination to seek approval from the U.S. Department of Justice before making changes to their voting laws.\\xa0\\nFor areas to qualify for judicial pre-clearance, they must have the following qualifications:\\n\\nStates with a history of 15 or more violations at any level in the previous 25 years\\nStates with a history of 10 or more violations, if one violation occurs at the state level in the previous 25 years\\nSubdivisions with 3 or more violations in the subdivision in the previous 25 years\\xa0\\n\\nH.R. 4 also restores Section 2 of the VRA by clarifying congressional intent and eliminating the heightened standard created by the Supreme Court in\\xa0Brnovich v. DNC\\xa0that makes it more difficult to challenge discriminatory voting laws.\\nThe John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act also:\\n\\nAllows federal courts to immediately halt questionable voting practices until a final ruling is made. This provision recognizes that when voting rights are at stake, prohibiting a discriminatory practice after the election has concluded is too late to truly protect voters' rights.\\nGives the Attorney General authority to request that federal observers be present anywhere in the country where discriminatory voting practices pose a serious threat.\\nIncreases transparency by requiring reasonable public notice for voting changes.\\nIncludes a retrogression standard for already-enacted but not-yet-implemented measures.\\nHelp plaintiffs to seek injunctive relief for voting rights violations in the lead-up to an election.\\xa0\\nEstablishes a grant program for small jurisdictions to help them comply with the bill’s various notice requirements.\\xa0\\n\\nH.R. 4 now heads to the Senate for consideration.\\nBill text can be found\\xa0here.\",\n",

Holder\\xa0decision and more recently in the 2021\\xa0Brnovich v. DNC\\xa0decision. The bill aims to protect voters from discrimination by restoring and strengthening the protections of the VRA. The introduction of H.R. 4 comes amid the most coordinated state-level effort to restrict the right to vote in generations and follows a months-long investigation by the House Committee on Administration and House Committee on the Judiciary into the status of voting rights in America. The bill enjoys support from over 190 original co-sponsors including all members of House Democratic leadership. The House is expected to vote on H.R. 4 next week.\\n“The right to vote is the most sacred and fundamental right we enjoy as American citizens and one that the Foot Soldiers fought, bled, and died for in my hometown of Selma, Alabama,”\\xa0said Rep. Sewell. “Today, old battles have become new again as we face the most pernicious assault on the right to vote in generations. It’s clear: federal oversight is urgently needed. With the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, we’re standing up and fighting back. By preventing states with a recent history of voter discrimination from restricting the right to vote, this bill restores the full promise of our democracy and advances the legacy of those brave Foot Soldiers like John Lewis who dedicated their lives for the sacred right to vote. I’m proud to be introducing this bill today and look forward to its swift passage. Our democracy is at stake.”\\nFor decades, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) ensured equal access to the ballot box for Black and minority voters by requiring states and localities with a history of voter discrimination—as determined in Section 4—to obtain pre-clearance from the Department of Justice before making changes to their voting laws. However, in its infamous 2013 decision in\\xa0Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority struck down Section 4, arguing that voter discrimination was an issue of the past and that the formula used to determine which states and localities were subject to preclearance was outdated.\\nOn July 1, 2021, in its decision in\\xa0Brnovich v. DNC, the Supreme Court struck another devastating blow to the VRA, upholding Arizona’s voting laws targeting Latino and other minority voters and making it more difficult for parties to challenge racially discriminatory voting laws under Section 2.\\xa0\\nBeginning in April, the House Committee on Administration Subcommittee on Elections held a series of investigatory\\xa0hearings\\xa0and collected numerous reports and documents regarding the status of voting rights in America. The hearings culminated in a\\xa0report\\xa0which the Committee released on Friday, August 6, detailing modern-day efforts to restrict the right to vote. Meanwhile, the House Committee on the Judiciary also held\\xa0hearings\\xa0on the need to protect the right to vote.\\nInformed by these findings, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would restore protections of the VRA gutted by the Supreme Court. It would once again prohibit states and localities with a recent history of voter discrimination from restricting the right to vote by including an updated formula for determining which states and localities are subject to federal oversight. It would also amend Section 2 of the VRA to eliminate the heightened standard for challenging voter discrimination that the Supreme Court created in its decision in\\xa0Brnovich v. DNC.\\nThe introduction of H.R. 4 comes amid the most coordinated state-level effort to restrict the right to vote in generations. Driven by the Big Lie,\\xa018 states have enacted at least 30 new restrictive, anti-voter laws\\xa0just this year.\\nA previous version of H.R. 4 passed in the House of Representatives during the 116th Congress by a vote of 228-187, but stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate. Last year, the bill was renamed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to honor the legacy of civil rights icon and former Congressman John Robert Lewis who passed away on July 17, 2020.\\n“The House today is taking a momentous step to secure the sacred right to vote for generations to come,”\\xa0said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\\xa0“With the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, proudly introduced today by Congresswoman Terri Sewell alongside Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, Democrats are fighting back against an anti-democratic tide, protecting access to the ballot box for every American and carrying on the cause to which our beloved John Lewis devoted his entire life.\\xa0 When the House returns on August 23rd, Democrats plan to pass H.R. 4 – and we hope it can secure the bipartisan support this vital legislation deserves.”\\n\\xa0“I am honored to join Rep. Terri Sewell and colleagues in introducing a long-standing priority for House Democrats and a vital tool for the long-term strength of our democracy: the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act,”\\xa0said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.\\xa0“Across the country, we continue to bear witness to GOP attacks on voting rights with restrictive laws and voter-ID rules to prevent people of color, students, and others from having their voices heard at the ballot box. H.R. 4 takes the necessary steps to respond to the flawed Supreme Court challenges to the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and ensures federal standards to stop these dangerous laws in their tracks. House Democrats will not falter in the fight for the right to vote, and we remain committed to ensuring our democracy can prosper and continue to deliver for the people.”\\n“Enabled by Supreme Court decisions weakening the\\xa01965\\xa0Voting Rights Act, state legislatures across the country are attempting to\\xa0make it more difficult to vote and easier to overturn election results. These undemocratic measures disproportionately impact communities of color,”\\xa0said\\xa0House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn.\\xa0“That is why I am proud to join with my colleagues Congresswoman Terri Sewell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to introduce the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. This critical bill will ensure that voting remains a fundamental right\\xa0of every American citizen and a touchstone of the greatest\\xa0democracy\\xa0the world have ever known. Nothing else will matter if we lose the right to vote. H.R. 4 will help prevent that from happening.”\\n“With dozens of states actively seeking to make it harder for millions of Americans to vote, there has never been a more important time to strengthen the Voting Rights Act of 1965, one of the most sacred texts of our nation’s civic religion,”\\xa0said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler.\\xa0“The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021 will not only restore critically important parts of the Voting Rights Act that were dangerously weakened by the Supreme Court, it modernizes the VRA to further protect our citizens’ right to vote from the cynical attacks of governors and state legislators. This legislation is the product of countless hours of hearings in the House Judiciary Committee as well as our colleagues on the House Committee on Administration that documented in exhaustive detail the myriad ways that the right to vote remains under threat for too many Americans. Congress now has the opportunity to make it harder for states seeking to limit voting rights and protect access to the ballot for all Americans. I thank Congresswoman Sewell and the dozens of other members who have worked tirelessly to make the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act a reality.”\\n“The right to vote is the most fundamental right in our democracy, and it must be protected,”\\xa0said ??Congressman Steve Cohen, Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.\\xa0“When jurisdictions enact laws that discriminate against minority voters, we know why. H.R. 4 would restore the power of the Voting Rights Act to ensure that every American -- regardless of race, color, or language-minority status -- can cast a meaningful ballot. This bill would update the pre-clearance coverage formula in Section 5, clarify the standards for Section 2, and strengthen the Voting Rights Act in numerous other ways. When more eligible citizens can participate in our elections, our democracy is more representative of and responsive to the people.”\\xa0\\n“Today’s introduction of H.R. 4 is an important step forward in fighting for voting rights for all Americans.\\xa0 The Supreme Court’s 2013 Shelby County decision took the heart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,”\\xa0said House Administration Committee Chairperson Zoe Lofgren.\\xa0“It opened the floodgates to new voter laws across many states that will make it harder to vote.\\xa0 My Subcommittee on Elections colleagues, led by Chairman G. K. Butterfield, recently released the report on their substantial hearings on voting in America.\\xa0 H.R. 4 is needed to restore the full strength and protections of the Voting Rights Act and, working alongside H.R. 1, the promise of our democracy.”\\n“H.R. 4 upholds the legacy of our dear friend Congressman John Lewis and continues his work and the work of generations of Americans like him who fought and sacrificed to ensure equal access to the ballot,”\\xa0said Congressman G. K. Butterfield, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Elections of the Committee on House Administration.\\xa0“On the recent 56th anniversary of the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Subcommittee on Elections of the Committee on House Administration released an evidence-based report detailing the ongoing and escalating wave of suppressive voting laws in many states across the country. The report made unequivocally clear that discrimination in voting has intensified since the Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby County and that voters of color face disproportionate barriers to vote in America. Today’s introduction of H.R. 4 honors our obligation to democracy – and to those who have been denied a voice in it – by seeking to restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act.”\\n“Access to the ballot box is under unprecedented threat, 56 years after enactment of the Voting Rights Act,”\\xa0said Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty. “Since last November, we have seen numerous statewide voter suppression laws spring up across America, threatening to silence the most vulnerable and underrepresented communities. As Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021. The right to vote is the very foundation of our democracy. Generations of brave, patriotic Americans have fought, marched, and shed blood to safeguard and expand that right. In introducing this legislation, House Democrats are honoring our promises ‘for the people’ to safeguard the right to vote for generations to come.”\\n“Every American should be able to exercise their fundamental right to vote, and it is critical that we protect this sacred right. It is alarming that multiple states have been ramping up efforts to pass restrictive laws that would undermine voting rights and actively create barriers that would keep many Americans, especially minority communities, from the voting booth,”\\xa0said Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairman Dr. Raul Ruiz.\\xa0“I’m proud to support the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021 (H.R. 4), which would prevent voter suppression, safeguard the integrity of our democratic process, and ensure all Americans have a voice in our democracy, regardless of where they live.”\\n“In the 2020 elections, Asian American and Pacific Islander voter turnout increased from less than 2.8 million in 2016 to around 4 million,”\\xa0said Chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Judy Chu.\\xa0“This surge in AAPI turnout was significant enough to be the margin of difference in a number of swing states, but it was only possible thanks to support for alternatives to in-person voting. In fact, in 2020, AAPI early and absentee voting increased by 300% in the 13 most contested presidential battleground states. That is why voter suppression laws meant to make it harder to vote are such a threat to AAPIs and all communities of color. At a time when census data prove that our communities are growing, voter suppression laws are increasingly being used to ensure we stay marginalized and silenced. And all of these attacks were made possible by the Supreme Court’s decision to gut Section 5 of the landmark Voting Rights Act. But with HR 4, we can ensure that our government has the tools needed to protect all voters from disenfranchisement. We know that the increase in restrictions on who can vote are directly related to an increase in voting from communities of color. But we will not allow another Jim Crow era. That is why we need to pass HR 4 immediately.”\\n“No matter our race, background, or zip code, we all value the freedom to vote and believe that all Americans should have a say in key decisions that impact our lives,”\\xa0said Wade Henderson, Interim President and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.\\xa0“Yet, with more than 400 state bills attempting to erect barriers to the ballot box for millions of Americans and a Supreme Court decision making it more difficult for voters to challenge discriminatory laws in the future, the promise of democracy is at risk. We absolutely must come together to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and restore the federal government’s ability to block state and local governments from passing racially discriminatory bills.”\\n“For decades the Voting Rights Act stood as a singularly effective bulwark against the threat of voting discrimination,”\\xa0said Wendy R. Weiser, Vice President, Democracy, Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law.\\xa0“At a moment when states across the country are passing laws that make it harder to vote — many of them targeted at voters of color — the need for a robust, revitalized VRA could not be starker. By restoring the law’s core protections, The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would safeguard the right of every citizen to participate in our democracy on an equal footing.”\\n“Since the Supreme Court’s 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision, we have seen a wave of changes to voting policies in states across the country that have had a discriminatory impact on Black voters and other voters of color,”\\xa0said\\xa0Lisa Cylar Barrett, Director of Policy NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.\\xa0“This year alone, we have seen the Court weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and 30 voter suppression bills enacted in 18 states, with hundreds more still under consideration. This crisis needs federal action. We commend the U.S. House of Representatives for introducing H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, as a first step in addressing the challenges voters face today. The preclearance provision in the bill essential to slow the spread of voter suppression legislation that denies access to the ballot box for racial, ethnic, or language minorities. We encourage members of the House to swiftly pass H.R. 4.”\\n“Through our collaborative, intersectional work with community partners around the Deep South, the SPLC has\\xa0witnessed first-hand\\xa0continued efforts to suppress the vote and undermine the democratic process particularly for communities of color since the Shelby County v. Holder decision in 2013,”\\xa0said Margaret Huang, President and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center and SPLC Action Fund.\\xa0“For generations after 1965, legislators of both parties and\\xa0Americans across all ideologies\\xa0have supported the Voting Rights Act because they understand that for our democracy to be healthy, every voter in the country must have safe, easy, and equitable access to their fundamental right to vote. Facing Supreme Court decisions that have significantly weakened the landmark law, and a proliferation of state anti-voter laws – primarily in the South – Congress must act to restore the Voting Rights Act to its full vigor and promise. With the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act in place, the federal government will again act as a barrier to prevent racially discriminatory voting changes before they can harm voters in jurisdictions with records of present discrimination in voting – like\\xa0Alabama,\\xa0Georgia,\\xa0Florida,\\xa0Louisiana, and\\xa0Mississippi\\xa0– and finally build a democracy that works for us all no matter where we live. Congress should utilize every legislative tool in its capacity to get this done; democracy is too important to be subject to a\\xa0minority veto.”\\nThe House is expected to vote on the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act next week.',\n",

Terri Sewell (AL-07) released the following statement on the 56th anniversary of the signing of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965:\\n“Fifty-six years ago today, the most consequential civil rights law of our time, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson. For Black and minority Americans across this nation, the signing of the Voting Rights Act represented the culmination of a decades-long struggle to protect the right to vote from those who have always sought to take it away. It was hard fought by the Foot Soldiers who risked their lives on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama earlier that year, and it meant the chance to finally exercise our most fundamental right as American citizens to have a say in the decisions that affect our lives.\\xa0\\n“As Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan wrote just weeks ago, ‘never has a statute done more to advance the nation’s highest ideals.’ Indeed, for decades the Voting Rights Act kept the promise of our democracy alive for all Americans, preventing states with a history of discrimination from targeting voters of certain backgrounds.\\xa0\\n“Yet today, the Voting Rights Act is in peril.\\n“Against the backdrop of the most coordinated state-level effort to restrict the right to vote in generations, the Supreme Court has dealt a series of disastrous blows to the Voting Rights Act, gutting key provisions and rendering it all but toothless in the face of relentless, modern-day Jim Crow attacks. The gutted provisions of the Voting Rights Act can no longer protect us from those extremists who have always sought to silence us. As President Biden said, we face the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War.\\xa0\\n“Old battles have become new again, and congressional action is once again required to safeguard the sacred right to vote for generations to come. Luckily, we have a solution. My bill, H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, would restore key provisions of the Voting Rights Act that were gutted by the Supreme Court. It would update the Voting Rights Act to combat modern-day efforts to restrict the right to vote and would once again establish federal oversight for states and jurisdictions with a recent history of voter discrimination.\\n“The need for federal legislation to protect the right to vote has never been so urgent. That’s why I have been hard at work drafting the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act with the House Judiciary Committee, the House Committee on Administration, and voting rights stakeholder groups. I will be introducing H.R. 4 in the coming weeks and once I do, Congress must use every tool at its disposal to pass it and ensure it is signed into law by President Biden.\\xa0\\n“Our democracy is at stake. Restoring the Voting Rights Act must be our top priority in Congress. Know that I will not rest until it is done.”',\n",

Not only did the Court uphold laws that were designed to disenfranchise minority voters, but it also made it more difficult to challenge such laws in the future, stripping minority voters of one of our last remaining avenues to fight back against discrimination.

Holder decision which gutted key protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act (VRA) and removed federal oversight from states with a proven track record of voter suppression:\\n“Today is a somber one, marking 8 years since one of the most disastrous Supreme Court decisions of our time: Shelby County v. Holder. On June 25, 2013, the Court gutted key protections of the Voting Rights Act, a landmark Civil Rights law that—for decades—prevented states from restricting the right to vote.

In an unprecedented assault on voting rights, 14 states have erected barriers to voting.\\xa0\\n“The future of our democracy is at stake, as extremist politicians enact Jim Crow 2.0 voter suppression legislation across the country,” said\\xa0Congresswoman Williams. “We might not be counting jelly beans in a jar, but these voter suppression laws sweeping the country are seeking the same results. I am confident that working with my fellow Congressional Voting Rights Caucus Co-Chairs, we will pass legislation to standardize our democracy. Your right to free and fair access to the ballot should not be dependent upon your zip code.”\\n“After the Supreme Court undermined the Voting Rights Act in 2013, we have seen many states enact voter suppression laws that would have previously been blocked,” said\\xa0Congressman Scott. “We need to pass federal legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act and protect the bedrock principle of our democracy: one person, one vote.”\\n“I’m so pleased to welcome Rep.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. -\\xa0Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass H.R. 51, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, landmark legislation that would admit Washington, D.C. as the 51st state of the Union. The bill would give D.C. residents voting representation in Congress and would allow for full, local self-government.\\n“Our Nation was founded on the idea that every citizen should have their voice heard and represented, but for too long, the residents of the District of Columbia have been denied a seat at the table,”\\xa0said Rep Sewell.\\xa0“Statehood for Washington, D.C. is an issue of civil rights, voting rights, equality, and basic fairness, which is why I was proud to join my colleagues in voting to pass the Washington, D.C. Admission Act. This legislation will strengthen our democracy and finally allow residents of the District to enjoy the full benefits of representative government.”\\nBackground on the\\xa0Washington, D.C. Admission Act:\\nIf enacted, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act would establish the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth, named after the famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass, as the 51st state of the Union. The state would consist of 66 of the 68 square miles of the present-day federal district. The remaining two square miles would comprise the federal district – the “Capital” – and would include the White House, Capitol, Supreme Court, principal federal monuments, and federal buildings adjacent to the National Mall.\\nWashington, D.C. residents are currently represented by Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton in the U.S. House of Representatives who can vote on procedural matters and in congressional committees but is not allowed to vote on legislation on the House Floor. Residents of the District currently have no representation in the U.S. Senate.\\xa0\\nThe State of Washington, D.C. would elect two senators and one representative to Congress. These members would have the same voting and representational rights as members from every other state in the Union.\\nWashington, D.C. statehood is an issue of fairness:\\n\\nD.C. residents have been petitioning for voting representation in Congress and local self-government for more than 200 years. Most recently, in November 2016, 86 percent of D.C. residents voted for statehood.\\nD.C. residents pay more federal taxes than 21 states and more per capita than any state; furthermore, the per capita personal income and gross domestic product is higher in D.C. than in any state.\\xa0\\nD.C.’s budget is larger than 12 states. Its bonds have the highest rating from Moody’s Investors Service – higher than 32 states. And it has a population larger than two states.\\xa0\\n\\nEvents of the past year demonstrate the need for D.C. statehood:\\n\\nIn the CARES Act, each state received a minimum of $1.25 billion in fiscal relief. D.C. was treated as a territory and received only $495 million.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe D.C. mayor was not able to deploy the D.C. National Guard to the Capitol during the January 6, 2021, insurrection, because the President controls the D.C. National Guard.\\nPresident Trump deployed thousands of federal law enforcement officers and National Guard troops in downtown D.C. against area residents engaging in constitutionally protected protests.',\n",

Both letters appear to encourage greater voting purges by states.\\n“We have little doubt that if complied with, these letters – issued unilaterally without any vote or public discussion – would lead to an unprecedented, nationwide voter suppression effort,” wrote CBC Chairman Cedric Richmond (D-La.), and Co-Chairs of the CBC Task Force on Civil and Voting Rights, John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.), and Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-Ala.).\\nDepartment of Justice Letter \\n“The letter from the DOJ appears to signal the initiation of a federal effort to prevent lawful voters from being able to vote, either by bullying states into removing such voters from their rolls, or by suing the states outright. We have previously seen such purging efforts conducted at the state level, littered with errors and inaccuracies, and inevitably performed in a manner which discriminates against minority voters.”\\nWhite House Voter Fraud Commission Letter\\n“We also have grave concerns that compliance with Mr. Kobach’s letter would result in unprecedented violations of American’s privacy rights and potentially violate federal law.\\xa0 The breadth of the information requested, including name, address, birth dates, political party affiliation, voting history, Social Security numbers, and military status, among other personal information is not only overwhelming, but chilling from a civil rights and liberties perspective.\\xa0 In addition to being used to conduct further discriminatory voter purges, one shudders to think of the many ways this information could be misused.”\\xa0\\nThe letters are online (Election Directors and Secretaries of State) and attached.',\n",

Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) releases the following statement:\\n“Donald Trump has done more to undermine the legitimacy of our democracy than any president in recent history,” said Rep. Sewell. “Today’s executive order uses a fake issue to cast doubt on the integrity of our elections all while laying the foundation for laws that disenfranchise our nation’s minority voters. If President Trump is truly interested in strengthening the security of our democracy, his first priority should be to ensure that our elections are protected from Russian interference. That is an issue founded on real evidence confirmed by 17 of our nation’s intelligence agencies. If this President wants to protect that sanctity of our vote, he should support an investigation into voter suppression tactics and work with Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act (VRA). But instead, President Trump has chosen to funnel our taxpayer dollars into a sham commission that confirms his worst biases.”\\nOn March 8, 2017, Reps.

The negative impact of the State of Alabama’s ill-conceived decision to eliminate and reduce DMV services proves that federal oversight is still necessary.\\xa0\\n“Unfortunately, Alabama has not yet fully learned the lessons of its painful past. It is still unlawful for state actions to result in a discriminatory effect on African Americans, irrespective of the intentions of such actions. When Alabama requires a photo ID to vote and then reduces access to the most popular form of identification because of budgetary reasons, that state decision is suspect, especially if the savings to the state are less than $100,000.\\xa0 This narrative reinforces old stereotypes about Alabama and harkens us back to our Jim Crow past when federal intervention was required to enforce constitutionally protected rights. It saddens me that this is still a reality in my home state today but I am glad the Obama Administration recognizes the need to investigate the discriminatory impact of state action such as the DMV closures.

Under Alabama’s voter ID law, only a handful of photo identification can be used at polling places, and the state-issued driver’s license is the most popular form of identification presented. To limit access to obtaining a driver’s license -- while insisting on a photo ID to vote -- is an unconscionable and overt barrier to voting.\\n\\xa0“Twenty-nine counties in Alabama will have no driver’s license offices, of which 15 of those counties are located in the rural parts of the Black Belt. This fact means many of my constituents who have limited modes of transportation will be denied an equal opportunity to obtain a means to vote. To restrict the ability of any Alabamian to vote is an assault on the rights of all Alabamians to equally participate in the electoral process.\\n\\xa0“When the State of Alabama started requiring a photo ID to vote in 2014, officials claimed it would reduce voter fraud. The reality is that voter fraud is rare, and the net result of the Alabama photo ID law has been to restrict equal access to ballot box for low-income, senior and disabled citizens.\\n\\xa0“The closure decision combined with the voter ID law is eerily reminiscent of past, discriminatory practices such as poll taxes and literacy tests that restricted the black vote. I seriously question the judgement behind the closing driver’s license offices in the most vulnerable communities. The State of Alabama should either rescind its requirement for voter IDs at the polling place or allow these offices to stay open. I am calling on Alabama lawmakers to reverse this ill-conceived decision and to rescind the voter ID law. As elected officials, we should be encouraging citizens to vote, not creating barriers that limit access to the ballot box. We should restore the vote, rather than restrict it.”\\n###',\n",

Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska became the first Republican to support the bill, and I am hopeful that other Republicans – in both the House and Senate – will join our efforts to restore federal voting protections.\\n“The Voting Rights Advancement Act reaffirms our commitment to voter equality and creating more pathways to voter access. The updated coverage ensures that states, like Alabama, are required to obtain preclearance for changes to voting practices and procedures and includes critical protections for Native Americans, naturalized citizens, and disabled voters.\\n“It is my hope that Congress rises to the challenge issued that the Supreme Court issued us. The Voting Rights Advancement Act contains a modern-day formula that requires states and localities with a recent history of racial discrimination in voting to seek approval from the U.S. Department of Justice before making any changes to their electoral laws.\\n“The landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 was born out of the struggle for voting equality, and addressed the need to expand federal voting protections so that no citizen is denied his or her constitutionally-guaranteed right to vote. The fate of our democracy rests with each and every citizen’s right to vote.”\\n###',\n",

This standard would apply to meat, meat food product, poultry, poultry food product, and processed food workers.“The federal government should not be in the business of rewarding companies with taxpayer-funded contracts if they aren’t adequately paying or protecting their workers,”\\xa0said Rep. Mark Pocan.\\xa0“Food processing is one of our country’s most dangerous industries and one that relies heavily on workers from marginalized communities. The time is long overdue to protect these vulnerable workers with federal guardrails.

Anything less will not be funded by the American people.”“Every single worker – no matter the industry or occupation – is entitled to just wages and safe working conditions,”\\xa0said Rep.

That way, the federal government is helping create an economy that works for all of us, not just a privileged few.

Instead, he and his Republican colleagues chose to engage in hostage-taking, refusing to raise the debt ceiling to avoid default unless paired with devastating cuts to essential government programs. While I am relieved the President and Democratic Leadership were able to walk back the worst of the Republicans’ demands, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I was unable to support this final agreement due to remaining unanswered questions.“This bill critically undercuts the appropriations process, one of the last processes in Washington where Democrats and Republicans work together. Severely restraining domestic spending while continuing to inflate unchecked defense spending for the Pentagon shows Republicans are not actually serious about addressing the deficit.\\xa0“With too many unanswered questions and unknown, undisclosed side deals, including a shortfall of $58 billion in promised domestic funding not explicitly guaranteed in the language of the bill for things like education, healthcare, and more, I could not, in good conscience, vote for this bill.\\xa0“In addition to my serious concerns about the impacts to the appropriations process and backroom deals, this bill expands SNAP work requirements for older Americans and threatens cash assistance for the lowest-income families, while simultaneously rescinding critical IRS investments intended to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. Moreover, this bill weakens key environmental and climate protections.\\xa0“While I am relieved that we will avoid an economic default, I remain steadfast that we never should have had to engage with an extreme MAGA Republican dominated caucus in hostage negotiations over Americans’ livelihoods to begin with. Looking forward, we should eliminate the unnecessary debt ceiling to avoid any question of the full faith and credit of the United States.”',\n",

       "  'date': 'May 22, 2019',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (May 22, 2019) – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) today reintroduced a bill to place an immediate moratorium on large acquisitions and mergers in the food and agriculture sector. The moratorium would be in place until Congress passes comprehensive legislation addressing the problem of market concentration in the agricultural sector. The companion bill was introduced in the Senate by U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Jon Tester (D-MT). It is supported by more than 200 farm, food, rural, and consumer advocacy organizations.The Food and Agribusiness Merger Moratorium and Antitrust Review Act was originally introduced by Pocan last September and called for an 18-month moratorium on large mergers and acquisitions; this year\\'s updated version calls for an indefinite halt. In addition to the indefinite moratorium, the bill would set up a commission to study how to strengthen antitrust oversight of the farm and food sectors and publish recommended improvements to merger enforcement and antitrust rules.\"Out-of-control consolidation has enabled big agricultural firms to control prices at every stage of the food chain, from farming to distribution, and Congress must do more to allow local farmers and food systems to be competitive, while establishing greater market transparency for the American consumer,\" saidPocan. \"Today, corporate profits are soaring, but many middle-class families, farmers, and food workers continue to struggle. Establishing a moratorium on ag-mergers will not only strengthen our antitrust laws, but it will also expand economic security and opportunity to more of our communities.\"\"Our agriculture and food sector have reached alarming levels of corporate concentration - today a small number of giant companies control every link of our food chain. For instance, four companies control as much as 90 percent of the global grain market, and the top four beef packers in the United States now control 85 percent of the beef market,\" Booker said. \"These excessive levels of concentration and market power are devastating our independent family farmers and ranchers and hollowing out the rural communities in which they live. Farmers and ranchers are being forced to sell into ever more concentrated marketplaces that unfairly reduce the prices they receive for their crops and livestock, and unfairly increase the cost of inputs. In 1950, a farmer would get 41 cents from every retail dollar for the products he sold; today that portion has plummeted to 15 cents. This must change. It\\'s time to restore competition to the marketplace, so that our farmers and ranchers can once again have the opportunity to share in the prosperity they help create.\"\"At a time when corporate profits are booming because of agribusiness mergers, farmers are facing record-low income due to this lack of competition. Congress must act to ensure a handful of corporations do not control our entire food supply. The wellbeing of farmers and consumers alike depends on us preventing the nation\\'s agricultural sector from becoming a full-blown monopoly,\" said Rep. Chellie Pingree (ME-01). \"As a farmer myself, I see the urgent need to rein in agribusiness consolidation and it\\'s why I\\'m proud to be an original cosponsor of the Food and Agribusiness Merger Moratorium and Antitrust Review Act of 2019.\"\"For too long, Washington D.C. has turned its back on its responsibility to ensure our economy works on behalf of the people and not corporate monopolies,\" Joe Maxwell, a fourth-generation hog farmer and the Executive Director of the Organization for Competitive Markets, said. \"It is only through fair and open competitive markets that our economy can deliver an equitable and inclusive prosperity for all individuals who through their work and investment build the prosperity that is America. Organization for Competitive Markets applauds Senators Booker and Tester for their courage, vision, and leadership in filing this imperative piece of legislation.\"The House bill is cosponsored by U.S. Representatives Earl Blumenauer (OR-03), Rosa DeLauro (CT-03), Ro Khanna (CA-17), Chellie Pingree (ME-01), Tim Ryan (OH-13), and Jan Schakowsky (IL-09).',\n",

From the roll back of U.S. Clean Air Act regulations to altered auto fuel efficiency standards and even possible changes to our financial regulations, bad trade deals negotiated in secret have consistently shown why it is important to get trade agreements done right, not fast. \"With the Trans-Pacific Partnership encompassing more than 40 percent of the world¹s economy we have to get it right and ensure we do not put the health and safety of the American people at risk. Congress should not grant fast track authority and rubber stamp the largest trade deal since NAFTA, when we don¹t know enough about the TPP and its potential consequences on our communities.\"The COOL policy was created when Congress enacted mandatory country-of-origin labeling for meat in the 2008 farm bill and was signed in to law by President George W.

       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI—Imagine if a gallon of milk suddenly cost $7 at every grocery store in south central Wisconsin. Unfortunately, that could become a reality starting in 2014 if Congress does not pass a new Farm Bill by the end of the year.  At a press conference today in Madison at the Jenifer Street Market, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) called for his colleagues not to leave Washington until action is taken to avoid these unnecessary price increases for families and farmers in south central Wisconsin.“Congressional inaction has already shut down the government, and now it is threatening to double the price of milk to more than $7 a gallon,” Pocan said. “This type of price increase would devastate our Wisconsin families and gravely harm our Wisconsin dairy farmers. Although the House is scheduled to finish its work by the end of the week, we will not have done our jobs if we fail to address this vital concern. I call on my colleagues not to leave Washington until we pass a Farm Bill and protect the economic security of our families and famers.”If Congress does not pass a new Farm Bill by the end of the year, the country will revert to the outdated dairy policies of the 1940s, which would effectively double the price of milk in the United States. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national average for a gallon of milk was nearly $3.50 in October.Members of the House and Senate on the Farm Bill Conference Committee are now working to finish a final agreement on new legislation, but with the House scheduled to leave Washington at the end of this week, time is quickly running out. Reports indicate that one of the major areas of disagreement remain over cuts to the food stamp program—the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP). House Republicans are advocating for $40 billion in SNAP Cuts, which would deny benefits to approximately 150,000 Wisconsinites, put 4,000 Wisconsin kids at risk of losing access to free/reduced school lunches, and result in the loss of an estimated $170 million to the Wisconsin economy just next year. Pocan voted against these cuts earlier this year.Monday’s press conference kicked off Pocan’s #MoreWork2Do Week, where he will highlight major priorities Congress should tackle before leaving on vacation. Due to a lack of leadership from House Republicans, this Congress is set to pass fewer laws this year than at almost any point in history. Among the priorities Pocan will highlight this week include the need to pass a budget, extend unemployment insurance benefits, pass comprehensive immigration reform, and focus on legislation to promote job creation and economic growth.###',\n",

Mark Pocan (WI-02) has co-sponsored the “Extend Not Cut SNAP Benefits Act” to extend the modest increase in benefits for one year.Due to these cuts, a family of four in Wisconsin could see a reduction of monthly benefits of up to $36, and the average benefit per person will drop to $1.40 for each meal.  “These cuts will make it even harder for more than 800,000 Wisconsinites to put food on the table and feed their families,” Pocan said. “While our economic growth remains tenuous, we cannot reduce support to our children, seniors and veterans who rely on these vital benefits.  These types of cuts, just like the $40 billion food stamp cuts proposed by my House Republican colleagues, make millions of Americans more hungry while hurting our economy and further slowing our recovery. I urge my colleagues to join our efforts to preserve food assistance funding for those who need it most.”SNAP funding is also a major issue of disagreement facing the Farm Bill Conference Committee that met for the first time this week. Pocan is vehemently opposed to the $40 billion in SNAP cuts proposed by House Republicans that would deny food assistance benefits for approximately 150,000 of Wisconsin’s poorest citizens. To raise awareness on the importance of these vital assistance programs, Pocan participated in the SNAP challenge this June, where he lived on a food stamp budget of $31.50 a week.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today will vote against Republican legislation that would deny food assistance benefits for approximately 150,000 of Wisconsin’s poorest citizens, including children, seniors and veterans. The legislation cuts nearly $40 billion from the food stamp program, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which offers a vital lifeline to Americans struggling to get back on their feet in this downturn economy.  Ninety-two percent of people on SNAP are children, the elderly, disabled, or already working.According to statistics from the Hunger Task Force, the bill would deny benefits to approximately 150,000 Wisconsinites, put 4,000 Wisconsin kids at risk of losing access to free/reduced meals, and result in the loss of an estimated $170 million to the Wisconsin economy just next year. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an analysis earlier this week reporting that the legislation would kick nearly four million people nationally off the food stamp program.“This extreme legislation forces more Wisconsinites into hunger while putting less money into our economy,” Pocan said. “The close to $40 billion worth of cuts would take food off the tables of 150,000 Wisconsinites struggling to support themselves and their families. If Republicans really want to shrink the food stamp program, they should focus on policies that will put people back to work, instead of bills that just leave more children, veterans and seniors hungry.”The bill contains a number of provisions that ignore the reality that many Wisconsinites continue to struggle with the state’s unemployment rate at 6.8 percent.  For example, the bill would end governors’ ability to waive SNAP’s harsh time limit for people looking for work in time of high unemployment, a waiver Wisconsin has requested the past ten years.  Earlier this week, Pocan sent a letter to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director Douglas Elmendorf asking the CBO to include the impact of these cuts on economic growth and jobs.  Estimates from the Center for American Progress indicate that these cuts would result in the loss of nearly 55,000 jobs just next year.To raise awareness on the importance of these vital assistance programs, Pocan participated in the SNAP challenge this June, where he lived on a food stamp budget of $4.50 a day ($31.50 a week) for seven days.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—As House Republicans prepare to introduce legislation this week to cut nearly $40 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and deny vital food support for four to six million low-income Americans, U.S. Rep. Pocan (D-WI) wants to ensure his colleagues understand the full implications of these drastic funding reductions on American families and the American economy. In a letter to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director Douglas Elmendorf, Pocan asks the CBO to include the impact of these cuts on economic growth and jobs in any analysis of the bill.  Estimates from the Center for American Progress indicate that these cuts would result in the loss of nearly 55,000 jobs just next year.SNAP provides an average of $4.50 of benefits per day to millions of Americans, including 800,000 Wisconsinites. According to Moody’s analytics, every $1 increase in SNAP benefits generates about $1.70 in economic activity“Cuts to food assistance programs not only take food off the tables of our poorest families, children, seniors and veterans, they also cut vital spending in our local economies,” Pocan said. “If House Republicans cannot be moved to vote against a bill that would leave millions in America hungry, perhaps facts on the destructive effects this legislation would have on local businesses and workers will impact their thinking.”Pocan was joined on the letter by Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD), Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), the ranking member on the Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, and Rep. James McGovern (D-MA), who has led the End Hunger Now campaign in Congress.To raise awareness on the importance of these vital assistance programs, Pocan participated in the SNAP challenge this June, where he lived on a food stamp budget of $4.50 a day ($31.50 a week) for seven days.Full text of the letter is below:September 16th, 2013The Honorable Douglas ElmendorfCongressional Budget OfficeFord House Office Building, 4th Floor \\tSecond and D Streets, SW \\tWashington, DC 20515-6925Dear Director Elmendorf,The House Majority is introducing a bill intended to serve as a substitute for the missing nutrition title of H.R. 2642, the Federal Agricultural Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013 (FARRM.). Media  reports state that the bill will include $40 billion worth of cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Assuming that this is the case, we have a number of concerns we would like you to address when analyzing the legislation.The Congressional Budget Office has released several economic analyses since the start of the economic downturn that have pointed out the relatively high multiplier effects of the SNAP program as a countercyclical economic stabilizer.  The necessary corollary is that reductions in SNAP benefits could have a greater impact in setting back our recovery than other policies that achieve equivalent levels of deficit reduction.  Given these potential consequences, we want to be sure that the full economic impact of the proposed cuts is taken into account when the bill is debated. Consequently, we ask that you include in any CBO analysis of this legislation an estimate of the changes in economic output and employment that can be expected to result from these SNAP cuts. In addition, we ask that you include in your analysis estimates of the impact of these cuts on beneficiaries, i.e. the extent to which individuals and families will see their benefits reduced and how many individuals would lose their benefits altogether.Having CBO-verified information on this subject would help Congress to fully understand the impact of this bill. Thank you for your attention to this request.

       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) is urging Speaker Jon Boehner not to leave more Americans hungry by cutting food assistance programs that benefit 800,000 Wisconsinites. In a letter with 204 other House Democrats, Pocan implored the Speaker to include funding for nutrition programs in any future Farm Bill that comes before the House of Representatives.“As a Congress, we should be doing all that we can to decrease hunger in America and tackle a crisis that affects millions of children and seniors each and every day. Unfortunately, thus far the Republican leadership has only moved on bills that would take food away from people who need it the most,” said Pocan. “A Farm Bill without funding for vital nutrition assistance programs is not a Farm Bill that is good for America. I urge Speaker Boehner and my colleagues across the aisle to come together with Democrats and do all that we can to ensure Americans don’t go to bed hungry.” In a dangerous break with tradition, this year’s Farm Bill pushed by the House Republican leadership did not include funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the food stamp program that benefits 47 million Americans. Recent reports indicate that Republicans are instead planning to introduce legislation that would slash SNAP funding by $40 billion, kicking millions of Americans off the program.“The Republican leadership recently forced through a Farm Bill reauthorization, H.R. 2642, which did not include the nutrition title, a major part of the Farm Bill that would reauthorize SNAP,” the members wrote. “We voted against this bill in large part because of this intentional omission. We strongly believe in the critical importance of SNAP. Given the essential nature of this program to millions of American families, the final language of the Farm Bill or any other legislation related to SNAP must be crafted to ensure that we do not increase hunger in America.”To raise awareness on the importance of these vital assistance programs, Pocan participated in the SNAP challenge this June, where he lived on a food stamp budget of $4.50 a day for one week.The full letter is as follows:August 13, 2013The Honorable John Boehner   The Speaker    H-232, The Capitol     Washington, DC  20515          Dear Speaker Boehner,The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is our country’s most critical anti-hunger program, helping more than 47 million Americans meet their basic food needs at a time when more than 50 million Americans face the threat of food insecurity.  Nearly half of SNAP enrollees are children, and the program helps feed roughly one in three children in America.  Additionally, almost 75 percent of SNAP participants are in households with children, seniors, or a disabled individual.More than half of the average household’s SNAP allocation is used within 7 days, and by the third week of the month 90 percent of SNAP benefits have been redeemed, leaving many families without the resources they need to buy food.  This inadequacy causes an added burden on food banks, as nearly 60 percent of the households receiving SNAP and using food banks have to rely on food banks at least 6 months a year.  In addition, under current law each household participating in SNAP will see a benefit reduction when the temporary increase from the Recovery Act expires.  This means that, beginning November 1st, each SNAP enrollee will see a cut to their benefit that is, on average, less than $1.50 per meal. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership recently forced through a Farm Bill reauthorization, H.R. 2642, which did not include the nutrition title, a major part of the Farm Bill that would reauthorize SNAP. We voted against this bill in large part because of this intentional omission. We strongly believe in the critical importance of SNAP.

Mark Pocan (WI-02) concluded the “SNAP Challenge” today, ending a week during which he lived off the food stamp budget of $4.50 of food per day to bring attention to the country’s hunger crisis and highlight Republican efforts to cut $20.5 billion from this critical food assistance program. On his final day of the challenge, Pocan voted on an amendment to the Farm Bill that would have restored the Republican cuts to the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which benefits more than 800,000 Wisconsinites. The amendment failed on a largely party-line vote.Every day in this country, SNAP prevents 47 million Americans from going hungry. The average nationwide weekly benefit for someone on SNAP is $31.50 a week, which breaks down to $4.50 per day and $1.50 per meal.  Approximately two-thirds of the benefits go to children, the elderly or the severely disabled. Yet if the proposed $20.5 billion in cuts to SNAP are implemented, two million Americans would be kicked out of the program, and  210,000 children in low-income families would lose access to free school meals.“For the past week, I have stood with the 800,000 Wisconsinites who use SNAP benefits to put food on their family’s table,” Pocan said. “While the challenge has been difficult, my experience is nothing compared to the daily struggles our hungry citizens face every day. For them, SNAP is a vital lifeline that helps feed their families and lift themselves out of severe poverty. The dangerous cuts proposed by my colleagues across the aisle will have deep, devastating consequences for the neediest Americans if they become law. I was proud to vote to reverse these cuts, and I will continue to fight to make sure no American is allowed to go hungry.”Pocan posted regular updates throughout the SNAP Challenge on his Facebook and Twitter pages.',\n",

       "  'date': 'July 25, 2023',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. —\\xa0Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, introduced the\\xa0Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act, legislation to improve training for food service employees in schools. The legislation would assist in the implementation of existing professional standards for these workers by ensuring that training occurs during work hours and at no cost, and if training is unable to occur during scheduled work hours, the bill makes clear that employees must be informed in advance and compensated appropriately. Representatives Mark Pocan (D, WI-02) and Elise Stefanik (R, NY-21) are introducing companion, bipartisan legislation in the House today. Senator Murray first introduced the legislation last Congress.“Food service workers do really essential work in our schools every day to make sure\\xa0kids can learn during the school day,”\\xa0said Senator Murray.\\xa0“Our legislation would make sure these workers get the best training available and that they aren’t being shortchanged for their time—common-sense fixes that will help our schools recruit and maintain a professional and skilled foodservice workforce.”“Nutritious meals are as important to a child’s development as learning to read,”\\xa0said Rep. Mark Pocan,\\xa0“and school food service workers play a vital role in guaranteeing every child gets the healthy food they deserve. The\\xa0Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act\\xa0will make it easier for workers to complete needed training and ensure food service workers have the skills to safely serve our kids. I’m proud to sponsor this critical bill with colleagues from across the aisle and in the Senate because good food and good jobs should be a part of 21st-century schools.”“When our students are hungry, they can’t learn. The dedicated food service professionals who prepare and serve school meals are committed to providing all students with the healthy meals that set the stage for learning and participation, and they need appropriate training for the expertise required,”\\xa0said Becky Pringle, President of the National Education Association.\\xa0“The\\xa0Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act\\xa0will help ensure that our food service professionals have access to training sessions during their paid work days or are compensated if the training has to occur outside of work hours to ensure our students are getting the healthy, nutritious meals they need to thrive.”The reauthorization of the\\xa0Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010\\xa0enacted professional standards for food service workers. These standards worked to ensure that school meals are as healthy as possible for students. The\\xa0Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act\\xa0builds on these standards and would:Ensure that training sessions occur primarily during regular, paid working hours;Compensate workers for training sessions that must occur outside of work hours;Make every effort to inform workers of training sessions that must take place outside of work hours;Ensure that school food service workers are not penalized if they are unable to attend training sessions outside of work hours; andPromote in-person, hands-on training whenever possible and appropriate.The text of the\\xa0Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act\\xa0is available\\xa0HERE.###',\n",

       "  'date': 'July 19, 2023',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.\\xa0– Today,\\xa0U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), and Andrew Garbarino (NY-02) and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Roger Marshall (R-KS)\\xa0introduced the “Helen Keller National Center Reauthorization Act,” bipartisan and bicameral legislation which would reauthorize Helen Keller National National Center for DeafBlind Youth and Adults (HKNC) for five years through 2028.HKNC provides essential vocational training and rehabilitation to the DeafBlind community across the United States. The Helen Keller National Center Reauthorization Act would allow for Congress to continue funding the Center from 2024 through 2028 by means of the Appropriations process.“The Helen Keller National Center has a long history of supporting DeafBlind people nationwide, providing them with opportunities to take an active role in their local communities,”\\xa0said Representative Pocan.\\xa0“For over 50 years, the Center has been an invaluable resource and solid foundation for DeafBlind Americans across the nation and in my home state of Wisconsin. I’m proud to join my colleagues and lead this effort to reauthorize the Center for five more years so this beneficial work can continue to shape the lives of so many.”“The Helen Keller National Center, headquartered on Long Island, provides essential rehabilitation and vocational training to members of the DeafBlind community across the country,”\\xa0said Representative Garbarino.\\xa0“With the help of the HKNC, DeafBlind Americans are able to receive the support, training, and resources to achieve their goals and thrive as productive members of society. I am proud to support the funding of the HKNC once again and I thank Congressman Pocan and Senator Gillibrand for their leadership on this issue.”“For over 50 years, the Helen Keller National Center has provided critical support services and resources to the DeafBlind community in New York and across the country,”\\xa0said Senator Gillibrand.\\xa0“I’m proud to work with my colleagues in this effort to reauthorize this vital center and ensure that members of the DeafBlind community continue to receive the support to fully participate in their communities.”\"I admire the important work that the Helen Keller National Center is doing to empower our deaf and blind community in Kansas and across the country. The HKNC does an excellent job providing crucial resources and services to help each member achieve their dreams,\"\\xa0Senator Marshall said.\\xa0\"Our bipartisan legislation reauthorizes these centers and provides much-needed certainty to the members of the HKNC.”Since it was first authorized by Congress in 1967, HKNC has established national services with regional offices based in California, Florida, Louisiana, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, New York, Arizona, and Washington. It has additionally created two Community Services programs in New York and California and has deployed 12 DeafBlind Employment Specialist positions across the country that provide additional assistance and support to DeafBlind persons in Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Michigan/Ohio, Massachusetts, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, Illinois, Indiana, and Arkansas. HKNC has also deployed three Youth services Coordinators in Utah, New York, and Illinois. HKNC’s goal is to deploy 20 DeafBlind Employment Specialists (two in each region) and to establish two additional Community Service Programs.\\xa0\\xa0HKNC is the only comprehensive national program that provides information, referral, support, and training exclusively to youths and adults who have combined vision and hearing loss. The Center also supports the families and professionals who work with the DeafBlind community.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02),\\xa0a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee,\\xa0released the following statement after he voted against the Bipartisan Budget Bill:“For months, I have been calling on Speaker McCarthy to put a clean debt ceiling bill on the floor to avoid bringing our nation to the brink of an unnecessary economic catastrophe, just as we did three times under President Trump and 78 times since 1960. Instead, he and his Republican colleagues chose to engage in hostage-taking, refusing to raise the debt ceiling to avoid default unless paired with devastating cuts to essential government programs. While I am relieved the President and Democratic Leadership were able to walk back the worst of the Republicans’ demands, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I was unable to support this final agreement due to remaining unanswered questions.“This bill critically undercuts the appropriations process, one of the last processes in Washington where Democrats and Republicans work together. Severely restraining domestic spending while continuing to inflate unchecked defense spending for the Pentagon shows Republicans are not actually serious about addressing the deficit.\\xa0“With too many unanswered questions and unknown, undisclosed side deals, including a shortfall of $58 billion in promised domestic funding not explicitly guaranteed in the language of the bill for things like education, healthcare, and more, I could not, in good conscience, vote for this bill.\\xa0“In addition to my serious concerns about the impacts to the appropriations process and backroom deals, this bill expands SNAP work requirements for older Americans and threatens cash assistance for the lowest-income families, while simultaneously rescinding critical IRS investments intended to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. Moreover, this bill weakens key environmental and climate protections.\\xa0“While I am relieved that we will avoid an economic default, I remain steadfast that we never should have had to engage with an extreme MAGA Republican dominated caucus in hostage negotiations over Americans’ livelihoods to begin with. Looking forward, we should eliminate the unnecessary debt ceiling to avoid any question of the full faith and credit of the United States.”',\n",

This year Public Schools Week is February 27 to March 3, and it serves as a time to celebrate the achievements of our public schools and honor the significant contributions and accomplishments of students, parents, educators, and education advocates.“As a public school graduate from kindergarten through college, I’m proud to recognize the 9 out of every 10 students in America that attend a public school,” Rep. Mark Pocan said. “I am committed to strengthening our public schools so that every child receives a high-quality education experience. Communities are stronger and schools are better when we all work together to support public education. Our shared future and our success depend on the support we give to public education today.”“America’s public schools have a long and storied tradition of preparing our children to become tomorrow’s leaders,” Rep. Sam Graves said. “Like the overwhelming majority of Americans, I’m a proud product of the public school system. I understand firsthand just how important public schools are to our communities and I’m committed to working to strengthen them so current and future generations have access to the same quality education that I did.”“It is an honor to co-lead the Public Schools Week Resolution,” Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici said. “Our system of public education is important for our children, families, community, and economy. As a policymaker and former public school parent, I am eternally grateful for the tireless dedication of our many teachers and school staff. I'm committed to making sure schools have the policies and resources they need to provide a quality education to all students.”“National Public Schools Week celebrates the storied history and success of our public school system and the education it provides to our youth,” Rep. Glenn “GT” Thompson said. “As a senior member of the Education and Workforce Committee, and an alumnus of public schools, I am well aware of the vital role schools play in their communities. Every child deserves access to a high-quality education so that they may learn and grow. We must continue to strengthen these institutions so we can better prepare our next generation of learners.”During Public Schools Week, national education groups representing teachers, principals, superintendents, parents, civil rights and disability advocates, and religious organizations highlight the importance of our public schools and the positive difference they make in shaping the future of our country. Public schools are open to every child – regardless of ability, wealth, country of origin, or needs, and by supporting public school systems we strengthen our country.Resolution Cosponsors Include (110): Reps.

       "  'date': 'June 16, 2021',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC—Today, Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Robert C. \"Bobby\" Scott (VA-03), chair of the House Education & Labor Committee, and Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) and Patty Murray (D-WA),\\u202fchair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, reintroduced the Pell Grant Preservation and Expansion Act, legislation that would double the Pell Grant award, index the award to inflation, and make other changes to expand the award for working students and families. The bill also makes the Pell Grant funding fully mandatory to protect it from funding shortfalls, expands the program to include DREAMers, and restores lifetime eligibility for the program to 18 semesters, among other changes that will benefit students.\"No one should be denied a chance at a higher education if they are smart enough and capable enough, but are unable to afford it. As a recipient of the Pell Grant myself, I know just how instrumental of a tool it is to make college accessible forall,\" \\u202fCongressman Pocan said.\\u202f\"Unfortunately, rising tuition costs and perpetual underfunding continues to undermine this critical program. The Pell Grant Preservation and Expansion Act would not only double the maximum Pell Grant, it would protect the program from future cuts, expand eligibility to include DREAMers, and ensure that postsecondary education is attainable for every student—regardless of their socioeconomic status.\"\"The Pell Grant is the most important tool we have to help students afford college. Unfortunately, due to the rising cost of college, the purchasing power of Pell Grants has severely eroded over time,\"\\u202f Chairman Scott of the House Committee on Education and Labor said.\\u202f\"By doubling the maximum Pell award, and adjusting future awards for inflation, the Pell Grant Preservation & Expansion Act will go a long way to restore the purchasing power and help millions of students earn a quality degree, without being forced to take on excessive debt.\"\"Every year, Pell Grants make college more affordable for millions of students in the United States—including tens of thousands of students in Hawaii. But over the last decade, the value of the Pell Grant has steadily declined—from covering nearly fourth-fifths of the cost of attendance at a public, four-year institution at its height, to less than one-third,\"\\u202f Senator Hirono said.\\u202f\"With the Pell Grant Preservation and Expansion Act, we have a real opportunity to restore the value of the Pell Grant for generations of students. I join my colleagues Senator Murray and Representatives Scott and Pocan in introducing this important legislation that will help more students pursue higher education.\"\\u202f\"It\\'s thanks to Pell grants that I was able to graduate and get a great education from Washington State University—but today\\'s students are being asked to pay more for college with less financial support. Students should never be forced to give up their higher education dreams because they can\\'t afford it—and this legislation will take a significant step in helping to make sure college is within reach for more students,\"\\u202f Senator Murray said.\\u202f\"I\\'m proud to introduce the Pell Grant Preservation and Expansion Act alongside my colleagues, and I\\'ll be working hard to get this across the finish line and ensure that every student—no matter how much money their family makes—has the opportunity to succeed.\"Representative Scott and former Representative Susan Davis (D-CA), along with Senators Hirono and Murray, introduced a similar version of this legislation during the 115th\\u202fCongress. Last year, several provisions from that bill were included in the year-end spending package, which restored Pell Grant eligibility for incarcerated individuals, students who have been defrauded, and students with drug-related offenses; raised the \"auto-zero\" threshold for the program; and increased the income protection allowance—improving the program for students.In addition to Representatives Pocan and Scott, and Senators Hirono and Murray, the Pell Grant Preservation and Expansion Act is cosponsored by Senators Jack Reed (D-RI), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Ed Markey (D-MA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), and Representatives Jake Auchincloss (D-MA), Joyce Beatty (D-OH), Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR), Brendan Boyle (D-PA), Cori Bush (D-MO), Andre Carson (D-IN), Tony Cardenas (D-CA), Joe Courtney (D-CT), Val Demings (D-FL), Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA), Mike Doyle (D-PA), Adriano Espaillat (D-NY), Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), John Garamendi (D-CA), Raul M.

       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI—Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement in response to the Wisconsin Republican Party\\'s refusal to fund K-12 and higher education at the level necessary to qualify for $1.5 billion in federal COVID aid.\"Once again, Wisconsin Republicans are selfishly screwing Wisconsinites out of $1.5 Billion in federal COVID relief,\" said Congressman Pocan. \"For the last year, the GOP-led state legislature has barely shown up to work, yet found time to threaten billions in federal food aid, COVID relief, healthcare assistance, and now relief for our students, schools, colleges, and universities. As a member of Congress, I work hard to ensure the people of Wisconsin receive the billions in federal aid that they deserve. At a certain point, the Wisconsin GOP must recognize that they have become the party of fiscal irresponsibility in the name of partisan pageantry. Wisconsinites elected these state legislators to help them—not to repeatedly stand in the way of relief, in the middle of an economic and healthcare crisis.\"In order to qualify for federal aid to Wisconsin schools—under the Consolidated Appropriations Act and the American Rescue Plan—states must maintain the same budget for K-12 and higher education in 2021-22 and 2022-23 as their average allocations in 2016-2019. In Wisconsin, the state legislature would need to add $387 million in funding for K-12 education and $41.2 million for higher education. However, the Republican-led Joint Finance Committee in the state legislature is falling short once again—adding only $128 million to K-12 education—risking $1.5 billion in federal COVID relief for Wisconsin. In response to possibly losing billions in education funding, the state GOP is trying to claim that a $350 billion fund that can be used for any purpose it wishes - even purposes not related to education - will \"fix\" the problem. Unfortunately, GOP budget tricks will not guarantee federal aid to Wisconsinites.',\n",

       "  'date': 'May 15, 2019',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (May 15, 2019) – Today, U.S. Reprsentative Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02), Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), and Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) re-introduced legislation aimed at reducing bullying and harassment, including cyberbullying, at colleges and universities around the country. The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2019 would require institutions of higher education to establish policies to prohibit harassment based on actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), disability, or religion. The bill also establishes a grant program to support campus anti-harassment activities and programs.The legislation is named after Tyler Clementi, a freshman at Rutgers University, who died by suicide after his roommate and another student invaded his privacy and harassed him over the internet. One in five college students are victims of cyberbullying, and LGBTQ students are nearly twice as likely to experience harassment as their peers.\"No student should be harassed or cyberbullied for who they are, or who they love,\" said Rep. Pocan. \"Bullying is a real and persistent danger for many LGBTQ students at our colleges and universities, but there is no federal legislation that specifically protects students from being targeted based on sexual orientation or gender identity. And more than two years into Donald Trump\\'s presidency, the Administration has worked to strip the rights of LGBTQ students as it rolled back regulations on equality at the Department of Education and directed the Department of Justice to file amicus briefs in support of discriminatory policies. With the White House\\'s refusal to act, we must take a strong stance to ensure that all students are protected. That\\'s why the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act is so important, as it ensures that institutions of higher learning are a place of open expression, which celebrate diversity and embrace students from all different backgrounds.\"\"No student should have to put their wellbeing, their safety, or their life in jeopardy just to access an education, but sadly we\\'re seeing students around the country take drastic measures because of bullying and harassment,\" said Senator Murray. \"In introducing this legislation, I\\'m calling on colleges and universities to step up and start taking responsibility for students\\' safety, and I\\'m so thankful for the support and partnership of advocates like Jane Clementi—who is fighting to ensure every student—no matter who they are, what they believe, or who they love—can pursue higher education free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying.\"\"No student should have to live in fear of being who they are. Our schools should not be, and cannot be, places of discrimination, harassment, bullying, intimidation or violence,\" said Senator Baldwin. \"This legislation, named in honor of Tyler Clementi, is an important step forward in not only preventing harassment on campus, but also making sure our students have the freedom to succeed in safe and healthy communities of learning and achievement. Everyone at colleges and universities across America should be able to pursue their dreams free of harassment and bullying.\"\"We are grateful to Congressman Pocan and Senator Murray for reintroducing the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act, and fully support this legislation. We believe all institutions of higher education should have policies to keep all their students safe. Because every student deserves a positive educational experience in a safe environment free of harassment, bullying or humiliation, where they can learn, study and thrive regardless of their race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or whatever else makes them special and precious; and every parent should have peace of mind that their children will be protected and free of harm while in the school\\'s care,\" said Jane Clementi, CEO and Founder of the Tyler Clementi Foundation and Tyler\\'s mother.\"No student should be subject to harassment or discrimination because of who they are or who they love,\" said David Stacy, HRC Director of Government Affairs. \"The past two years have seen a rollback of protections for LGBTQ students by the Trump-Pence-DeVos administration. The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act is a significant step forward in curbing anti-LGBTQ harassment and fostering environments that are affirming and encouraging for LGBTQ students. We thank Senators Patty Murray and Tammy Baldwin and Congressman Mark Pocan for their leadership.\"\"Harassment is rampant on college campuses and undermines students\\' ability to thrive in a safe environment,\" said Fatima Goss Graves, President and CEO of the National Women\\'s Law Center (NWLC). \"This bill is a critical step forward in combatting this scourge. It strengthens protections against harassment and would support much needed prevention and training programs. Every student in America deserves the right to learn without fear. This bill helps make that promise a reality.\"In addition to Senators Murray and Baldwin, the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act is also cosponsored by Senators Blumenthal (D-CT), Booker (D-NJ), Cardin (D-MD), Casey (D-PA), Duckworth (IL), Feinstein (D-CA), Gillibrand (D-NY), Harris (D-CA), Hassan (D-NH), Hirono (D-HI), Klobuchar (D-MN), Markey (D-MA), Menendez (D-NJ), Merkley (D-OR), Rosen (D-NV), Sanders (D-VT), Schatz (D-HI), Shaheen (D-NH), Smith (D-MN), Van Hollen (D-MD), Warren (D-MA), Whitehouse (D-RI), and Wyden (D-OR).In addition to Congressman Pocan, the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act is also cosponsored by Representatives Bonamici, Brownley, Carbajal, Cárdenas, Cicilline, Cohen, Craig, Crist, DelBene, Susan Davis, Deutch, Engel, Eshoo, Garamendi, Grijalva, Hayes, Jackson Lee, Jayapal, Kilmer, Larsen, Lieu, Lowenthal, Carolyn Maloney, Sean Patrick Maloney, McCollum, Meng, Moore, Morelle, Moulton, Nadler, Norton, Pallone, Panetta, Peters, Pappas, Rice, Roybal-Allard, Ryan, Scanlon, Schakowsky, Schiff, Soto, Swalwell, Mike Thompson, Titus, Wasserman Schultz, and Watson Coleman.The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act has been endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), Tyler Clementi Foundation, National Women\\'s Law Center (NWLC), National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, American Association of University Women (AAUW), GLSEN, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.To read the fact sheet of the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act, click here.',\n",

The Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act would ensure that training occurs during work hours, and if training is unable to occur during scheduled work hours, the bill makes clear that employees must be informed in advance and compensated appropriately.\"Every day, our nation\\'s school food service workers ensure that millions of American children receive the nutrition they need. While training has become an essential part of the role, many food service workers have become burdened by the cost and scheduling, making it difficult for them to meet the requirements,\" said Congressman Pocan. \"Employees shouldn\\'t be forced to stay late for training or be penalized if they can\\'t attend it outside of their scheduled hours. The Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act eases the effects that completing this training can have on workers. I\\'m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation and am grateful for my colleagues support of this critical bill.\"\"It is essential our children have access to nutritious school lunches, and cafeteria food service workers are key to delivering these meals,\" said Congressman Katko. \"This legislation sets forth basic provisions to ensure that the individuals who work to make healthy meals in our schools are trained professionally and properly.\"\"Food service workers make sure our kids receive nutritious meals at school. They are an essential part of our children\\'s education and we should treat them as such,\" Congressman Levin said. \"Food service workers deserve high quality, on-the-job training without having to pay out-of-pocket. That\\'s why the bipartisan Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act is so important, and I\\'m proud to support it.\"\"Food Service workers play a significant role in our children\\'s schools, and we should make every effort to ensure they are treated fairly as respected and valued employees,\" said Congresswoman Stefanik. \"These employees should not have to pay out of pocket with their time or money in order to receive training to effectively do their jobs. This bipartisan legislation ensures that Food Service workers receive training within work hours or are properly compensated for trainings outside of work hours. I\\'m proud to support this important bill and to stand with school employees throughout the North Country.\"The reauthorization of the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010 enacted professional standards for food service workers. These standards worked to ensure that school meals are as healthy as possible for students. The Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act builds on these standards and:Ensures that training sessions occur primarily during work hours;Compensates workers for training sessions that must occur outside of work hours;Makes every effort to inform workers of training sessions that must take place outside of work hours;Does not penalize workers who are unable to attend training sessions outside of work hours; andPromotes hands-on, in-person training when appropriate, and utilizes online training as supplemental when appropriate.###',\n",

       "  'date': 'April 10, 2019',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (April 10, 2019) – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) today led more than twenty Member of Congress in reintroducing the Student Loan Refinancing Act (H.R.2186), bipartisan legislation which would remove the current restrictions on refinancing and allow anyone with a subsidized or unsubsidized federal Stafford loan, or a federal direct PLUS loan, to refinance the student loans whenever borrowing rates are reduced.\"Americans now hold more than $1.5 trillion in student loan debt, a staggering amount of debt that restricts Americans\\' ability to contribute to the economy and make other major purchases, like buying a home or a new car,\" said Pocan. \"We must take steps to help reduce the crushing burden of student debt and allow millions of Americans to refinance their student loans, just like any other borrowers. Students deserve a fair shot at the middle class, not a multi-decade debt sentence. I\\'m proud to reintroduce the Student Loan Refinancing Act and I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation to bring down the long-term cost of a college degree.\"With student loan debt surpassing $1.5 trillion, the Student Loan Refinancing Act would help reduce debt on the nearly $1.4 trillion of federally owned student loans, allowing millions of graduates and borrowers currently repaying their federal student loans to refinance at a lower interest rate whenever a lower rate becomes available.Currently, interest rates are at historic lows and homeowners, corporations, and state and local governments are refinancing to reduce debts. Refinancing allows the borrower to replace existing debt with a new loan with a lower interest rate, meaning borrowers will reduce the value of their debt, freeing up income for purchases and creating ripple effects throughout the entire economy.However, student loan borrowers are being left out of this trend, and it is having a dramatic effect on the economy: 40% of graduates with college loans delayed making a major purchase such as a car because of college debt; 25% put off continuing their education or moved in with relatives to save money, according to a Rutgers University study. By the end of 2012, there has been an almost 50% drop of 25- to 30-year old Americans with student debt who were granted a mortgage as compared to 2009.The Student Loan Refinancing Act is cosponsored by U.S. Representatives Glenn Grothman (WI-06), Don Beyer (VA-08), Brendan Boyle (PA-02), Julia Brownley (CA-26), Steve Cohen (TN-09), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Ro Khanna (CA-17), Barbara Lee (CA-13), Dave Loebsack (IA-02), Alan Lowenthal (CA-47), Tom Malinowski (NJ-07), Grace Meng (NY-06), Gwen S.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (March 28, 2019) – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement regarding President Trump stating that he has reversed course on the decision to eliminate funding for Special Olympics in the Department of Education\\'s FY 2020 budget request.\"I\\'m extremely glad that the American people have convinced President Trump to do the right thing with Special Olympics. However, it shouldn\\'t take public outcry and shaming to restore funding to one of our nation\\'s most important special education programs.\"For the last three years, President Trump and Secretary DeVos have eliminated Special Olympics funding in the Department of Education\\'s budget request. This was not a one-off mistake where President Trump is making a correction or having a change in heart. Rather, President Trump and Secretary DeVos could not take one more day of a bad news cycle and the public shaming on their cruel and outrageous cut to Special Olympics. Congress was already planning to ignore the Administration\\'s disgraceful budget request, so this is only an attempt to save face. Further, the President doesn\\'t have the authority to authorize spending.\"President Trump\\'s budget is filled with misguided and dangerous cuts that will cause serious and lasting pain to the most vulnerable Americans. I\\'m hopeful that now President Trump has reversed course on Special Olympics, we can have a conversation regarding Social Security, Medicaid, the National Institutes of Health, and so much more.\"And by the way, can someone pull Betsy from under the bus?\"',\n",

With public school enrollment reaching more than 50 million students, we must invest in our public schools and ensure that we have a public education system that is preparing our students for the challenges that lie ahead,\" said Pocan. \"Democrats and Republicans are coming together to celebrate Public Schools Week because we are especially proud of the public schools in our communities, the millions of students in our districts, the dedication of teachers, and the hard work of school administrators and support staff. Together, we can give our students and our educators in public schools the resources they need to thrive.\"\"Our public schools have always been and will continue to be a critical asset to North Missouri and the country. The schools throughout my district do incredible work to educate our children. Our teachers and faculty are devoted to making sure they receive a quality education. This is evidenced by the outstanding graduates of our public schools who go on to make a difference here at home and around the world. Public Schools Week is a great opportunity to celebrate the successes of our students, teachers, faculty and administrators across the country,\" said Graves.\"Our communities are stronger when everyone has access to a quality public education,\" said Bonamici. \"As a proud public school graduate and parent of public school graduates, it is my honor to be a sponsor of the bipartisan Public Schools Week. Public education is one of the best investments we can make. I am grateful to all of the teachers, administrators, counselors, and support staff who help students thrive. I will continue to advocate for public education and for the resources our schools need.\"\"During National Public Schools Week, we acknowledge the diversity and success of our public schools and the sound education they provide,\" Thompson said. \"As a senior member of the Education & Labor Committee and a product of public schools, I know the incredible role our schools play in communities across the nation. A child\\'s opportunity should not be left to chance, and every child deserves a quality, well-equipped school where they can learn, be inspired, and thrive. Public schools do that. We must continue to strengthen our public schools, where our most precious resource is developed: our children.\"',\n",

       "  'date': 'March 6, 2019',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (March 6, 2019) – Today, U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) and U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) led a group of 42 members of Congress in reintroducing the Debt-Free College Act, legislation that will reverse the growing student debt crisis in the United States. The bill restores a path to affordable college by providing states incentives through matching grants to increase investments in public higher education and provide students with debt-free college.If signed into law, the Debt-Free College Act would establish a state-federal partnership that provides a dollar-for-dollar federal match to state higher education appropriations in exchange for a commitment to help students pay for the full cost of attendance without having to take on debt.\"The full cost of college – including books, room and board, and supplies -- is more than twice as much as tuition. If we are going to be serious about solving the student loan debt crisis we need to focus on the real cost to students and their families,\" said Senator Schatz. \"My bill brings states back to the table and leverages federal dollars to reinvest in public education, and help people cover the full cost of college.\"\"Higher education is one of the most certain paths to economic security and opportunity for Americans. However, while college-degree holders earn significantly more than workers with only high school degrees, the cost of higher education – including tuition, living expenses, books, housing, meals, and more – is now out of reach for many students and their families,\" said Congressman Pocan. \"The Debt-Free College Act creates a critical federal-state partnership that would make debt-free college a reality for students within five years. With the federal government, states, colleges and universities, and students and their families all contributing, we can ensure that students graduate debt free and are not at a competitive disadvantage as a result of being burdened with student loan debt.\"Beyond tuition and fees, the total cost of attendance—room and board, books and supplies, and other expenses—has forced 44 million Americans to take on debt to cover their financial need. College debt has increased 170 percent since 2006 and now exceeds $1.5 trillion dollars, which is second only to mortgage debt and surpasses even credit card debt.According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, student loan debt is responsible for 35 percent of the decline in homeownership since 2007. The percentage of younger people who reported owning a business was cut in half between 2010 and 2013. Pew Research Center found that about 50 percent of student borrowers say their loans increase their risk of defaulting on other bills.\"For far too many Americans, a college degree is out of reach because of the incredible cost – and for too many others, the debt incurred on the path to higher education makes long-term financial stability all but impossible,\" said Congresswoman Lee. \"This is especially true for African American students and students of color, who are less likely to be able to afford college than their white peers and more likely to default on their loans after graduating. I\\'m proud to co-sponsor this legislation to make college more affordable for all Americans and to address the current crisis in student loan debt.\"\"American students deserve a real shot at achieving their dreams, not a ‘debt sentence\\' if they choose to go to college. Unfortunately, too many students have had those dreams dashed by mountains of student debt and by rogue loan servicers hounding them into bankruptcy, which is why 11 of our members have brought a class action suit against Navient. They\\'re shouldering $1.7 trillion of debt, often paying hundreds of dollars a month, partly because 41 states still spend less on higher education than they did before the recession. This pathbreaking bill will help stoke new investment instead of creating more austerity, which will help students graduate debt-free. We hope that Congress, state governments and higher education institutions will work together to turn this bill into urgently needed law,\" said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers.The bill is co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).In the House, the bill is cosponsored by U.S. Representatives Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Brendan Boyle (PA-02), Judy Chu (CA-27), Madeleine Dean (PA-04), Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11), Chuy García (IL-04), Jimmy Gomez (CA-34), Vicente Gonzalez (TX-15), Raúl Grijalva (AZ-03), Deb Haaland (NM-01), Katie Hill (CA-25), Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC-AL), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Ro Khanna (CA-17), Barbara Lee (CA-13), Carolyn Maloney (NY-12), Gwen S.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (November 30, 2017) – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) today announced the findings of a new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report regarding taxpayer funded school voucher programs and how they are failing to provide students with equitable opportunity. As part of the report Pocan requested, the GAO studied 27 taxpayer funded private school voucher and education savings account programs in the 2016-2017 school year.\"The new report from GAO shows the outrageously low standards to which many school voucher programs are held. As Secretary DeVos continues her assault on public education and efforts to privatize schools, it is more important than ever to ensure that these programs are held accountable,\" said Rep. Pocan. \"Every student deserves the opportunity to go to a school that meets their needs and every parent should have the guarantee that their child is in a safe, equitable, and successful environment. The U.S. Department of Education must address the concerns in this report and should immediately institute the GAO\\'s recommendations. Our students deserve nothing less.\"\"Betsy DeVos has made expanding private school vouchers and voucher-like schemes the centerpiece of her agenda, including pushing for these schemes at the federal level. This GAO report highlights how vouchers hurt, not help, students with disabilities,\" said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers. \"The federal government should be working to support students with disabilities, not undermining their federal rights and protections.\"\"Congress should amend IDEA immediately to ensure that parents of children with disabilities know the important rights and services they are leaving behind when they take a private school voucher,\" said Daniel Domenech, Executive Director of the American Association of School Administrators. \"These scathing findings detailing the lack of transparency and accountability in state voucher programs by a nonpartisan government office should concern all taxpayers, but particularly families with children in public school who see their dollars ripped out of the public school system to support these deeply flawed programs.\"Of the 27 programs studied by the GAO, only 8 of the programs required private schools to comply with annual financial audits, meaning that the states funding the schools often had no clear understanding of the programs the investments are funding. The GAO also found that many of the programs lack accountability and transparency when it comes to disability protections, education standards, professional standards, and information distributed to parents.Findings from the GAO report include:Only about half of the private schools participating in voucher programs provided special education or disability related information on their websites, creating a significant problem for families making a decision about where to send their children.Private school voucher programs are inconsistently providing information on changes in key protections and rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) when parents move a child with a disability from a public to a private school.83% of students who were enrolled in a program specifically designed for students with disabilities were enrolled in one that either provided no information or inaccurate information regarding the changes in IDEA rights.One third of the 27 programs operating in school year 2016-17 had no academic testing requirements and officials in two of the programs interviewed indicated that some private schools were unfamiliar or unequipped to administer standardized tests.Only one third of the programs require schools to publicly report test results.Only four programs provided information on the graduation rates at participating schools.Only an estimated 13% of all private schools participating in voucher programs provide student and school performance data on their websites.Just seventeen of the programs required background checks on all employees or on employees with direct and unsupervised contact with children.The full report is available here.###',\n",

With the Perkins Loan program scheduled to expire on September 30, 2017, Congress must reauthorize the program, or 500,000 students across the country will not be able to access much-needed financial aid.\"With more than half of the U.S. House of Representatives supporting the Perkins Loans Extension Act, we should immediately bring the bill to the floor for a vote. Hundreds of thousands of students across the country are counting on Congress to act by September 30 to reauthorize this program or their futures will be in jeopardy,\" said Pocan. \"These students attend colleges and universities across the country and the Perkins Loans program gives them the opportunity to access an education they would otherwise be unable to afford. No American should ever be denied the opportunity to achieve their dreams, especially when they have worked hard and are the first in their family to attend college, as many Perkins Loans recipients are.\"\"I want to thank my colleagues for lending their voice and their support to this important effort,\" said Stefanik. \"A half million students across the country will lose access to critical financial aid without action by Congress, so I\\'m pleased that a majority of my House colleagues have joined in support of H.R. 2482 – the Perkins Loan Extension Act. When I speak to students and families across my district, college affordability continues to be a major challenge. The Perkins Loan program is a critical tool to support low and middle income students, and I urge the House to swiftly pass this commonsense, bipartisan legislation to help students across the country achieve their dreams.\"Pocan and Stefanik led the introduction of H.R. 2482, the Perkins Loan Extension Act, which extends the Perkins Loan Program for a period of 2 years so that students currently enrolled in the program can continue to receive financial aid. The legislation currently has 223 cosponsors in the House of Representatives and is supported by more than 30 education based organizations and more than 80 universities.

When you hear us talk about better jobs, better wages, and a better future, let me try to put it another way coming from America's heartland, from Wisconsin.It's really what people talk about at their kitchen tables—can they afford their mortgage or rent, can they have health care for their family, can they take a family vacation, can they send their kids to college if they want to go. That's what people actually talk about.Just contrast that with what we're doing right now in Congress. We've spent the first eight months trying to take away health care from 20 million people, we want to now cut taxes for the wealthiest in this country, and some people are willing to shut down government over a wall.Well, I can tell you in Paul Ryan's district, which is the neighboring district to mine, if the wall means you're keeping employers in, they might support that, but 25,000 people used to make cars in the 1st Congressional District, in Paul Ryan's district—no one does today.The subcommittee that I'm on, along with Ami Bera, Marc Veasey, and Lisa Blunt Rochester, is to talk specifically about access to jobs, what we can do to help do that—that covers everything from higher education, apprenticeships, access to capital, entrepreneurship.Those are the goals that we have with this committee, and we are up to the task and look forward to making sure that our caucus continues to focus on what's most important to people across the country, and that's talking about jobs and wages, something the Republicans simply aren't doing.And it is my honor to introduce, I believe the word is spectacular I am supposed to use, Representative from Pennsylvania, Brendan Boyle.\",\n",

I'm here to represent the Progressive Caucus—Raúl Grijalva and I are co-chairs—that caucus is the largest values based caucus within our (Democratic) caucus, mid 70s in members.We have always said that the core economic issues are at the center of everything that we need to talk about, what people talk about at their kitchen table—whether or not they can afford their mortgage, have health insurance for their family, send their kids to college if they want to, or take a family vacation.Those are the core issues, and if we are going to talk to people about anything else that we care about—and there are many things we care about—we have to be centered around better jobs, better wages, and better a future.So we are glad to share these values with all the different caucuses within the Democratic Caucus. We are all on the same page, and if you look at the Republican Party, not only are they not on the same page, but they're not reading out of the same book, and whatever books they're reading from aren't even in the same language.So, we are glad to all be here, united around this core economic message that's so very important, and the Progressive Caucus is glad to work with everyone else in advancing these principles as we move forward. And it's my pleasure to introduce someone from my class, who is representing the New Dems, Scott Peters from San Diego, California.Here is Rep. Pocan's response to a question on apprenticeships:If I can just add real quick, I've been a small-business owner for nearly three decades, and one of the issues that we had up in Appropriations, which I serve on, last week is they also gutted every single dime of money for apprenticeship grants.One of our focuses is on apprenticeships, and we had the previous question, I think last week or two weeks ago, on a bill that I have called the LEARNS Act, where we are trying to expand apprenticeships and go beyond a traditional just building trades model into healthcare and IT and a lot of other areas.So apprenticeships are a way to give people the training and the skills that they need to get the jobs that are out there, and we are very focused on it. In contrast, Republicans are literally gutting every single dime, not just President Trump's budget, but the Congressional Republicans as well.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-NY-21), Mark Pocan (D-WI-02) Louise Slaughter (D-NY-25), John Duncan (R-TN-02), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL-27) and Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA-11) introduced the Perkins Loan Extension Act of 2017 – bipartisan legislation to extend the Perkins Loan Program for a period of two years. The Federal Perkins Loan is a popular and effective campus-based financial aid program, which supports access to higher education by providing low interest loans to students in need.\"The Perkins Loan program helps students struggling to find a way to pay for college in Wisconsin and all across the country,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"Providing a two year extension of the program is a commonsense step towards ensuring access to this vital tool for making college more affordable. Without Perkins, many students and families would be left with few options to cover college expenses. Two years ago we passed a bipartisan extension of Perkins and I will continue to work tirelessly with my colleagues to make sure it happens again this year.\" \"Perkins Loans are an important resource for low income families in my district who are pursuing their higher education dreams,\" said Congresswoman Stefanik. \"As the first Member of my immediate family to graduate from college, I know how critical a college degree is to succeeding in a 21st century economy. We must ensure that low income students have access to a quality education, and the Perkins Loan program is a critical tool to help them succeed. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.\" \"A number of students in my District rely on the Perkins Loan Program, so we need to extend the program for another two years,\" said Rep. John Duncan. \"I believe the entire federal student loan system needs to be revamped and made more efficient, cost-effective, and helpful for our students.  But in the meantime, we need to extend the Perkins Loan program for these students while Congress determines how best to improve federal student loans.\"\"Perkins loans help low-income students access the benefits of a higher education,\" said Rep. Louise Slaughter. \"This program provides low-interest loans that are paid back to the student\\'s college, creating a revolving system that supports the next class of deserving students. With no additional funding from the federal government, Perkins loans will continue to help low-income students attain an education and allow them to break the cycle of poverty. It is inexcusable that some politicians are targeting this program for elimination since without Perkins, 500,000 low-income students across the country—nearly 50,000 from New York State and over 6,000 from my district alone—would not have access to a critical safety net.\"\"The state of California is the second highest recipient of Perkins loans, which help students focus on their studies rather than how they will afford college. By improving affordability of higher education today, we are strengthening the workforce of tomorrow.  I am proud to join colleagues from both sides of the aisle to introduce the Perkins Loan Extension Act to help students continue to receive the assistance they need and deserve,\" said Congressman Mark DeSaulnier.\"As a former Florida certified teacher, I\\'ve been committed to helping students and prospective students achieve their educational goals,\" said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. \"For years, Perkins Loans have empowered many students in South Florida to realize their dream of a college education, and equipped them with the knowledge and tools to have successful professional lives. It is an honor to join with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this effort to ensure that these loans remain available to low income students.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure the speedy extension of these important loans.\"Absent Congressional action, the Perkins Loan program will expire at the end of September leaving around 500,000 students without access to important financial aid.Perkins Loans borrowers are predominantly from lower income families and are often the first in their family to attend college. Unlike many other student loan programs, Perkins is administered directly by colleges and universities who originate the loans, counsel their students through repayment, and select contractors for servicing and collection.Colleges and Universities tailor the program to best fit borrowers\\' and institutions\\' situations. Perkins is a risk-sharing program with institutions contributing one-third of their students\\' awards. This \"ownership interest\" also contributes to the successful management of this vital program.-67% of Perkins borrowers are dependent students, 34% of whom are from families with household incomes of less than $30,000.-20% of Perkins borrowers are independent students, 70% of whom have personal incomes of less than $20,000.The Perkins Loan program is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2017 if Congress does not act to reauthorize this program. If the Perkins Loan is eliminated, around 500,000 students across the country will not be able to access much-needed financial aid.

Each year, more than 500,000 students nationwide rely on low-cost Perkins loans to help finance their education. The Coalition of Higher Education Assistance Organizations (COHEAO) is proud to support these champions in their efforts to extend this long-standing and proven program and we encourage Congress to pass this legislation immediately so that critical funding decisions can be made for these students now.\" Maria Livolsi, COHEAO President\"The State University of New York proudly supports the Perkins Loan Extension Act, which would ensure continued financial aid for more than 14,000 of our own students and hundreds of thousands more across the country,\" said SUNY Chancellor Nancy L.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today introduced the bipartisan Student Loan Refinancing Act, which would allow borrowers to refinance their federal student loans any time a lower interest rate is available.\"With college debt skyrocketing, Congress should be doing everything it can to help reduce the crushing burden of student debt,\" said Rep. Pocan. \"The Student Loan Refinancing Act will allow nearly 44 million Americans to refinance their student loans, just like a mortgage or car loan. This bill would bring down the long-term cost of a college degree.\"Over the last 30 years, the cost of college has increased by at least 300 percent, forcing some students to take on overwhelming student loan debt and putting a college degree entirely out of reach for others. Student loan debt is now the highest form of personal debt in the nation, reaching over $1.3 trillion for 38 million student loan borrowers across the country. In 2015, the average undergraduate student borrower left school with $30,100 in student loans, which is a 4% increase from 2014.\"College is an increasingly necessary precondition for 21st-century middle-class jobs, and Americans who want to go to college deserve an affordable, accessible pathway to college,\" said American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten. \"That is why this bill is so important: It provides immediate financial relief to millions of students and families, freeing them from unnecessarily burdensome debt, and makes it clear that student loans should help further students\\' lives, not hold them back. President Trump\\'s budget proposals this week curtailing student aid programs--at a time when far too many students incur crippling debt--in pursuit of a higher degree make Rep. Pocan\\'s bill more urgent than ever.\" \"Rep. Pocan\\'s Student Loan Refinancing Act will help hundreds of thousands of borrowers in Wisconsin alone to refinance their student loans, just like you can a mortgage,\" said One Wisconsin Now Executive Director Scot Ross. \"Student loan borrowers did the right thing by working hard to pay for their technical college or university education and allowing them to refinance their loans treats them fairly in a system that\\'s rigged against them and gives them a shot at their piece of the American Dream.\"The bipartisan bill is cosponsored by Reps.

Ms. DeVos, having failed to earn the support of a majority of Senators, had to rely on Vice President Pence\\'s vote to break a 50-50 tie for the first time in U.S. history.\"Today, Senate Republicans voted against the best interests of America\\'s students and working families, and in favor of billionaires, who put profits ahead of the education of our children. Betsy DeVos is unqualified to serve as Secretary of Education because she doesn\\'t believe in public education.  \"DeVos has no experience working in public education, and her recent Senate confirmation hearings demonstrated she lacks the knowledge, experience, and compassion to run a Department of Education that works for all students and puts their interests first. She has worked tirelessly to gut funding for public education and has fought to turn schools into profit-making schemes for her wealthy friends. Student debt and the cost of childcare continue to be two of the most pressing issues in our country, yet DeVos has been silent on bold solutions like debt-free college and universal childcare. And she has a history of opposing equal protections for LGBTQ students.\"Americans have voiced an overwhelming opposition to DeVos\\' nomination. The CPC will continue to fight with these Americans for a strong public school system that serves all students, regardless of their ZIP code. Again, Trump, who promised to drain the swamp and stand up for working people, has betrayed on both scores as he adds yet another billionaire who seeks to line the pockets of their friends at the expense of the American people by privatizing our education.\"###',\n",

       "  'date': 'January 12, 2017',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI), David Cicilline (D-RI), Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), Jared Polis (D-CO) and Mark Takano (D-CA), Co-Chairs of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, today sent a letter to members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) urging them to closely examine Secretary of Education nominee Betsy DeVos\\' views on issues affecting LGBT students and parents during her confirmation process.\"It is unfathomable that the next Secretary of Education would oppose basic protections for LGBT students and roll back the progress we have made to ensure all students feel safe and supported in our schools,\" said Rep. Pocan. \"Ms. DeVos\\' history of opposing equality for LGBT individuals is deeply troubling, and the public deserves to know whether she will work with us to improve lives or continue to advocate an extremist agenda that bullies our students.\"The letter specifically highlights the millions of dollars DeVos and her family have contributed to organizations and candidates that oppose equality for LGBT families and actively promote dangerous practices like \"conversion therapy.\" Rep. Pocan and his colleagues called on Senate HELP Committee members to demand Ms. DeVos denounce these inhumane positions and stand up for policies to protect LGBT students and parents before being confirmed.Below is the text of the letter and you can find a digital copy of the letter here.Dear Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray:            As Co-Chairs of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, we write to express our deep concern with President-elect Donald Trump\\'s nominee for the Secretary of the United States Department of Education, Betsy DeVos. While Ms. DeVos\\' stances on a number of public education issues raise concerns, we cannot hold our silence regarding her opposition to the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students.  Betsy DeVos\\' career has been marked by repeated attempts to undermine the rights of the LGBT community. She and her family have donated extensively to groups which promote the idea that students who identify as LGBT must undergo \"conversion\" therapy and have also affiliated with groups that oppose anti-bullying legislation. The next Secretary of Education must represent all students in our country. Anyone who promotes such fervently anti-LGBT viewpoints is wholly unqualified to serve as the Secretary of Education.              Since 1998, Betsy DeVos and her family\\'s foundations have donated at least $6.1 million to Focus on the Family, a right-wing organization which has spent millions of dollars attempting to defeat marriage equality amendments at the state level. Even more troubling, this organization supported by the DeVos family promotes \"conversion therapy,\" opposes the right of LGBT parents to adopt children, and has referred to transgender individuals as \"mentally ill.\" This organization has even gone so far to oppose anti-bullying policies and opposes basic workplace protections for LGBT individuals. The DeVos family\\'s support for anti-LGBT groups and policies extends beyond just this organization to many other groups known for their anti-LGBT activities, such as: $1,000,000 to the Institute for Marriage and Public Policy, which has claimed that the overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act amounted to a \"fatwa;\"$15,000 to the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which has opposed adoption with same-sex couples;$433,750 to the Council for National Policy, a highly secretive group that is led by extremists like Focus on the Family\\'s James Dobson among other extremists; and $13,498,000 to the Heritage Foundation, which has stated that \"Despite activist judges\\' opinions, the majority of Americans continue to affirm the reasonable conclusion that marriage is the union of one man and one woman.\" The DeVos family does not stop with contributions to intolerant organizations as they also support anti-LGBT politicians. For example, the DeVos family - including Ms. DeVos - were top contributors to Michigan State Representative Andrea LaFontaine, who sponsored legislation allowing adoption agencies to discriminate against LGBT parents and deny them the ability to adopt a child.             The LGBT community has made significant and long overdue advancements when it comes to equality in education. During President Obama\\'s tenure in office, the Department of Education took important steps to combat bullying and ensure that Title IX, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, appropriately reflects the rights of transgender students. It is imperative that the rights of LGBT students are adequately protected moving forward.             As you move to consider the nomination of Betsy DeVos, we strongly encourage you to seek out answers regarding Ms. DeVos\\' stance on important education equity issues, including her views on protecting LGBT students from bullying and discrimination in K-12 and higher education spaces. We are particularly troubled by Betsy DeVos\\' past support for inhumane \"conversion therapy\" treatments and believe it is imperative that any Secretary of Education nominee denounce such practices before being confirmed.             As Members of the LGBT community, we know our schools must be a safe place for all children. As you consider the nomination of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education, we strongly encourage you to stand up for the civil rights of LGBT students and ensure the next Secretary opposes any action to roll back our progress toward equality.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after the Next Generation Researchers Act passed the House & Senate as part of the 21st Century Cures Act. The Next Generation Researchers Act directs the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to promote and provide new opportunities for new researchers and earlier research independence.“I was proud to see the Next Generation Researchers Act pass the House & Senate as part of the 21st Century Cures Act today,” Rep. Pocan said. “This bill reaffirms our commitment to help early career researchers and young innovators pursue their research and ensures the U.S. continues to be the global leader in science research and development. With one of the country’s greatest research universities in my own District, I have heard directly from graduate researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison about the need for investment, coordination and promotion of policies focused on the future of the research workforce in the United States. By providing our young scientists and researchers with more funding opportunities and focused policies they have the support necessary to tackling the challenges of tomorrow. I want to thank Senator Baldwin for her work on this initiative and the countless advocates who worked to get this legislation passed.”The legislation authorizes NIH to establish a “Next Generation of Researchers Initiative” within the NIH Office of the Director to develop and coordinate policies and programs related to young scientists, such as funding opportunities, training and mentorship programs, and policies to enhance workforce diversity. It also funds a study by the National Academies of Science to review career barriers for biomedical researchers, which the NIH will subsequently use to continue to focus and pursue effectively policies promoting the future of the research workforce.\"We are deeply grateful to Congressman Pocan for his dedication and leadership in advancing the 21st Century Cures Act, which includes the Next Generation Researchers Act, which he authored to ensure that we continue our progress in biomedical research,\" said Robert Golden, Dean of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. \"This legislation provides critical support for the development of young researchers, many of whom are working on new cures and therapies right here in Wisconsin.”“As a world class research institution, UW-Madison is home to many researchers who are early in their careers and can benefit from the passage of the Next Generation of Researchers Initiative in the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We are extremely grateful to Representative Pocan for introducing this legislation and shepherding it through bipartisan approval as an investment in the next generation of researchers,” said Marsha Mailick, UW-Madison’s Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education. “Our researchers in the growing biomedical and behavioral research areas are eager for opportunities like this initiative, which seeks to enhance training, provide mentorship programs, and jump start much needed funding for those early in their careers who have great potential to conduct transformative research at UW-Madison.”“Ensuring young researchers have opportunities to pursue their dreams and contribute to faster medical progress is crucial to sustaining our global competitiveness in the life sciences arena, and to the national imperative of faster medical progress,” said Mary Wooley, President and CEO of Research! America. “The inclusion of the “NextGen” Act in the 21st Century Cures bill will help ensure those opportunities proliferate.  We are grateful to Representative Pocan, Senator Baldwin, Senator Collins, and the bill’s other champions for their vision and leadership in championing this strategically important initiative.”“The Next Generation Research Act will enhance career opportunities for younger researchers in the biological and biomedical sciences,” said Howard Garrison, Director of Public Affairs of Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB). “We are grateful for Representative Pocan’s support for the biomedical research community and are pleased that this important legislation was included in the 21st Century Cures Act.”Rep. Pocan introduced the Next Generations Researches Act in September 2015 and Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Susan Collins (R-ME) introduced companion bill in the Senate. Rep. Pocan previously introduced this legislation in the 113th Congress as well.# # #',\n",

       "  'title': 'Pocan Calls on Department of Education to Ensure Proper Oversight of Taxpayer-funded Voucher Schools following GAO Report',\n",
       "  'date': 'September 12, 2016',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) called on the Department of Education to take the necessary steps to ensure proper oversight and encourage accountability of taxpayer-funded voucher schools following the findings of a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report released today. In December of 2014, Rep. Pocan along with Reps. Gwen Moore (D-WI) and Marcia Fudge (D-OH) requested the GAO report after advocates for people with disabilities, including the ACLU and Disability Rights Wisconsin, raised concerns that Wisconsin’s voucher program, either tacitly or explicitly, allowed participating taxpayer-funded voucher schools to discriminate against students with disabilities in their admission policies.“This GAO report confirms our deepest concerns about taxpayer-funded voucher schools,” said Rep. Pocan. “We already know voucher and many charter school programs lack the same levels of accountability and transparency as our public schools, but what this study proves is that many of these schools are also failing to meet the needs of special needs students and in many cases discriminating against them.”“Republicans in Wisconsin and across the country are breaking our public education system by depleting funds from public schools and rerouting them to the comparatively few students in private schools,” continued Rep. Pocan. “Unless we reverse this trend, we will be left with an education system that favors taxpayer-funded voucher and charter schools, with low educational standards and discriminatory practices, at the expense of public schools.”“We cannot justify diverting scarce public funds to finance private school education for a handful of children at the expense of the vast majority of children who attend public schools.  Instead, we should focus our efforts on initiatives that will result in the overall improvement of K-12 schools for all of our nation’s children,\" said Ranking Member, Committee on Education and the Workforce, Bobby Scott (D-VA). “That is the ultimate promise of public education in America; that all students –  regardless of race, ZIP code, or learning ability – deserve the civil rights afforded to them by federal law.  This report shows, yet again, that many students enrolled in private schools using public dollars lack the rights and remedies afforded them by the law. Additionally, the report raises serious questions about the program quality of private schools that continue to siphon public dollars, and I look forward to working with my colleagues and the GAO to further investigate this issue.”“Despite the push—made by some states and trumpeted by some running for political office—to expand private school voucher programs and education savings accounts, this nonpartisan GAO report verifies that vouchers and voucher-like schemes don’t work. They don’t help kids who use them, and they harm the schools that serve kids who don’t use them,” said AFT President Randi Weingarten. \"This report confirms basic facts we have long known: While public schools have the responsibility for all students, many voucher schools take public funding while picking and choosing students based on their academic and behavioral characteristics. Voucher schools don’t abide by the same academic quality standards as public schools. They blur the lines separating church and state, and drain critical funding away from public schools. Finally, vouchers exacerbate inequity—despite what the politicians, billionaires and billionaire politicians who promote them claim. Let’s end the drive to privatize education and, instead, invest resources in public schools so that all students have access to a high-quality neighborhood school.”“The latest GAO study further confirms what many educators and parents across the country know: vouchers do not help the students most in need, they ignore the real opportunity gaps that exist in our public schools today, and they fail to improve student achievement,” said NEA President Lily Eskelsen García. “No matter what you call it – school choice or so-called opportunity scholarships – vouchers siphon dollars away from our public schools to fund private schools at taxpayers’ expense with little to no regard for our students. Students’ chances for success should not depend on securing a voucher or living in the right zip code. If we are serious about doing what works for all of our students, we should focus instead on equipping all students for success and closing the opportunity gaps.”The GAO report found that participation in taxpayer-funded voucher programs and education savings accounts has more than doubled in the last five years while taxpayers have increased spending on these untested programs from $400 million dollars five years ago to $859 million dollars today. Taxpayer-funded voucher schools across the country also lack requirements regarding high educational standards for teachers, discriminate against certain students, and can mandate religious requirements for admission-blurring the lines between separation of church and state. GAO found many schools they studied requested increased guidance from the Department of Education regarding how federal Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) should be used when it comes to servicing taxpayer-funded voucher schools. Among the report’s chief recommendations was a significant need for the Department of Education to clarify funding streams, standards, and services offered by taxpayer funded voucher programs to ensure taxpayers are not footing the bill for programs that aren’t benefiting our children.This study focused on issues around funding and access for all students, including those with disabilities, but future work is still needed on educational outcomes.

       "  'date': 'July 13, 2016',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) introduced The Degrees Not Debt Act. This legislation would create a state-federal partnership program with the Department of Education, states, and public colleges or universities in order to ensure college affordability becomes a reality for all Americans.The bill would reward states which contribute more towards their public university system by providing federal matching dollars to encourage reinvestment. The Degrees Not Debt Act also requires that secondary costs, such as books and housing, for students living at 350% of the poverty line (approx. $85,000/year for a family of four) are fully met through a combination of work study and financial aid awards. This legislation is a critical step towards making debt-free college a reality for working families.                                                                                                          “With student debt skyrocketing, it’s time to create a sustainable path for students to graduate from college with degrees, not debt. This legislation provides an incentive for states to contribute more towards their public universities, while ensuring tuition costs do not continue to rise exorbitantly,” Rep. Pocan said. “In addition to tuition, The Degrees Not Debt Act would also cover housing and textbooks for low-income students, which are often an additional cost barrier. I am proud to introduce this legislation with Congressman Ellison so we can help make college affordable and accessible for everyone.\"“Today, a college degree is more important than it’s ever been – and going to college has never been more expensive. Public universities used to be affordable for almost every student who wanted to attend,” Rep. Ellison said. “But the cost of getting a higher education, and the crippling loan debt most students are forced to shoulder, makes it harder for millions of young Americans to buy a house, open a business, or start a family. This bill would ensure that the cost of going to college, from tuition to books to campus meal plans, don’t get in anyone’s way.”“When students walk across the stage on graduation day, they should take their diplomas with them into a brighter future,” continued Rep. Ellison. “That’s a promise every single public college and university should be able to make. Our debt-free college plan will help our schools make that promise. And it’ll help them keep it.”“Students, particularly those from working class backgrounds and communities of color, have borne the brunt of crippling and counterproductive cuts to public colleges and universities for over three decades,” said Heather McGhee, President of Demos. “The ability to attend and graduate college without debt was once the norm, and returning to that system requires a new federal-state partnership that encourages states to reinvest in public higher education and targets resources at students for whom college has simply become unaffordable. We applaud this effort and believe it is urgently needed in order to renew the promise of affordable and debt-free public college.”Public colleges and universities rely heavily on state funding to operate and keep the cost of tuition low. In the last decade, state funding for public higher education has declined due to state budget cuts, lingering economic slowdown following the Great Recession of 2008, and other factors. Today, state funding for public institutions remains below the pre-recession average, and according to the think tank Demos, the decline in state support was responsible for almost 80% of the rise in tuition costs between 2001 and 2011.The Degrees Not Debt Act would provide federal grants to public universities in states that have committed to reinvesting state-based revenue in higher education. The bill sets federal matching rates based on how much funding a state provides for public higher education operating support on a per student basis, compared and indexed to the maximum Pell Grant award.How the Bill Would Work:Step 1: States agree to participate in the program.Step 2: A state would receive a federal match grant based on how much the state provides public universities.Step 3: Public universities commit to meeting the financial needs of students at 350% of the poverty line (families earning approx. $85,000).Step 4: Public universities commit to keep tuition rates indexed to inflation, with the option to seek a waiver pending extenuating circumstances including years of being locked into previous budget cuts.                                                 Result: Tuition costs would be controlled for students and universities would receive a greater investment from both the state and federal government while ensuring the full financial needs of students at 350% of the poverty line are met.The legislation is also supported by the following groups: AFL-CIO, Americans for Democratic Action, Coalition on Human Needs, Daily Kos, National Education Association (NEA), MoveOn, American Federation of Teachers (AFT), Young Invincibles, Economic Policy Institute, Progressive Change Campaign Committee, The Institute for College Access and Success (TICAS), and Demos.# # #',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after the Simplifying the Application for Student Aid Act of 2016 passed the House. Earlier this year Rep. Pocan and Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV) introduced the legislation, which makes President Obama’s executive action to allow for the use of Prior-Prior Year tax data for students permanent – helping students make timely financial decisions about their education.“This bipartisan legislation is an important step towards making college more affordable and will help streamline the process for students applying to college,” said Rep. Pocan. “Allowing students to use prior years’ tax data means a student can apply for financial aid at the same time they apply for college. This ensures students get information about financial aid, which will help them make their college choice, much earlier.”SIMPLIFYING THE APPLICATION FOR STUDENT AID ACT:·   Allows students to use family income data from two years prior to the date of the FAFSA application. This process will help students apply for financial aid earlier so they can better prepare for their college costs.·   Improves the ability to link between the online FAFSA form and income tax data stored by the Internal Revenue Service to automatically input income data into the FAFSA form, reducing the need to manually input information that often prevents low-income students from applying for aid.·   Strengthens the integrity of federal financial aid by providing institutions more time to verify the income of their students. ·   Additionally, the legislation will also direct the Department of Education to develop a mobile app for the FAFSA. This will allow millions of Americans who do not have broadband access, but do have internet connectivity on their phones to have access to an electronic version of FAFSA.# # #',\n",

       "  'date': 'July 1, 2016',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), Rep. Rick Nolan (D-MN), and Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL) introduced the Relief for Underwater Student Borrowers Act. The bill would allow student loan borrowers who have been granted debt relief as a result of consistent repayment towards their student loan debt an exemption from being taxed on the amount forgiven.“With college debt skyrocketing, Congress should be doing everything it can to help reduce the crushing burden of student debt,” Rep. Pocan said. “Currently, when a student loan borrower has their debt forgiven, the waived loan amount is still subject to individual income taxes. This leaves borrowers on the hook for potentially massive tax bills. The Relief for Underwater Student Borrowers Act would prevent student loan borrowers from being hit with that additional tax burden and gives them the opportunity to get out from under those loans.”“The heart of our economic success as a nation is education and preparation of our youth,” Rep. Nolan said. “And as a former teacher, I know there is no better investment than in the education of our next generation. Students shouldn’t have to drown in debt just to go to school and get an education. I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing this legislation to relieve some of this burden.”“The Relief for Underwater Student Borrowers Act is a common-sense solution to an all too common problem: paying off the high cost of higher education. The average college student today graduates owing more than $30,000 in student loan debt and many leave school owing a great deal more. That is an enormous burden for a young person struggling to build a future in an uncertain economy that can take more than 20 years to repay,” said Rep. Wilson, Ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections. “This legislation would give borrowers who have been granted debt relief as a result of consistent loan repayment a tax exemption on the amount forgiven. It would be wrong to forgive a debt that was already a struggle to repay only to replace it with a new financial encumbrance. I urge all members of Congress to support this bill.”                                                          Over the last 30 years, the cost of college has increased by at least 300 percent, forcing some students to take on overwhelming student loan debt and putting a college degree entirely out of reach for others. Student loan debt is now the highest form of personal debt in the nation, reaching over $1.3 trillion for 38 million student loan borrowers across the country. Students graduating from public universities leave with an average of $28,950 of debt.Under current law, the balance forgiven under Income Based Repayment (IBR) or Pay as You Earn (PAYE) is treated as taxable income to the borrower, creating a tax liability that most qualifying borrowers would be unable to finance.President Obama formally widened the pool of eligible participants in the Pay As You Earn Program (PAYE), which will help an estimated additional 5 million people manage their debt. Individuals who participate in this program as well as other loan forgiveness programs are taxed on the balance of their forgiven loan, often leaving borrowers even further in debt. While most of these individuals will pay off their loans long before the 20 year mark, those individuals still struggling to pay their loans by the 20th year should be able to discharge their loan debt without incurring an onerous tax liability.This legislation has been endorsed by: The Institute for College Access and Success (TICAS), Young Invincibles, the Association of State Colleges and Universities, the Council for Opportunity in Education, U.S. PIRG, Equal Justice Works and the American Council for Education.# # #',\n",

Mark Pocan (D-WI) released statements today after Rep. Pocan offered the CPC’s debt-free college resolution as an amendment to the House Republican budget. First introduced in April 2015 by the CPC co-chairs along with Senators Schatz, Schumer and Warren, the resolution prioritizes making debt free college a reality.Over the last 30 years, the cost of college has increased by 300 percent, forcing some students to take on overwhelming student loan debt and putting a college degree entirely out of reach for others. Student loan debt is now the highest form of personal debt in the nation, reaching over $1.3 trillion for 38 million student loan borrowers across the country. Students graduating from public universities leave with an average of $28,950 of debt.“A college education is an essential tool for getting into the middle class. Yet it’s become all too common to accept the fact that students must graduate with crushing levels of debt,” Rep. Pocan said. “It’s time to end the reliance on debt as a way to finance a college education. We need to work with students, universities, states, and the federal government to ensure college is affordable and accessible for everyone.”“Education remains the single greatest avenue of upward mobility our society has ever known,” Rep. Grijalva said.  “If Republicans truly want their budget to create an economy and a society that works for every American, then they should ensure a college degree is within reach for anyone committed to earning it. I commend Rep. Pocan for fighting for students today. The fact that the GOP failed to accept his amendment speaks volumes about the vision they want their budget to be.”“Too many students are forced to choose between continuing their education or a lifetime of debt,” Rep. Ellison said. “The financial burden of student loans limits the career choices of students and their ability to buy homes, save, or start a family. If we want to make sure that going to college doesn't mean giving up a secure future, we must make college affordable. Debt free college is a way to ensure that anyone who wants a brighter future is able to seek one without crushing debt.”In April 2015, members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and Senators Schatz, Schumer, and Warren introduced resolutions in the House and Senate supporting efforts to ensure that students have access to debt-free higher education. The House Resolution, H. Res. 214, currently has 78 Democratic cosponsors and the Senate Resolution has 23 cosponsors.# # #\",\n",

Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, spoke on the House Floor in support of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Reauthorization, the Every Student Succeeds Act. The bipartisan bill passed the House last night by a vote of 359-64 and the Senate is expected to finalize it next week. This is the first reauthorization of the ESEA since the expiration of No Child Left Behind in 2007.You can find a video clip of Rep. Pocan speaking on the Floor here.\"I rise in support of the Every Student Succeeds Act. Defending public education is one of the reasons I came to Congress.For years, we\\'ve witnessed a negative impact on public education from underfunding our schools and to stripping teachers of their rights to collectively bargain for fair pay and conditions. At the same time, punitive policies which limit teachers\\' and administrators\\' abilities to manage their classrooms have further hampered student achievement. In my home state, attacks on public education are made on a regular basis. And nationally our dialogue surrounding K-12 education has lacked the input of local educators, parents and communities. It\\'s past time we renew the promise of an ESEA which has students\\' best interests at heart.I meet with teachers and administrators from Wisconsin\\'s 2nd Congressional District regularly and was stunned when I was told one third of a school\\'s staff turned over last year because schools lack the financial support and autonomy they need to give students the educational experience they deserve. Teachers are being asked to do more with less and it\\'s coming at the expense of our kids\\' education.A 2014 Alliance for Excellent Education student demonstrated that 13% of the nation\\'s 3.4 million teachers move schools or leave the profession every year. Close to 40-50% of teachers leave the job entirely within 5 years of starting.And while this bill is far from perfect, I am pleased that we are finally discussing a bill today that aims to put students first and trusts the teachers who dedicate their careers to education.This bill trusts and empowers teachers to ensure their voices are heard on the federal, state, and local level while increasing teacher quality and professional development, and reducing the burden of testing in schools.Those are good improvements, Mr. Speaker, good for our nation\\'s children, and that\\'s why I support this bill.\"',\n",

Perkins Loans are need-based loans which foster access to higher education for low-income students by providing low interest loans to students in need.Colleges and Universities tailor the program to best fit borrowers\\' and institutions\\' situations. Perkins is a risk-sharing program with institutions contributing one-third of their students\\' awards.

Perkins Loans borrowers are predominantly from lower income families and are often the first in their family to attend college. Perkins Loans have a set interest rate of 5 percent, which begins to accrue 9 months after the borrower ceases to be a student. However this program has not been reauthorized since 2009.Besides making higher education accessible for low-income students, this program serves as an incentive for people who wish to go into public service by offering targeted loan cancellations for specific progression in areas of national need including teaching, nursing, and law enforcement.Earlier this year, I introduced a bipartisan resolution in support of Perkins Loans with Congressman Messer, H. Res. 294 with 56 cosponsors. My colleague, Rep. Louise Slaughter, a leader on this issue, authored a letter with more than 90 bipartisan signatures in support of this important program.

The pioneering efforts of these new researchers, in areas such as biochemistry and neuroscience, will lead to improved health and quality of life for Americans and spurs innovation, U.S. economic growth, and job creation.\"Over the past ten years, the purchasing power of the NIH has decreased 22 percent while our global competitors have ramped up their own research capabilities. Sequestration cut an additional $1.5 billion from the NIH budget. These destructive policies are particularly devastating for our nation\\'s young researchers like UW-Madison graduate students Tyler and Andrew.\"One of the biggest challenges my colleagues and I face as we transition from PhD students to postdoctoral researchers is the lack of career and funding opportunities for young researchers,\" said Tyler Stanage, graduate student Cox Lab Biochemistry Department at UW-Madison. \"This has dissuaded the majority of my colleagues from pursuing careers in academic research - an incredible loss to the potential economic, medical, and scholarly advances they may have brought with their work.\"\"I frequently hear about the difficulties scientists face in obtaining grants for research, and it can be discouraging,\" said Andrew Merluzzi, graduate student in the Neuroscience and Public Policy Program at UW-Madison. \"The uncertainty in funding makes a career in basic research much less enticing, which is an unfortunate fact. I think we need mechanisms by which young researchers can obtain the funds they need to get innovative ideas off the ground. I hope that legislation like the Next Generation Researchers Act can help do that.\"The Next Generation Researchers Act currently has 9 original cosponsors and is supported by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Medical College of Wisconsin, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), FASEB, Research!America, American Society of Transplantation (AST) American Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC), American Heart Association, and AcademyHealth.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C – Today, U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Louise Slaughter (D-NY) stood with education advocacy organizations and students to urge Congress to reauthorize the Federal Perkins Loan program before it expires on September 30th. The Federal Perkins Loan is a need-based loan, which fosters access to higher education for low-income students by providing low interest loans to students in need.\"A college education open doors to greater job opportunities and financial stability. At a time where higher education costs are skyrocketing, Congress needs to do everything it can to ensure that students are able to attend college without being weighed down with mountains of debt,\" said Rep. Pocan. \"The Perkins Loan Program is a vital tool to help make college accessible and affordable for all students. Perkins Loans have helped students struggling to find a way to pay for college in Wisconsin. I urge my Congressional Colleagues to reauthorize this program and ensure students have the ability to attend college without being held back by debt.\"Nationwide, over 500,000 students are awarded Perkins Loans every year. These student borrowers are predominantly from lower income families and are often the first in their family to attend college. 67% of Perkins borrowers are dependent students, in which 34% of them come from families with household incomes of less than $30,000. Last year, the University of Wisconsin System awarded $28.8 million dollars in loans to 15,829 students during the \\'13-\\'14 school year. If the Perkins Loan is eliminated, students in Wisconsin, New York and across the country will not be able to access much-needed financial aid.\"Last week, I stood with the college and university presidents in my district representing over 6,000 students who receive Perkins funds to call for immediate action to save the Perkins Loan Program,\" said Rep. Slaughter. \"Perkins Loans are special and a good investment all around: they are available to low-income students, have a low, capped interest rate, and are administered by the colleges and paid back to that college, creating a revolving system. Students should be studying for their next exam, not worrying whether they can afford their next semester. The loss of Perkins Loans would be an unrecoverable blow to the 500,000 students across the country who rely on them.\"In June 2015, Rep. Pocan along with Rep. Messer (R-IN) introduced a bipartisan resolution, with 50 cosponsors, in support of the Perkins Loan Program. A broad coalition of education, financial aid groups, and colleges support the Perkins Loans Program. Rep. Slaughter (D-NY) also sent a bipartisan letter last week, along with 94 of her colleagues, to the leaders of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce urging immediate action to save the Perkins Loan Program.',\n",

Jared Polis (D-CO), Joe Heck (R-NV), and Phil Roe (R-TN), members of the House Education and Workforce Committee, introduced the Simplifying the Application for Student Aid Act, H.R. 3177, a bill which would simplify the student financial aid process.\"Federal financial aid is essential to ensure that college is accessible for students in Wisconsin and all across the country,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"The current student financial aid application process is overly complex and often results in students missing opportunities to receive much needed aid. Allowing students and families to access financial aid information earlier provides them with the opportunity to make better-informed decisions about their higher education plans. This bipartisan legislation will ensure more students are able to access federal financial aid to make college more affordable.\"\"I applaud Rep. Pocan for his leadership in using \"Prior Prior Year\" in the Federal student aid application process. This important legislation is nothing short of transformational for students who rely on financial aid to attend college,\" said Susan Fischer, Director of Financial Aid at UW-Madison. \"This straightforward change will allow families to report more accurate information on the FAFSA, will allow earlier submission of the FAFSA and ultimately allow for earlier aid notification by schools. This bill is extremely important to especially first generation students who may be on the fence regarding attending a post-secondary school; it is quite simply a win-win proposition.\"\"One of our top priorities is providing more students easier access to an affordable, quality higher education,\" said Ray Cross, President of the University of Wisconsin System. \"Making income data available earlier and more accessible for families—particularly families with low-income and first-generation students—gives them the time, support, and confidence they need to make one of the most important decisions and investments of their lives.\"The Simplifying the Application for Student Aid Act would allow students to use family income data from two years prior to the date of the FAFSA application. It would also allow income tax data to be automatically inputted into the FAFSA forms and give universities more time to verify the income of their students. The bill currently has 19 original cosponsors, including 9 Republican Members of Congress.Rep. Pocan, along with a bipartisan group of Senators and House Members previously sent a letter to Department of Education Secretary Arne Duncan asking the Department of Ed to allow students to use prior-prior income data.# # #',\n",

Currently, many students across the country are receiving their college admissions letters without the accompanying financial aid award information they need to compare college options and costs.\"Earlier and more accurate financial aid award information would allow students and families, and especially low-income and first generation students, to make better-informed decisions about their educational careers,\" the Members of Congress wrote. \"Unfortunately, the current limitation on the tax data students and families can use on the FAFSA has created a highly disjointed process and timeline. The complexity of the financial aid application process also undermines educational aspirations, enrollment, and persistence. Resolving this situation will be an important priority for our work to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. However, we do not need to wait to provide students and families much-needed relief. The Department can and should improve the process of filling out the FAFSA right now.\"Most families\\' incomes do not change significantly from year-to-year, yet the current process forces applicants to wait until January 1 of each year—far after many college application deadlines—to complete the FAFSA in the same year they plan to enroll using the prior year\\'s tax data. When the FAFSA becomes available, many students and their families struggle to obtain tax documents quickly enough for dozens of local, state and private grant deadlines. The short window provided for filing taxes before filling out the FAFSA places students and families in a difficult situation with few good options.Under their authority, the Department can allow students to use prior-prior year data, which is more likely to be on file and much easier to import directly into the FAFSA. This will speed up the application process and help reduce the burden of verification for documenting their financial situation and aid eligibility. Prior-prior year data is also not likely to have a significant effect on students\\' financial aid awards.  Financial aid administrators, admissions officers, state grant agencies, and college access programs also strongly support using this data.Read the Senate and House letters.Joining Baldwin, Mikulski, Bennet, Booker, and Murray in the Senate were: Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Al Franken (D-MN), Edward Markey (D-MA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Jon Tester (D-MT), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Chris Coons (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Jack Reed (D-RI), Angus King, Jr. (I-ME), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Bernard Sanders (I-VT), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Charles Schumer (D-NY).Joining Pocan and Doggett in the House were: Representatives Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR), Cheri Bustos (D-IL), Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Larry Buschon (R-IN), Raul Grijalva (D-AZ), Alcee Hastings (D-FL), Ron Kind (D-WI), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), William Keating (D-MA), Ruben Hinojosa (D-TX), Sander Levin (D-MI), Gwen Moore (D-WI), Charles Rangel (D-NY), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Bobby Scott (D-VA), Frederica Wilson (D-FL), Dennis Ross (R-FL), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), Andre Carson (D-IN), Suzan DelBene (D-WA), Ted Deutch (D-FL), Bill Foster (D-IL), Derek Kilmer (D-WA), Jared Polis (D-CO), Peter Welch (D-VT), and Dan Kildee (D-MI).  ###',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. — U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, today introduced legislation to allow student loan borrowers to refinance their loans. The bill, first introduced in 2013, would allow nearly 40 million Americans to refinance their federal student loans any time a lower interest rate is available.\"College graduates are drowning in loan payments and it\\'s weighing down our economy,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"The federal government should prioritize making a college education as affordable and accessible as possible. Today, two-thirds of Americans leave college weighed down by crushing student loan debt making it harder for them to start achieving their dreams or contribute to the economy after graduation.\"This bill will allow nearly 40 million Americans to refinance their student loans, just like a mortgage or car loan, bringing down the long-term cost of a college degree and increasing economic opportunities for graduates,\" Rep. Pocan continued. \"Every Member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, needs to realize this is a serious economic problem which needs to be addressed. Our economy will never reach its full potential as long as Americans are weighed down by massive student loan debt.\"According to the New York Federal Reserve, total student debt has quadrupled over the past 10 years, shooting up from $240 billion at the start of 2003 to nearly $1 trillion in 2013. A comprehensive report on student loan debt by the Institute for One Wisconsin found student loan debt has a dramatic, negative effect on Wisconsin\\'s and the nation\\'s economy – impacting new home and car sales.  Of the more than $1.2 trillion in total student debt in this country, 83 percent is from federal student loans.\"Millions of American have worked hard to get an education and took on the personal responsibility to pay for it.

Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Mike Honda (D-CA), along with U.S. Senators Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), today introduced the Providing Resources Early for Kids (PRE-K) Act, legislation to expand access to high-quality early learning programs for children from birth to age five. The PRE-K Act helps more kids arrive at kindergarten ready to succeed by establishing federal-state partnerships, incentivizing states to both improve the quality of state preschool programs and expand to serve more children in need. \"High-quality early education is essential to a student\\'s long-term academic success,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"The PRE-K Act will encourage states to make critical investments in our nation\\'s future and provide better preschool opportunities for children. Improving educational outcomes depends on reaching children early to ensure kids are prepared to succeed.\"\"The Pre-K Act makes critical investments in our nation\\'s early-education programs,\" Rep. Mike Honda said.  \"The matching grants for Pre-K programs and certification requirements for Pre-K teachers are sensible steps to improve our early education system. These steps are a key component of the Equity and Excellence Commission\\'s recommendations for tackling the inequity problem in our schools, and I am excited to sponsor legislation that translates those recommendations into action. We need to keep working to ensure that each and every child gets an excellent education, starting as early as possible.\" \"The investments we make in our youngest keiki are paid back in full by enhancing our nation\\'s competitiveness in our global economy,\" said Senator Hirono. \"Hawaii educators have told me that many kids start kindergarten already behind. Our children deserve the best chance to succeed and our educators need all the tools we can give them to put students on track to being lifelong learners. That\\'s why, beginning when I was Hawaii\\'s Lieutenant Governor 20 years ago, I have been committed to quality early learning to help kids start kindergarten ready to succeed. Where you live should not determine what chance you get in life, and this bill will ensure states like Hawaii can create effective, quality state preschool programs. This bill focuses on quality because it is what makes the biggest difference in educational outcomes. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate and moving this bill forward.\"\"Throughout our history, Wisconsin has made real investments in early childhood education because we understand that a strong start helps build a strong middle class. Our nation must make it a priority to invest in early education for all, so that the doors of opportunity are open to every child and help provide them the skills they need to realize their dreams,\" said Senator Baldwin. \"I\\'m proud to join this effort to renew our commitment to the proven foundation we know that early childhood education provides. This is a critical investment for our middle class and for our future.\"A recent White House report summarizes what decades of research has shown: high quality early learning yields over $8 for every $1 invested, by helping kids learn to read at grade level, stay in school, avoid crime, get good jobs, and pay taxes. The PRE-K Act creates a new federal-state partnership to improve and expand state preschool programs to serve more children in need. States that already have a high-quality preschool program could get grants to expand and serve more children. Other states with small or newer programs could apply for startup funds if they submit a plan to establish a high-quality preschool program within two years. PRE-K Act funds could help states hire and train early educators; expand preschool days and hours; or provide comprehensive services such as health screenings and meals.The PRE-K Act was introduced with the following original House and Senate cosponsors: Reps. Alcee Hastings (D-FL), Rep. David Price (D-NC), and Rep.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) has asked the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) for a review of Wisconsin’s Parental Choice voucher program, specifically examining how this program has lacked accountability standards and transparency. A GAO review will provide a thorough examination and shed light on the program’s shortcomings. This non-partisan review will help to better inform the national discussion on the importance of supporting public schools.  Full text of the letter is available here. “Every child in Wisconsin and across the United States deserves the right to a high-quality education,” said Rep. Mark Pocan. “Before Governor Walker tries to expand the state’s voucher program, Wisconsin taxpayers deserve to know more about the widespread reports of discrimination against students with disabilities and the insufficient academic accountability of choice schools.”“We owe it to every student to ensure publicly funded schools – including voucher schools – provide high-quality education and protect the rights of students with disabilities,” continued Rep. Pocan. “I look forward to the GAO’s thorough non-partisan review of Wisconsin’s voucher program and clear answers to the questions we have raised.”Wisconsin’s voucher program is central to an emerging national debate over the privatization of public education.  Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and many in the Republican Party have pushed the idea of expanding voucher schools nationwide – using Wisconsin as the model – without safeguarding the needs of students with disabilities and ensuring schools meet high standards of academic achievement. Advocates for people with disabilities, including the ACLU and Disability Rights Wisconsin, have raised concerns that Wisconsin’s school choice program, either tacitly or explicitly, allows participating choice schools to discriminate against students with disabilities in their admission policies. After numerous complaints, the U.S. Department of Justice launched an ongoing investigation into Wisconsin’s School Choice program, and sent a letter in 2013 urging the Wisconsin Department of Instruction do more to “enforce the federal statutory and regulatory requirements” under the Americans with Disabilities Act.A recent study by the Wisconsin State Journal revealed Wisconsin has spent $139 million on school vouchers to private schools that were eventually disqualified from the state’s program. Eleven schools participating in the program were removed within a year of opening due to poor educational standards, which costs taxpayers $4.1 million dollars. Students with disabilities are underrepresented at Wisconsin voucher schools. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, of the approximately 21,000 students who attend private schools using state-subsidized vouchers, 1.6% are identified as having special education plans. This contrasts sharply with the nearly 20% of the approximately 81,000 students enrolled in Milwaukee Public Schools who have special education plans in place. Notably, in the Racine Unified School District, choice schools reported only 1 student with a disability attending their schools, out of the 165 special needs students in the entire school district.',\n",

Gwen Moore (WI-04) and Ron Kind (WI-03), urging Governor Walker to apply for a Preschool Development Expansion Grant. Unfortunately, Governor Scott Walker failed to submit an application before Wednesday\\'s deadline depriving Wisconsin of up to $60 million for preschool programs. Since taking office in 2010, Governor Walker has turned down or ignored federal grant opportunities to expand Medicaid for 87,000 Wisconsinites, to expand high speed internet service for schools, to build a high speed rail system between Madison and Milwaukee, and refused to increase the amount of heating assistance given to people in poverty resulting in cuts to Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. \"I\\'m very disappointed Scott Walker has put Tea Party politics ahead of doing his job as Governor,\" Rep. Pocan said. \"Playing political games with these federal grant opportunities, while neglecting our infrastructure, ignoring our most vulnerable citizens and running up a projected $1.9 billion deficit is inexcusable. Too many people from Wisconsin are being left behind as Walker prioritizes his higher ambitions.\"Gov. Walker has failed to take advantage of the following federal grant opportunities: Preschool Development Expansion GrantWisconsin was one of 36 states invited to apply for a share of $250 million in grants directed to help states develop and expand high-quality preschool programs for children from low- and moderate-income levels. Governor Walker missed the deadline of October 15 to apply for this grant. The Preschool Development Expansion Grant will award selected states with up to 15 million dollars a year for a period of 4 years.Medicaid ExpansionIn February of 2013, Walker turned down federal money to expand Medicaid in the state of Wisconsin. The expansion would apply to those who earn up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or $15,282.Broadband ExpansionWalker returned $23 million to the federal government in 2011. This money could have been used to expand high-speed internet service in schools, libraries, and government agencies.High-speed Rail ProjectIn 2010, governor-elect Walker turned away $810 million in federal stimulus money aimed at creating a high-speed train system between Milwaukee and Madison. It\\'s estimated that ending the project cost the state as many as 13,719 jobs.Food-stamp IncreaseRecently, Wisconsin ended a program that allowed residents access to increased food assistance paid for by the federal government through \"heat-and-eat\" programs. As a result of the states\\' decision not to increase the amount of heating assistance given to people in poverty, Wisconsin will see cuts in federal Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program (SNAP, or food stamps) benefits.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (WI-02), Ron Kind (WI-03), and Gwen Moore (WI-04) sent a letter today to Governor Scott Walker urging him to apply for the Preschool Development Expansion Grant.  Wisconsin is one of 36 states invited to apply for a share of $250 million in grants directed to help states develop and expand high-quality preschool programs for children from low- and moderate-income levels.The Governor\\'s Office missed the September 11 deadline to notify the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services of Wisconsin\\'s intention to apply. With one week left until the application deadline, the Governor\\'s Office has still not indicated that it will apply for the grant – potentially leaving millions of dollars for pre-K education on the table.They write, \"We strongly urge your administration to apply for this grant funding opportunity and allow our state the chance to compete for funding which could strengthen preschool programs for millions of children across our state.\"Wisconsin is eligible for up to $15 million dollars a year in funding for a period of four years. The funding would allow some districts to expand 4-year-old kindergarten to full-day kindergarten and improve the quality of instruction for children across Wisconsin.  Currently, most districts have 4-year-old kindergarten, but the state funding only pays for an average of only 2.5 hours per day.The letter continues, \"In light of reports indicating that the achievement gap among students of color and their white peers is growing in Wisconsin, it is critical that our state exercise every option when it comes to accessing grant funding to support early education initiatives.\"The full text of the letter can be found here and below.The Honorable Scott WalkerGovernor of Wisconsin115 E. CapitolMadison, WI 53703Dear Governor Walker:On August 18, 2014 the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services notified the state of Wisconsin of its eligibility to apply for federal funding through the Preschool Development Expansion Grants. We are pleased that Wisconsin was identified as one of 36 states eligible for this grant, which was based on the state\\'s current program and the existing need to expand critical preschool services to more children in Wisconsin. The Preschool Development Expansion Grant will award selected states with up to 15 million dollars a year for a period of 4 years.Preschool Development Expansion Grants were created to support State and local efforts to strengthen programs in states that have been awarded with a Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge grant. According to the Department of Education, the Preschool Development and Expansion Grants will be awarded to states which have successfully implemented and sustained High-Quality Preschool Programs that reach and service vulnerable children in high needs communities.The deadline to notify the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services of a state\\'s intention to apply was September 11, 2014. We were deeply concerned to learn that our state did not notify the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services of its intention to apply for this grant which could bring millions of dollars\\' worth of funding to our preschool programs. The final deadline to apply for the grant is October 15, 2014.We strongly urge your administration to apply for this grant funding opportunity and allow our state the chance to compete for funding which could strengthen preschool programs for millions of children across our state. While the deadline for this grant is quickly approaching and capacity may be an issue, we would also urge your administration to ensure that adequate staff is in place in order to respond to such opportunities in the future. Wisconsin has long been a leader in early learning and we must not miss any chance to expand opportunities for our children.  In light of reports indicating that the achievement gap among students of color and their white peers is growing in Wisconsin, it is critical that our state exercise every option when it comes to accessing grant funding to support early education initiatives. Providing children with high-quality preschool and early learning opportunities is imperative to ensuring that children, especially those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, are able to enter the classroom on a more level playing field.Sincerely,Mark Pocan                              Ron Kind                               Gwen Moore                                                                                  Member of Congress              Member of Congress           Member of Congress                                                                     ###',\n",

Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, today introduced the Student Loan Interest Deduction Fairness Act, H.R. 5508. This bill would help low-income households who have made payments on their loans access greater equity in receiving the Student Loan Interest Deduction currently available to borrowers.\"Student loan debt is disproportionally affecting low-income households – burdening them with financial adversity and weighing down our economy,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"This bill will fix an inequity in our tax code and help these families, which hold 58 percent of all student debt, pay off their crushing levels of student loan debt.\"Today, the average student graduates with around $29, 400 in loans, but 58% of all student debt is held by families in the bottom 25% of household incomes. Nationally, student debt tops 1.2 trillion. The Student Loan Interest Deduction Fairness Act is supported by Supported by the American Council on Education, Association of Public-Land Grant Universities, Equal Justice Works and One Wisconsin Now. Rep. Pocan is also the sponsor of several bills targeted at addressing the student loan debt crisis including the Federal Student Loan Refinancing Act, H.R. 4622, and the Relief for Underwater Student Borrowers Act, H.R. 5239.BACKGROUNDToday, the average student graduates with around $29, 400 in loans. 58% of all student debt is held by families in the bottom 25% of household incomes. Nationally, student debt tops 1.2 trillion.  Given the extent of the student debt crisis, it is essential we give borrowers who have been crushed by student debt the opportunity to contribute productively to our economy.Under the tax code, individuals are able to receive up to a $2,500 tax deduction for interest paid on student loans, but when a couple is married and files jointly, they are subject to this inequity and the couple can only receive a maximum $2,500 as opposed to before the marriage when each person could file and each receive up to $2,500.The Student Loan Interest Deduction Fairness Act, H.R. 5508, would allow married couples to access up to the full $5,000 benefit, which would have been available to individuals prior to marriage.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. — U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, today at a meeting with faculty and staff at the University of Wisconsin – Madison introduced the Next Generation Research Act which would improve opportunities for early career researchers. Unfortunately, current policies, including the budget sequester, are putting the brakes on research and innovation at a time when we need to step on the accelerator. Over the past ten years, the purchasing power of the NIH has decreased 22 percent while our global competitors have ramped up their own research capabilities. Last year, sequestration cut an additional $1.5 billion from the NIH budget.The bill, introduced in the Senate by Senator Tammy Baldwin, creates the Next Generation of Research Initiative within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of the Director and also directs a comprehensive study on the best possible ways our country can invest in the next generation of research.\"In order to foster long-term economic growth, we need to make a strong commitment to supporting research, innovation, science, and technology,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"This bill will ensure the next generation of researchers has the support they need to tackle the challenges of tomorrow. As our economy continues to recover, we must look down the road and invest in our young researchers, whose pioneering research will lead to improved health and quality of life for Americans and spurs innovation, U.S. economic growth, and job creation.\"Over the past 10 years, individual NIH research awards have dropped to record lows, less than 20 percent of grants submitted are funded. Even fewer grants are going to early career researchers, the young innovative researchers. Without these critical investments young Americans are not pursuing degrees in STEM fields, instead choosing a different career path or leaving the country for better research opportunities. Biomedical and scientific research is a major generator of economic activity, and NIH is its largest funding source.\"Federally funded research helps lead to lifesaving medical innovations and technological breakthroughs which can lead to a revolutionary new industry,\" continued Rep. Pocan. \"Congress has shirked its responsibility in recent years to be the driver of federally funded research. This bill helps early-career researchers and graduate students gain access to NIH grants to expand their research opportunities.\"What This Legislation Does:The bill creates the Next Generation of Research Initiative within the NIH Office of the Director.The office will promote and expand current policies and grant opportunities for young scientists.The office will also create new policies aimed at increasing access to NIH grants for new researchers, expand workforce diversity efforts and improving mentorship between veteran and new researchers (only 1 in 6 first time researchers succeed in receiving a second NIH grant).The bill also directs a comprehensive study on the best possible ways our country can establish the next generation of research.Why We Need This Legislation:In order to foster long-term economic growth, we need to make a strong commitment to supporting research, innovation, science, and technology. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) alone added more than $62 billion in new economic activity and the creation of 432,094 jobs across the country in 2011.Over the past ten years, the purchasing power of the NIH has decreased 22 percent while our global competitors have ramped up their own research capabilities. Last year, Sequestration cut an additional $1.5 billion from the NIH budget.These destructive policies are particularly devastating for our nation\\'s young researchers. NIH Director, Dr. Francis Collins, cautioned that \"we are putting an entire generation of scientists at risk.\" Currently, the average age of a first-time NIH grant recipient is 42 years old—up from 36 in 1980. Without action, talented young scientists may decide to chase another career, or leave the country to pursue their research.Current Groups Supporting the Bill:The Association of American Medical Colleges, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACSCAN), University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Wisconsin Health Science Library Association, the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries, the Medical Library Association, and the Midwest Chapter of the Medical Library Association.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. — U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) and U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson (FL-24), both members of the House Education and Workforce Committee, today introduced the Relief for Underwater Student Borrowers Act, H.R. 5239. This bill would allow student loan borrowers who have been granted debt relief as a result of consistent repayment towards their student loan debt an exemption from being taxed on the amount forgiven.\"Student loan debt is weighing down our economy and holding back a generation of Americans as total student loan debt has grown to more than $1.2 trillion – more than total U.S. credit card debt,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"This legislation closes a major gap in our tax code which penalizes some borrowers who have been granted debt relief after at least 20 years of consistent repayment towards their student loan debt.\"\"As a member of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training, college affordability is one of my top priorities. Today, student debt is at a record high, with individual debt forcing many people to put off major purchases such as buying a home or automobile,\" said Congresswoman Wilson. \"This bill prevents student loan borrowers from being hit with an additional tax burden for debt that has been forgiven after 20 years of consistent repayment, and in the event of suffering a total permanent disability or death, this bill prevents the debt forgiven from being considered taxable income. The Relief for Underwater Student Borrowers Act helps individual borrowers and their families, as well as strengthens the economy.\"Background:Under current law, the student loan balance forgiven as part of the Income Based Repayment (IBR) or Pay as You Earn (PAYE) programs, is treated as taxable income to the borrower, creating a tax liability that most qualifying borrowers would be unable to afford. Student loans forgiven under other programs, including Public Service Loan Forgiveness and TEACH Grants, are not treated as taxable income.Earlier this year, President Obama formally widened the pool of eligible participants in the Pay As You Earn Program (PAYE) which will help an estimated additional 5 million people manage their debt. Borrowers who have demonstrated a good faith effort at repaying their loans and are currently underwater deserve a fair shot.Today, the average student graduates with around $29,400 in loans. At private nonprofit colleges, average student debt is around $32,300. Nationally, student debt tops $1.2 trillion.  Given the extent of the student debt crisis, it is essential to give borrowers who have been crushed by student debt for two decades the opportunity to get out from under those loans and further contribute productively to our economy.This legislation has been endorsed by The Institute for College Access and Success (TICAS), Young Invincibles, the Association of State Colleges and Universities, the Council for Opportunity in Education, U.S. PIRG, Equal Justice Works and the American Council for Education.Key Facts:·   There are 1.4 million people enrolled in the Income Based Repayment (IBR) program.·   There are 190,000 people enrolled in Pay as You Earn (PAYE) program which was expanded by Pres. Obama this year.·   Of the $1.2 trillion in student debt, over $1 trillion is owned by the Federal Government.·   Fifty-eight percent of all student debt is held by families in the bottom 25% of household incomes. Additionally, outstanding student loan debt is a 25% share of the same bottom-fifth\\'s income, compared to 12% of the middle-fifth and only 2% of the richest 10% of families.·   Currently, 791,000 borrowers in Wisconsin have outstanding federal loans.·   Currently, 2,238,000 borrowers in Florida have outstanding federal loans.###',\n",

Box 7841Madison, WI 53707-7841Dear Dr. Evers:I am writing in support of the Department of Public Instruction's (DPI) full compliance with the Department of Justice's examination into potentially discriminatory practices occurring within the Wisconsin Parental Choice Program.Throughout its tenure, the Wisconsin Parental Choice Program has elicited serious complaints regarding discrimination against students with disabilities, but recent allegations are especially egregious. I have closely followed reports that the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program discriminates against students with disabilities during the admissions process. Allegations made by families, Disability Rights Wisconsin, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin assert that private schools participating in the voucher program have instituted policies which create barriers for students with disabilities and intentionally block them from school admission. Additionally, concerns have been raised that some students with disabilities have been expelled or forced to leave voucher funded schools as a result of school policies that do not accommodate their needs.According to the Milwaukee Sentinel Journal, in 2011, of the nearly 21,000 students attending private schools using a state-subsidized voucher 1.6% of students have an individual education plan identifying them as in need of special education services. This figure is especially alarming when considering that nearly 20% of the students in Milwaukee Public Schools have special education plans in place. I encourage DPI's full and fair compliance with the Department of Justice's examination into this important issue. I am deeply troubled by these allegations and sincerely hope that DPI and the Department of Justice will work to ensure that the rights of students with disabilities are upheld.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), U.S. Rep. Scott Peters (CA-52), along with 21 House Democrats, today introduced H.R. 4622: Federal Student Loan Refinancing Act.  The Federal Student Loan Refinancing Act would call on the Secretary of Education to automatically lower all federal student loans to 4 percent – which is near the current 30-year mortgage rate. Refinancing allows the borrower to replace his or her existing debt with a new loan at a lower interest rate. This means that borrowers will reduce the cost of their debt and free up income for purchases that will create a ripple effect on the economy.  The bill introduced today is the House companion to S. 1066 which was introduced by New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand in the U.S. Senate.\"Two-thirds of Americans now leave college weighed down by massive student loan debt, unable to achieve their dreams and contribute to the growth of the economy,\" Pocan said. \"Our bill will allow nearly 40 million Americans to refinance their student loans, just like you can refinance a house or car loan, freeing up funds to buy a house, get a new car, support a family, and pursue greater economic opportunities. Congress should be doing all that it can to make a college education as affordable and accessible as possible.\" \"While there are many steps that need to be taken in order to increase college affordability, this bill addresses an issue that will help 90% of consumers with existing student loan debt,\" Pocan continued.  \"This important legislation will respond to the immediate need for relief from the student loan crisis.\"\"Affordable higher education for lower and middle class families has been central to the American story, including my own,\" Rep. Peters said. \"I would not have been able to attend college without student loans and work study programs. We should be making it easier and more affordable for students to get a college education, not keeping it financially out of reach for middle class families. We need to educate our kids to be competitive in the global economy; it\\'s an investment in our economic future, and an investment in American families.\"Peters continued, \"Students and families across San Diego would save thousands of dollars under this legislation, giving them greater flexibility when they graduate, and providing some necessary, and welcome, relief to those struggling to advance themselves.\"\"I am proud to stand with Rep. Pocan and Rep. Peters, and their cosponsors, to address the crushing amount of student debt facing our graduates and their families,\" said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. \"It is clear that higher education is the clearest path to the middle class, yet there is now over one trillion dollars in outstanding student loans, many with outrageously high interest rates. As a result, instead of starting businesses and families or buying homes and cars, these graduates and families need decades to pay off their debt. There is a solution is right in front of us - allow our graduates to refinance their debt in the same way that our businesses and homeowners do. Providing this common sense solution will strengthen the middle class and grow our economy. We cannot afford any more delay. \"BACKGROUNDAccording to original research by One Wisconsin Institute, the student loan debt crisis has been shown to be a huge drag not just on borrowers\\' household budgets, but the entire state economy, reducing new car purchasing by over $200 million annually and leaving middle class households with student loan debt more likely to rent than own a home.In Wisconsin, the average student graduates from college owing $22,460 in student loans.  Nearly 800,000 individuals in Wisconsin currently have outstanding student loans. By allowing the average borrower to refinance their loans at 4%, they would be saving $8,483 over the 20 year life of the loan.In California, 13.7% of consumers have student debt, owing an average of $25,650 in student loans.  Furthermore, 11.9% of all California borrowers have defaulted on their Federal loans between 2009 and 2012. Currently, nearly 4 million borrowers in California have outstanding Federal loans. By allowing the average borrower to refinance to 4% they would be saving $9,668.15 over the 20 year life of the loan.Congressman Pocan represents the 2nd Congressional District of Wisconsin which includes the state\\'s largest university – the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  As a member of the Education and Workforce Committee, Congressman Pocan has been especially focused on college affordability issues affecting working class families. Congressman Pocan has worked very closely on student loan refinancing policies.In the fall of 2013, Congressman Pocan introduced a bill that would allow borrowers to refinance their loans whenever lower rates become available. Rep. Pocan is also an original cosponsor of the Bank on Students Emergency Refinancing Act which was introduced in the House by Representatives Tierney and Miller and in the Senate by Elizabeth Warren. This legislation further underscores the importance of allowing borrowers to refinance their loans by including refinancing options for both public and private loans.###',\n",

The new initiatives, which are focused on increasing college accessibility for low-income students, will be announced today in Washington, D.C., by UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank at a White House Summit on college opportunity.“With a college degree now more important than ever to securing a quality job, we must guarantee that the doors to higher education are open to all of our students, regardless of economic status,” Pocan said. “I applaud Chancellor Blank and UW-Madison for recognizing the issues at hand and committing to new initiatives that will help ensure all qualified students in Wisconsin can access the excellent education the university provides.”In addition to building on current efforts, UW-Madison will expand its premier pipeline programs, including the Pre-college Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence (PEOPLE) program that reaches low-income students across the state of Wisconsin. The PEOPLE program provides pre-college programming, including career and college advice, and financial aid information, and presently involves nearly 900 pre-college students and over 350 matriculated college students. UW-Madison will also establish an Institute for Science Education (ISE), which would work with K-12 schools on programming to increase student interest in pursuing STEM degree programs, targeting schools serving low-income students.  The ISE also would work closely with first and second year students to provide mentoring regarding careers in STEM, complementing existing STEM initiatives on campus such as the Women in Science and Engineering Learning Community.UW-Madison will also improve financial aid advising to prospective low-income students and enrolled students, through increased staffing and increased financial aid for lower-income students through a new capital campaign.A full list of the university’s commitments can be found here.',\n",

The important committee has jurisdiction over education (early childhood, K-12, and higher education), job training programs, workforce protections, and employment-related benefits including healthcare and pensions.   The appointment is effective immediately.“The key to our nation’s economic prosperity lies in our robust support for education and our workforce, and I am honored to fight for these pressing priorities as a member of the Education & the Workforce Committee,” Pocan said. “From preserving access to a high quality college education, to strengthening job training programs, to protecting our workers, I will use my position on this important committee to advocate for the vital interests of our working families and students in south central Wisconsin.”“The Education and Workforce Committee will be well-served by the talent of Congressman Mark Pocan,” said House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.  “A proven problem-solver with a staunch commitment to working families, he will continue to promote polices that create jobs, strengthen the middle class, and ensure a more prosperous future for all.  From his constituents in Wisconsin to his colleagues in Washington, Congressman Pocan’s leadership is respected and valued.”    “I am very pleased to welcome Rep. Pocan to the Education and the Workforce Committee. Mark has been a strong advocate on behalf of working families and our nation’s students,” said Rep. George Miller, the Ranking Member and senior Democrat on the committee. “As a union member and owner of a union printing shop, Rep. Pocan will have unique insight into the struggles of workers who are fighting for a piece of the American Dream. I welcome Mark’s voice to the committee and his determination to grow and strengthen the nation’s middle class.”Since arriving in Congress, Pocan, a union member and owner of a union specialty printing shop, has been a vigorous advocate for working families in Wisconsin and across the nation. He has supported an increase to the minimum wage, fought for a full NLRB board to enforce workplace laws, and backed increased funding for workplace and job training programs that prepare our workers for the jobs of today and the future. He has also taken a lead on the issue of college affordability, introducing legislation that would allow nearly 40 million Americans to refinance their federal student loans to the lowest current interest rate. Pocan also believes every student deserves to attend a safe school environment that is free from bullying and harassment, and earlier this year co-sponsored the bipartisan Student Non-Discrimination Act which would prohibit at the federal level discrimination in public schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity Rep. Tom Petri (WI-06) is the only other member of the Wisconsin delegation to serve on the committee.###',\n",

       "  'date': 'September 5, 2013',\n",
       "  'text': \"MADISON, WI—As students across south central Wisconsin arrive on campus for a new school year, they return with a higher likelihood than ever before of graduating tens of thousands of dollars in debt. In response to the student debt crisis that is pricing students out of a college education and crippling our economy, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today introduced student loan refinancing legislation on the UW-Madison campus to help make college more affordable. Pocan’s bill, H.R. 3047, would allow anyone with a federal student loan to refinance so they are paying the lowest interest rate available for their respective loans.“Instead of relying on college graduates to bankroll Washington’s needs, the federal government should be doing all that it can to make a college education as affordable and accessible as possible,” Pocan said. “Two-thirds of Americans now leave college drowning in debt, unable to achieve their dreams or contribute to the economy in a meaningful way. My bill will allow nearly 40 million Americans to refinance their student loans, just like you can refinance a house or car loan, freeing up funds to buy a house, get a new car, support a family, and pursue greater economic opportunities.” Today, 83 percent of the more than $1.2 trillion in total student debt in this country is from federal student loans, but students face limited options to refinance their federal loans once they have graduated from college. Pocan’s legislation would remove the current restrictions, allowing anyone with a subsidized or unsubsidized federal Stafford loan, or a federal direct PLUS loan, to refinance their interest rate whenever the borrowing rates are reduced.According to the New York Federal Reserve, total student debt has tripled over the past eight years, and now exceeds all credit card debt in this country. The average student debt held by the class of 2011 in Wisconsin is more than $26,000, with 67 percent of students graduating in debt. A study from One Wisconsin Now found it will take Wisconsinites, on average, almost 19 years to pay off their student loan debt from a four-year university. Money used to pay off the high interest rates on student loans is money that instead could be spent on major purchases such as a home or a new car.“A strong economy demands an educated workforce and a robust middle class, and students are taking responsibility for paying for their education and job training,” said One Wisconsin Now Executive Director Scot Ross. “Congressman Pocan's plans to help hardworking borrowers get a fair shot at the middle class instead of a multi-decade student loan debt sentence are the kind of common sense solutions we need to fix the trillion dollar student loan debt crisis.” H.R.3047 has been referred to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.###\",\n",

       "  'text': \"WASHINGTON—One week after student loan rates doubled from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent for nearly 160,000 Wisconsin students, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) once again urged GOP leadership to stop balancing the budget on the backs of students and bring up a vote to freeze student loan rates. Last month, Pocan joined his colleagues in signing a discharge petition to bring up for a vote the Student Loan Relief Act of 2013, which would freeze the interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans for the next two years.Today, every Democrat in the Wisconsin State Assembly sent a letter to the Wisconsin Congressional delegation urging Congress to roll back the interest rates.“Our education leaders, our students and parents, and now our local representatives in Wisconsin are all in unison: stop the student loan rates from doubling,” Pocan said. “Unfortunately, these calls seem to be falling on the deaf ears of the House Republican leadership, which has thus far only offered a “solution” that would end up costing students even more than if these loan rates stay at the doubled cost. A quality, accessible college education is too important to our country’s long-term economic vitality to fall victim to partisan inaction. Wisconsinites are known for their commonsense, and I am ready to work with our delegation and the entire Congress to fight to avert these unnecessary and harmful measures.”While Pocan and his Democratic colleagues are seeking to freeze student loan interest rates, House Republicans pushed through a bill in May that would tie the interest rate to the 10-year Treasury note (T-Note), leaving the cost of students' college education in the hands of Wall Street. In fact, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the projected rate by the time incoming freshman start re-paying their loans four years later would be 7.4 percent--higher than if Congress leaves the rates at 6.8 percent. At the end of the day, the GOP plan would mean more than 7 million low–and middle-income students would have to pay more for their student loans, and would increase student loan debt by almost $4 billion over the next decade.The drastically increasing student loan debt held by Americans across the country can be considered nothing less than a crisis. Total student debt has tripled over the past eight years and now tops $1 trillion, exceeding all credit card debt in this country. The average student debt held by the class of 2011 in the United States is more than $26,000. And according to a study from One Wisconsin, it will take Wisconsinites on average almost 19 years to pay off their student loan debt from a four-year university, taking away money that could be spent in our local economies.\",\n",

Pocan joined his colleagues in signing a discharge petition to bring up for a vote the Student Loan Relief Act of 2013, which would freeze the interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans for the next two years. If Congress does not act, on July 1 the interest rates on these loans will double from 3.4% to 6.8%--costing students about $1,000 more per year on average. “If Congress can find the time to vote 37 times on fruitless attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, surely we can find time to support our students striving to advance themselves through higher education,” Pocan said. “At a time when a college degree is more important than ever to obtaining reliable employment, we are in grave danger of pricing too many of our young students out of a college education. Instead of trying to balance our budget on the backs of our students, we need to be increasing opportunities to pursue college diplomas. I urge my Republican colleagues to work with us and freeze these student loan rates before it is too late.”The drastically increasing student loan debt held by Americans across the country can be considered nothing less than a crisis.

The Student Loan Relief Act, which is cosponsored by Pocan along with more than 150 other members,  was introduced by Rep. Joe Courtney (D-CT) on April 17, 2013, but Republicans have failed to schedule a hearing or a mark-up on the bill.

Mark Pocan (WI-02) today voted against Republican legislation that would cost students and families almost $4 billion in additional student loan interest fees, and called on Congress to take action immediately to prevent student loan interest rates from doubling. If Congress does not act, on July 1st interest rates on federal subsidized Stafford Loans will double, from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent, for 7 million low-and middle-income students.Video of Pocan on the House floor talking about the urgent need to deal with our student loan debt crisis is available here.“This past weekend, 6,200 students graduated from UW-Madison with a college degree and unprecedented levels of student loan debt. Total college loan debt now tops $1 trillion nationally, and too many Wisconsinites are trapped in endless debt that is preventing them from contributing to the economy and achieving the American Dream,” Pocan said. “We need a long-term solution to our student loan debt crisis, but we must take action right now to support our students by preventing interest rates from doubling. Unfortunately, today we voted on legislation that tries to pay down our debt on the backs of our students, making college more expensive to the tune of almost $4 billion over 10 years. A college education is key to increased economic opportunity, and we should be supporting, not deterring, those who strive to pursue higher education.”If the Republican plan, H.R. 1911, became law, the interest rate for incoming freshmen next year would be 4.4 percent, up from 3.4 percent. However, the rate for subsequent years would be tied to the 10-year Treasury note (T-Note), and would vary throughout the life of the loan, leaving the cost of students' college education in the hands of Wall Street.In fact, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the projected rate by the time these students start re-paying their loans four years later would be 7.4%--higher than if Congress did nothing and left the rates at 6.8 percent.

According to research from the Institute for One Wisconsin, Wisconsinites with a bachelor’s or advanced degree make average student loan payments of $388 a month, money they owe before they start to pay for their rent, car payments, groceries, or child care. Due to the burdens of student loan debt, Wisconsinites are renting instead of buying houses, and purchasing used vehicles over new ones—costing Wisconsin more than $200 million annually in lost new car purchases.###\",\n",

Instead, he and his Republican colleagues chose to engage in hostage-taking, refusing to raise the debt ceiling to avoid default unless paired with devastating cuts to essential government programs. While I am relieved the President and Democratic Leadership were able to walk back the worst of the Republicans’ demands, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I was unable to support this final agreement due to remaining unanswered questions.“This bill critically undercuts the appropriations process, one of the last processes in Washington where Democrats and Republicans work together. Severely restraining domestic spending while continuing to inflate unchecked defense spending for the Pentagon shows Republicans are not actually serious about addressing the deficit.\\xa0“With too many unanswered questions and unknown, undisclosed side deals, including a shortfall of $58 billion in promised domestic funding not explicitly guaranteed in the language of the bill for things like education, healthcare, and more, I could not, in good conscience, vote for this bill.\\xa0“In addition to my serious concerns about the impacts to the appropriations process and backroom deals, this bill expands SNAP work requirements for older Americans and threatens cash assistance for the lowest-income families, while simultaneously rescinding critical IRS investments intended to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. Moreover, this bill weakens key environmental and climate protections.\\xa0“While I am relieved that we will avoid an economic default, I remain steadfast that we never should have had to engage with an extreme MAGA Republican dominated caucus in hostage negotiations over Americans’ livelihoods to begin with. Looking forward, we should eliminate the unnecessary debt ceiling to avoid any question of the full faith and credit of the United States.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.— Today, U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the Congressional PFAS Task Force, voted to protect Wisconsin families from exposure to dangerous PFAS chemicals with H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act.  This legislation seeks to address \"forever chemicals,\" which pose a direct threat to public health, and implement stronger protections against future pollution.\"In Madison, Wisconsin, PFAS chemicals have been discovered in every single one of our city wells. Fifty other cities across the state have also found the same chemicals in their water,\" Congressman Mark Pocan said. \"For far too long we have allowed these toxic chemicals that have been linked to cancer, infertility, and more to pollute our air, land, and water. That\\'s why I proudly voted for the PFAS Action Act, which will finally ban these toxic forever chemicals from our communities, introduce stricter protections against PFAS pollution, and hold polluters accountable.\"PFAS chemicals represent a serious public health risk to nearly all Americans. The CDC has reported that PFAS is present in nearly every American\\'s blood, exposing countless people to life-threatening illness and disease, including cancer, liver disease, asthma, thyroid dysfunction, infertility, and impaired child development.  A new study using EPA data shows that an estimated 30,000 industrial sites are known or suspected of using toxic PFAS: twelve times what had been previously estimated.  American servicemembers and their families are also at particular risk of exposure, as more than 400 U.S. military sites are known to have PFAS contamination.By passing the PFAS Action Act, the House makes important progress toward cleaning up our communities and holding contaminating companies accountable for their pollution.  This legislation designates the two most studied PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances immediately and sets a deadline for the EPA to make designation decisions about all other PFAS chemicals – which has been a key barrier to cleaning up industrial and military sites.  The bill also creates new grants and partnerships to help states with clean-up and remediation efforts.  To prevent future contamination, the bill introduces stricter limits on PFAS pollution and the introduction of new PFAS chemicals, as well tougher testing, reporting and monitoring requirements.Video of Rep. Pocan addressing the need to pass the PFAS Action Act can be found here.',\n",

Climate change is an enormous threat to our nation and our planet, and the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris is a key opportunity for the global community to agree to a strong framework to combat the crisis. As the administration pushes towards an agreement in Paris, we must not let trade rules, including those incorporated in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) undercut the prospects for or implementation of a strong climate deal.In recent years we have witnessed an alarming rise of international trade and investment disputes related to renewable energy and climate policies. Foreign investors and corporations are increasingly using investment rules in free trade agreements and bilateral investment treaties to challenge climate and clean energy policies. Recently there has been a significant increase in investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) cases in which corporations bring legal action against governments with policies contradicting the parameters of a trade agreement. In fact, since 2011 the number of ISDS cases, which often target environmental regulations and standards, has exploded to an average of nearly fifty cases each year.In order to combat the climate crisis every nation will need to transition to a new, low carbon future. There are many ways this can be accomplished, but countries and localities will need flexibility to realize this goal. All countries should be incentivized to implement policies to combat climate change. For this reason, we cannot adopt trade rules, which empower foreign investors to challenge state and federal renewable energy programs.  The Paris climate deal and free trade agreements cannot be discussed in silos. Further, the United States must not perpetuate the ability of foreign companies to undermine sovereign governments\\' efforts to combat climate change. We urge the administration to ensure no provisions within any trade agreement under consideration by the United States undermine the ability of countries to reach or implement a strong agreement to address climate change.Sincerely,',\n",

To make matters worse, reports have shown that existing fracking wells on public lands aren\\'t being adequately inspected, creating even more potential for disastrous accidents. Right now, about 90 percent of federally managed lands are available for oil and gas leasing, while only 10 percent are reserved for conservation, recreation, wildlife and cultural heritage.The Protect our Public Lands Act, H.R. 1902prohibits fracking, the use of fracking fluid, and acidization for the extraction of oil and gas on public lands for any lease issued, renewed, or readjusted.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense funding bill to make key investments in clean energy technologies that are critical to current and future military missions. Pocan’s efforts would support research and development to improve the safety of advanced batteries, and specifically lithium ion batteries, required for many of the Navy’s new capabilities. Lithium ion batteries, which contain no toxic chemicals, have up to three times the performance capabilities of other battery products.After securing commitments from committee leadership on the House floor to continue to work on ways to support these vital new technologies, Pocan withdrew his provision. “Investing in clean energy technologies is good environmental policy, good economic policy, and good national security policy,” Pocan said. “Advanced batteries such as those used by the Navy are not only more efficient and powerful, they also produce high quality American jobs, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and improve our abilities to respond to emerging threats,” Pocan said. “By supporting further research into these new advancements, we can ensure these technologies are as safe and effective as possible.”Many of the Navy’s newest systems require the type of increased energy capacities that lithium ion batteries provide. But current lithium-ion batteries can cause violent fires with extreme smoke and high temperatures that are potentially catastrophic, especially on ships. While scientists have advanced new technologies that can greatly increase the safety of these batteries, they require additional research, development and testing. Pocan’s provision would provide the necessary support to promote the development of more effective and safe advanced batteries.',\n",

These measures include expanding access to child care, keeping workers safe, and giving our troops a raise. Any inaction toward this bill could have shut down the government, allowing the GOP leadership to give us a bill that would have been worse, riddled with extreme priorities. House Democrats played the best hand with the cards we were dealt.\\xa0“I’m not supportive of some provisions in this bill, including a delay of additional funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). This is a continuation of the Administration’s current policy toward the agency which must be overturned. I support immediately providing much-needed funding toward the agency and will continue my work to do just that.”\\xa0By passing the bill, Democrats rejected many extreme Republican cuts and policy riders. Instead, this government funding package provides:$1 billion increase for child care and Head Start.$20 million increase for Title I education funding, rejecting Republican efforts to eliminate 224,000 teachers’ jobs.$14 million increase in funding for special education.Protects funding for the maximum Pell Grant at $7,395 per student.\\xa0$1.1 billion for Senior Nutrition Programs, which includes Meals on Wheels.Increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health, including for cancer and Alzheimer’s research.Provides 5.2% pay increase for servicemembers and increases the Basic Allowance for Housing by 5.4%.\\xa0$1 billion increase for climate change and resilience activities.Adds 12,000 more Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who assisted the United States.Includes $29.9 billion to support the reunification of migrant families cruelly separated at the southern border by the Trump administration.Removes numerous Republican policy riders including 10 that would have limited women’s access to reproductive health, 44 that attacked the rights of the LGBTQI+ community, and banned funding for President Biden’s executive orders to address the climate crisis.As a member of the Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for drafting all federal funding legislation, Rep. Pocan looks forward to Wisconsin – and Wisconsin’s 2nd Congressional District – receiving the funding it needs and deserves.This package includes the following funding bills: Defense; Financial Services and General Government; Homeland Security; Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies; Legislative Branch; and State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs.A detailed summary of the legislation is available here.A package containing six other appropriations bills for fiscal year 2024, including all of Rep.

The measure would require this commission to:Report recommendations for a plan of action for the establishment and maintenance of a National Museum of American LGBTQI+ History and Culture;Develop a fundraising plan to support the establishment, operation, and maintenance of the museum through public contributions;Obtain an independent review of this fundraising plan, including an analysis of the resources necessary to fund the construction of the museum and its operations and maintenance without reliance on federal funds;Report on the availability and cost of acquiring collections for the museum, identify potential locations for the facility in Washington, D.C., and determine its regional impact on other museums; and,Submit to Congress a legislative plan of action to establish and construct the museum.The bill would also direct the commission's recommendations to address whether the museum should be part of the Smithsonian Institution, the world’s largest museum and research complex. The commission would have 18 months to complete the full study.After the commission completes its work and issues its recommendations, Congress can consider the second bill to formally create the museum.Chair Pocan was joined by all 8 openly LGBTQI+ Co-Chairs of the Equality Caucus in introducing this legislation, including Representatives Mark Takano (D-CA), Sharice Davids (D-KS), Robert Garcia (D-CA), Becca Balint (D-VT), Ritchie Torres (D-NY), Chris Pappas (D-NH), Angie Craig (D-MN), and Eric Sorensen (D-IL).\",\n",

       "  'date': 'September 22, 2023',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C.\\xa0– Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), and U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (D-WI-02), introduced the\\xa0Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2023\\xa0to help prevent bullying and harassment at colleges and universities around the country. The bill would finally require colleges and universities receiving federal support to establish anti-harassment policies to prohibit harassment based on actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or religion, and it would require schools to recognize “cyberbullying” as a form of harassment.Today marks the anniversary of the death of Tyler Clementi, a freshman at Rutgers University, who tragically lost his life to suicide in 2010 after his roommate and another student invaded his privacy and harassed him over his sexual orientation.“No one should be bullied or harassed because of who they are or who they love,”\\xa0said Representative Pocan.\\xa0“Today we honor Tyler’s life by reintroducing the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act to ensure that students can learn in peace and not have to worry about living in fear or humiliation for being themselves.”“Every student deserves a safe and supportive learning environment—but bullying and harassment on college campuses remains widespread, especially for LGBTQ+ students, and federal law doesn’t currently require schools to adopt comprehensive anti-harassment policies,”\\xa0said Senator Murray.\\xa0“Establishing strong anti-harassment policies will help make sure every student can pursue a higher education free from bullying and discrimination. I’m proud to honor Tyler Clementi’s life by renewing our push to pass this critical legislation.”“No one should live in fear of being bullied just because of who they are, especially in our schools,”\\xa0said Senator Baldwin.\\xa0“In the face of increased harassment and discrimination, particularly against members of the LGBTQ+ community, our legislation makes crystal clear that kind of hate has no place on our college campuses or universities. All students deserve to have the freedom to succeed in a safe and healthy place and pursue their dreams, free of discrimination.”Students across the country continue to face widespread bullying and harassment on college campuses, and LGBTQ+ students are nearly twice as likely to experience harassment in higher education. A report published last year found that\\xa0one-third of LGBTQ+ students\\xa0at four-year colleges were bullied, harassed, or assaulted, and 19% of their non-LGBTQ+ peers were similarly mistreated. This widespread harassment has detrimental effects on student’s wellbeing and educational opportunities. The same 2022 report found that 35% of LGBTQ+ students said their mental health was not good all or most of the time they were in college, and LGBTQ+ youth continue to experience\\xa0a\\xa0significantly higher risk of suicide—with\\xa045%\\xa0of LGBTQ youth seriously considering attempting suicide in the last year.The\\xa0Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act\\xa0would help protect students from campus bullying and harassment and address this widespread issue by:Requiring all colleges and universities receiving federal aid to prohibit the harassment of enrolled students based on their actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or religion;Requiring schools to distribute their anti-harassment policy to all students and employees, including prospective students and employees, upon request.Requiring schools to recognize “cyberbullying” as a form of harassment; andCreating a grant program to help colleges and universities start or expand programs to prevent harassment and provide counseling services to students who have experienced harassment.“We are grateful to all those who keep working to improve school environments by making them kinder, safer, and more inclusive than what Tyler experienced while attending an institution of higher education,”\\xa0said Jane Clementi, Tyler Clementi’s mother and Co-Founder and CEO of the Tyler Clementi Foundation.\\xa0“Special thanks to Congressman Pocan and Senators Murray and Baldwin for reintroducing the\\xa0Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act. We fully support this legislation because we believe all institutions of higher education should have policies to keep all their students safe. After all, every student deserves a positive educational experience free of harassment, bullying or humiliation in an inclusive learning environment where they can study, grow, and thrive regardless of their race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or whatever else makes them special and precious; and every parent should have peace of mind that their children will be protected and free of harm while in the school’s care.”“College is hard enough without the added layer of harassment and cyberbullying that so many LGBTQ+ students experience,”\\xa0said Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson.\\xa0“The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act would set the tone that harassment on campus is not going to be tolerated, and it would provide a layer of protection for vulnerable students, including LGBTQ+ students. We thank Senators Patty Murray and Tammy Baldwin and Congressman Mark Pocan for introducing this important piece of legislation.”“Harassment and bullying are far too common on college campuses, which is why the National Women’s Law Center strongly supports this legislation to help ensure that all students feel safe at their college or university,”\\xa0said Shiwali Patel, Director of Justice for Student Survivors & Senior Counsel at the National Women’s Law Center.\\xa0“It is long past time that institutions of higher learning have the resources that they need to root out this awful discrimination, and I am grateful to Senator Murray, Senator Baldwin, and Representative Pocan for their leadership in reintroducing this important bill.”26 Senators joined Senators Murray and Baldwin in introducing the legislation today, including: Senators Blumenthal, Booker, Brown, Cardin, Casey, Duckworth, Feinstein, Fetterman, Gillibrand, Hassan, Hirono, Kaine, Klobuchar, Luján, Markey, Menendez, Merkley, Padilla, Sanders, Schatz, Shaheen, Smith, Van Hollen, Warren, Whitehouse, and Wyden.\\xa041 Representatives joined Representative Pocan in introducing the legislation today, including: Representatives Bonamici, Brownley, Carbajal, Casten, Castor, Davids, Danny Davis, DelBene, Doggett, Espaillat, Garamendi, Keating, Khanna, Kilmer, Kuster, Summer Lee, McCollum, Meng, Moore, Morelle, Moulton, Nadler, Panetta, Pappas, Peters, Pingree, Quigley, Raskin, Sánchez, Scanlon, Schakowsky, Schiff, Sherrill, Adam Smith, Stansbury, Swalwell, Takano, Tonko, Ritchie Torres, Wasserman Schultz, and Watson Coleman.\\xa0The\\xa0Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2023\\xa0is endorsed by: the Tyler Clementi Foundation, the American College Health Association, the American Association of University Women (AAUW), the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, GLSEN, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, the National Women’s Law Center (NWLC), and The Trevor Project.A one-pager on the legislation is available\\xa0HERE.

The five Water Defenders began to speak out against these steps last year, and in January 2023, were suddenly arrested and charged with a decades-old alleged crime. The Salvadoran Attorney General’s Office requested and obtained complete secrecy for the proceedings.

The Words Matter Act will modernize our laws, and remove offensive language from the U.S. Code. I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for joining this effort to update our laws in a manner that is respectful of every American. I look forward to this bill\\'s immediate passage so we can retire this language once and for all.\"\"I am the proud father of a Down syndrome young adult and Eagle Scout,\" Congressman Sessions said. \"Those who know my son regard him as an able, loving, and accomplished young man, whose abilities far outnumber his disabilities. I am confident that the ‘Words Matter Act\\' will bring us one step closer to ushering our U.S. Code into the present. While this change is long past due, I am pleased to be a lead co-sponsor of this bi-partisan legislation which amends dated language to ‘intellectual disability\\' for federal laws. Those with Down syndrome are a blessing from God and deserve to be respected as such.\"\"My oldest son Cole has Down syndrome. From the day he was born, I watched as others tried to limit his potential. But Cole has refused to let his extra 21st chromosome define him, defying his doubters at every turn,\" said Congresswoman Rodgers. \"In America, we are not defined by the condition of our birth, and it\\'s well-past time the text of our nation\\'s laws reflect that. The use of outdated and derogatory language in previously written law fails to treat individuals with disabilities with the dignity and respect they deserve. I\\'m confident the Words Matter Act will prove that our country knows better by bringing the laws of our land into the 21st century and setting a new standard for the way we speak about others in America.\"\"Words indisputably matter, and I\\'m proud to be a lead cosponsor of Rep.

       "  'text': \"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressional Equality Caucus Chair U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) held a press conference today on the radical anti-LGBTQI+ agenda House Republicans are moving in the Education and the Workforce Committee, with a focus on the proposed national trans and intersex sports ban being considered by the committee this week.Shiwali Patel, the Director of Justice for Student Survivors & Senior Counsel at the National Women's Law Center, Rebekah Bruesehoff, a transgender student athlete, and Jamie Bruesehoff, a parent and advocate joined Chair Pocan for the press conference.Click here to watch the full press conference and find the transcript of all the speakers' remarks below.Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), Congressional Equality Caucus ChairToday Republicans are showing their real priorities, political priorities, by considering a trans and intersex sports ban as the opening salvo in their efforts to undermine the rights of LGBTQI+ people. Young people participate in sports, to be part of a team to learn sportsmanship and to challenge themselves. Their sports ban seeks to strip trans girls of all ages and intersex students of these opportunities. Look, there are real pressing problems impacting women's and girls' sports, including sexual harassment and assault, lack of equal resources and pay inequality. And there are pressing problems facing the kids of our nation including nearly 50,000 gun deaths a year including more than 4,700 involving kids. But rather than addressing any of those issues, anti-equality politicians on the Education and Workforce Committee will spend their first legislative markup targeting a handful of trans girls and women who participate in school sports.When it comes to protecting women's sports, we should look to leading women's sports and gender justice organizations like Women's Sports Foundation, and the National Women's Law Center. Both organizations, as well as leading women athletes, support transgender inclusion in sports. Major athletic bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, and the NCAA have guidelines for the participation of transgender athletes. And those bodies reject the type of systematic exclusion of transgender people from sports that anti-LGBTQI+ politicians are pushing. This is part of a larger, coordinated attack against transgender people and the larger gay community.We've seen hundreds of anti-equality bills, with many specifically targeting transgender people introduced in states across the country this year. Unfortunately, this is about building the personal brand of some extreme right-wing politicians; people who fundraise from an appeal to a small subset of their political base. These bullying politicians will endanger the lives of trans kids for their own political purposes with the support of the GOP leadership. But I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Not one person in Republican leadership called out the comments by a conservative speaker at CPAC last week who called for the eradication of transgender people. Look, this isn't about sports. This is about attacking trans and other LGBTQI plus kids, and the politics of the issue, not the substance of letting kids play. And that's heartless, and cruel, and very wrong.There will be few pages assigned to future chapters of Profiles in Courage for the politicians that bully kids for their own gain. And that's exactly what this is about today. We are really pleased to be joined by a few folks who are going to offer some really strong expertise and talking about this. In just a minute you're going to hear from Shiwali Patel, who's the Senior Counsel at the National Women's Law Center, you're going to hear from a student athlete, Rebekah Bruesehoff. And you're going to hear from her mother, Jamie, who are going to talk about how this impacts real families, as unfortunately too many extreme MAGA politicians are busy lining their campaign coffers and appealing to a political base. So with that, I'd like to introduce Shewali Patel from the National Women's Law Center.Shewali Patel, Director of Justice for Student Survivors & Senior Counsel at the National Women's Law CenterThank you, I'm Shewali Patel, a Title IX civil rights attorney at the National Women's Law Center, where I work every day to ensure that women's and girls' civil rights are strongly protected in schools. And I'm honored to be here alongside Rebekah and her mother Jamie and Chair Pocan to express the Law Center's strong opposition to efforts to ban transgender women and girls from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity. These efforts seek to deny trans athletes access to the many benefits; to emotional, social, and physical and academic wellbeing that participation in sports offer.Transphobic laws and policies turn Title IX and the critical protections it offers against sex discrimination and education on its head. The Law Center was founded the same year the Title IX was enacted just over 50 years ago, and since then, we have been fighting against sex discrimination in education, including in school sports. And today we're paying close attention to the attacks against transgender, nonbinary and intersex students through hateful federal and state legislation, including the GOP's bill H.R. 734, which is about to go into markup.While this bill is framed as protecting women's and girls' sports, we know what it really is. It's a bigoted and discriminatory attempt to target an already marginalized group, rather than address real barriers to gender equity and sports. This bill and other bills across the country like it are intentionally misleading when invoking women and girls' rights because they really seek to exclude trans women and girls from sports. It's also very telling that these bills are pushed by groups who haven't actually fought to protect women's and girls' rights in sports and elsewhere. There are actual well-documented barriers to athletics that women and girls face, including less funded and resourced teams, inadequate facilities and equipment. unequal pay for women's athletes and coaches, and rampant sexual abuse of student athletes. But these bills and H.R. 734 doesn't address those issues. And yet proponents of these sports bans continue to and wrongly claim that allowing trans athletes to compete will harm cisgender women and girls, but this divide and conquer tactic gets it exactly wrong.Excluding women and girls who are trans hurts us all. It invites gender policing that could subject any women or girl to invasive medical test, and accusations of being too masculine or too good at their sport to be real women or girls. It subjects athletes to humiliating practices to determine their sex and makes them vulnerable to sexual abuse by being forced into sex verification procedures that may include gynecological exams or other procedures. It harms women and girls who fall outside of stereotypical notions of femininity, and especially black and brown women and girls, given racist standards of what is considered feminine. As a national women's rights organization, we have always been clear that transgender girls are girls who should have the right to participate in athletics and other school programs and activities consistent with their gender identity.Trans and intersex girls and women have been playing school sports for many years, and yet they have not been dominating their peers. There's no evidence of it. In fact, allowing trans athletes to participate in sports correlates with increased participation by all girls. But in states that enacted trans exclusionary policies in sports, girls' overall participation in high school sports actually declined. And despite all this fear mongering from extremist lawmakers, boys are not pretending to be girls to dominate in school sports that just isn't happening. Yet unfortunately, politicians acting in bad faith are using trans women and girls as political pawns to perpetuate their hateful agenda.The truth is like any other girl or woman, sometimes trans women and girls lose at their game, and sometimes they win. And when they win, we celebrate, and we will continue to celebrate their wins. Banning certain students from sports merely because of who they are doesn't promote fairness, or safety for women and girls. But H.R. 734 would mandate discriminatory exclusion for every age, every sport and level of competition gatekeeping which women and girls get a chance to play and clearly violating Title IX's mandate of equal educational opportunity. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.Rebekah Bruesehoff, Trans Student Athlete and ActivistHi, my name is Rebekah. I'm a 16-year-old high school sophomore who actually loves school. I'm a straight A Honors student. I have a solo in the spring musical. French toast is my favorite food. I'm a pastor's kid and a big sister to two brothers who can be really annoying sometimes, and I still love them. I also happen to be transgender. I've been living as my authentic self for eight years. That's over half my life. I started playing field hockey when I was 10 years old, and I fell in love. It's fun, full of speed and excitement and getting to hit a ball with a stick. Who doesn't love that? But seriously, it's one of the hardest and most rewarding things I do.Field Hockey gives me so much – confidence, strength, and a place to belong. For me, it's not just my sport, it's my community. Through field hockey, I learned how hard work and perseverance can help you make a real-time difference. That translates to everything I do in life. I've had incredible coaches and wonderful teammates. There's never been a question of whether I belonged, whether it's on or off the field. We take care of each other.I should be in chemistry class right now. But I'm here to tell you that kids like me should get to play sports with their friends. Honestly, that feels super absurd when I say it out loud yet, that's what's happening here. Either been speaking out about the right of kids like me to play sports for over two years, I've watched with my friends and other states have had t their right to play debated and legislated. But I live in New Jersey. I live in New Jersey, where I thought I was safe, where everyone said I was safe. I don't understand why lawmakers insist on bullying kids who just want to play.Sports are one of the most American experiences in any childhood, a federal sports ban would alienate me from my community, and prevent me from continuing to become a better version of myself. It would limit access to essential life skills that we want all kids to have, like grit, determination, and learning to work with others towards a common goal. I've been raised and taught by my parents, coaches, and teachers to be the kind of person who works actively to include people. Make sure no one eats alone in the lunchroom, and who stands up to bullies. That's what I'm doing here.Trans kids are a part of every community across the country. We aren't going anywhere; we will keep standing up together. And we all deserve a chance to be kids and to play.Jamie Bruesehoff, Parent & AdvocateMy name is Jamie Bruesehoff and my husband Chris here and I are the proud parents of three children, including Rebecca. There are many things that make Rebecca special; her smile, her laugh, the way she cares deeply about the world. Being transgender is the least remarkable thing about her.\\tAnd as a family of faith, we believe that God created her to be exactly who she is. When I think about what I want for my children, it's what most parents want. I want them to grow into functioning adults who positively contribute to society, are active in their community, and experience joy. I want them to learn how to fall down and get back up to take care of each other and the people around them.Sports, unlike anything else, teaches them how to do those things. That's why parents all over the country commit to getting our kids to practice; washing uniforms, cutting up orange slices, and sitting all day in the bleachers where we're either freezing or getting sunburned. We all do it because we know getting to play the game they love makes our kids not just better teammates, but better human beings. But when I'm watching Rebecca play, I'm not just holding my breath hoping her team makes the next goal. I'm wondering when what's happening to kids in Texas is going to happen to Rebecca and our family.To be categorically excluded from being a full member of her school community in this way would impact every part of her life and separate her not just from her peers, but the coaches and mentors helping her grow into the best version of herself. The idea that lawmakers would spend more time debating whether our daughter gets to play with her friends than they would protecting her from school shootings and gun violence is outrageous. Plenty of things would make school safer for youth and allow all kids a better educational experience. Keeping trans youth for and playing with their peers is not one of them.Hundreds of thousands of families like mine are simply raising our children, like all families. And yet we find ourselves here defending our children from a radical political agenda that we've seen in state houses across America, and now making its way into Congress.Politicians are trying to control how Chris and I parent, to legislate how we raise our kids. The terroristic nature of this kind of legislation impacts our families every day. They are censoring and surveilling our homes, our classrooms, and our doctor's offices. This isn't just about sports and trans kids. This is an attempt to dictate what an American family looks like. And American families can and do look like mine. All kids deserve a chance to be kids and to grow into thriving adults they are meant to be.\",\n",

Today, we\\'ve taken one more step toward guaranteed equal protection under the law, and I thank Senator Baldwin for her support in assisting its passage through the Senate.\" 18 U.S.C. 879 makes it a criminal act to threaten to kill, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm upon the President, a former President, a candidate for President, or a member of their family, while referring to Presidents as men and to their spouses as wives. \\u200b\\u200bThe bipartisan 21st Century President Act would replace the terms \"wife\" and \"widow\" with \"spouse,\" and replaces gender-specific pronouns referring to the President and presidential spouses with gender-neutral terms to extend full protection to anyone elected to become the president and first family.Click here to read the full text of the legislation.',\n",

       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI—As the nation mourns the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless other Black Americans at the hands of police violence, Congressman Mark Pocan (D-WI) is introducing the Police Training and Accountability Act. The bill would establish a national training standard for all law enforcement officers and a Civilian-Law Enforcement Bill of Rights for anyone having contact with law enforcement. A civilian commission would be named to set standards of training for police, to bridge the wide gaps of what training for law enforcement looks like nationwide. The act would require federal funding to police departments to be contingent on these standards being met. \"The police violence we\\'ve seen in the past month is tolerated long before it is called out, and the people of this country are fed up with systemic racial injustice constantly being met with inaction,\" said Congressman Pocan. \"Everyone needs to believe that all law enforcement officers have met national standardized requirements for training and civilian interaction. Federal dollars should not go to police that communities simply do not trust. From de-escalation to use of lethal force, police nationwide must meet new standards before they receive additional funding from the federal government.\"The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (Byrne JAG), is the largest source of federal funds for state and local law enforcement agencies—$547.2 million were appropriated for the program in FY2020. The Police Accountability and Funding Act would require those federal funds to be conditional on police departments meeting the training requirement and standards created by a civilian commission. Those requirements must include, at minimum, standards for: a minimum level of education attainment and training hours, use of force, use of lethal force, implicit bias, conflict resolution, mediation, and de-escalation practices, pursuit, video technology, stop and search procedures, and intervention programs.The bill would also require police departments to adhere to a Civilian-Law Enforcement Bill of Rights prior to receiving any Byrne JAG funding.\"Communities should not only understand what to expect from interactions with law enforcement, but they should have a voice in setting those expectations,\" continued Pocan. \"A Civilian-Law Enforcement Bill of Rights lays out national standards and expectations for anyone in contact with law enforcement, no matter where they live in our country. We need equal enforcement of the law for everyone.\"\"From Florida to Washington, Maine to California, there should be a common standard for law enforcement. We cannot continue to fund new initiatives for police departments to improve while the same systemic problems continue,\" said Pocan. \"Police departments nationwide must use existing funds to meet these new standards. Law enforcement must be held accountable to the standards of the community they are tasked to serve and protect. Anything less is a continuation of injustice.\"See the full text of the bill here.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (May 15, 2019) – Today, U.S. Reprsentative Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02), Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), and Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) re-introduced legislation aimed at reducing bullying and harassment, including cyberbullying, at colleges and universities around the country. The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act of 2019 would require institutions of higher education to establish policies to prohibit harassment based on actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), disability, or religion. The bill also establishes a grant program to support campus anti-harassment activities and programs.The legislation is named after Tyler Clementi, a freshman at Rutgers University, who died by suicide after his roommate and another student invaded his privacy and harassed him over the internet. One in five college students are victims of cyberbullying, and LGBTQ students are nearly twice as likely to experience harassment as their peers.\"No student should be harassed or cyberbullied for who they are, or who they love,\" said Rep. Pocan. \"Bullying is a real and persistent danger for many LGBTQ students at our colleges and universities, but there is no federal legislation that specifically protects students from being targeted based on sexual orientation or gender identity. And more than two years into Donald Trump\\'s presidency, the Administration has worked to strip the rights of LGBTQ students as it rolled back regulations on equality at the Department of Education and directed the Department of Justice to file amicus briefs in support of discriminatory policies. With the White House\\'s refusal to act, we must take a strong stance to ensure that all students are protected. That\\'s why the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act is so important, as it ensures that institutions of higher learning are a place of open expression, which celebrate diversity and embrace students from all different backgrounds.\"\"No student should have to put their wellbeing, their safety, or their life in jeopardy just to access an education, but sadly we\\'re seeing students around the country take drastic measures because of bullying and harassment,\" said Senator Murray. \"In introducing this legislation, I\\'m calling on colleges and universities to step up and start taking responsibility for students\\' safety, and I\\'m so thankful for the support and partnership of advocates like Jane Clementi—who is fighting to ensure every student—no matter who they are, what they believe, or who they love—can pursue higher education free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying.\"\"No student should have to live in fear of being who they are. Our schools should not be, and cannot be, places of discrimination, harassment, bullying, intimidation or violence,\" said Senator Baldwin. \"This legislation, named in honor of Tyler Clementi, is an important step forward in not only preventing harassment on campus, but also making sure our students have the freedom to succeed in safe and healthy communities of learning and achievement. Everyone at colleges and universities across America should be able to pursue their dreams free of harassment and bullying.\"\"We are grateful to Congressman Pocan and Senator Murray for reintroducing the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act, and fully support this legislation. We believe all institutions of higher education should have policies to keep all their students safe. Because every student deserves a positive educational experience in a safe environment free of harassment, bullying or humiliation, where they can learn, study and thrive regardless of their race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or whatever else makes them special and precious; and every parent should have peace of mind that their children will be protected and free of harm while in the school\\'s care,\" said Jane Clementi, CEO and Founder of the Tyler Clementi Foundation and Tyler\\'s mother.\"No student should be subject to harassment or discrimination because of who they are or who they love,\" said David Stacy, HRC Director of Government Affairs. \"The past two years have seen a rollback of protections for LGBTQ students by the Trump-Pence-DeVos administration. The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act is a significant step forward in curbing anti-LGBTQ harassment and fostering environments that are affirming and encouraging for LGBTQ students. We thank Senators Patty Murray and Tammy Baldwin and Congressman Mark Pocan for their leadership.\"\"Harassment is rampant on college campuses and undermines students\\' ability to thrive in a safe environment,\" said Fatima Goss Graves, President and CEO of the National Women\\'s Law Center (NWLC). \"This bill is a critical step forward in combatting this scourge. It strengthens protections against harassment and would support much needed prevention and training programs. Every student in America deserves the right to learn without fear. This bill helps make that promise a reality.\"In addition to Senators Murray and Baldwin, the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act is also cosponsored by Senators Blumenthal (D-CT), Booker (D-NJ), Cardin (D-MD), Casey (D-PA), Duckworth (IL), Feinstein (D-CA), Gillibrand (D-NY), Harris (D-CA), Hassan (D-NH), Hirono (D-HI), Klobuchar (D-MN), Markey (D-MA), Menendez (D-NJ), Merkley (D-OR), Rosen (D-NV), Sanders (D-VT), Schatz (D-HI), Shaheen (D-NH), Smith (D-MN), Van Hollen (D-MD), Warren (D-MA), Whitehouse (D-RI), and Wyden (D-OR).In addition to Congressman Pocan, the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act is also cosponsored by Representatives Bonamici, Brownley, Carbajal, Cárdenas, Cicilline, Cohen, Craig, Crist, DelBene, Susan Davis, Deutch, Engel, Eshoo, Garamendi, Grijalva, Hayes, Jackson Lee, Jayapal, Kilmer, Larsen, Lieu, Lowenthal, Carolyn Maloney, Sean Patrick Maloney, McCollum, Meng, Moore, Morelle, Moulton, Nadler, Norton, Pallone, Panetta, Peters, Pappas, Rice, Roybal-Allard, Ryan, Scanlon, Schakowsky, Schiff, Soto, Swalwell, Mike Thompson, Titus, Wasserman Schultz, and Watson Coleman.The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act has been endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), Tyler Clementi Foundation, National Women\\'s Law Center (NWLC), National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, American Association of University Women (AAUW), GLSEN, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.To read the fact sheet of the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act, click here.',\n",

Upon completing the training and inquiring about the issue, a Member was told that the program facilitators were directed to explicitly exclude guidance about discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity as part of the training.\"While the stated goal of the training is laudable, comprehensive guidance on critical workplace safety issues requires a discussion of harassment and discrimination related to sexual orientation and gender identity.

       "  'date': 'March 2, 2017',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) led a bipartisan letter with 121 Members of Congress to the President urging him to reverse the recent decision to rescind guidance regarding protections for transgender students under Title IX. The letter also asks the President to meet with transgender students and their families to hear their stories and learn from their experiences.In the bipartisan letter, the Members of Congress state:\"Title IX provides transgender students the right to equal treatment in accordance with their gender identity. Unfortunately, rescinding this guidance only serves to confuse school administrators and take away a vital tool for students and their families who want to be treated with dignity and respect.\"Further, this action sends the wrong message - a very dangerous message - to transgender youth and their peers. For these reasons, we urge you to reverse your decision and reinstate the Title IX guidance.\"The bipartisan letter is supported by the ACLU, GLSEN, Human Rights Campaign, National Black Justice Coalition, National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE), National LGBTQ Task Force Action Fund, PFLAG, Transgender Law Center, and the Center for American Progress.The text of the letter is below and an electronic copy can be found here.President Donald J. TrumpThe White HouseWashington, DC 20500Dear President Trump:We write to urge you to reconsider your decision to rescind important Title IX guidance detailing schools\\' obligation to protect transgender students from discrimination. The guidance set forth by both the Departments of Education and Justice in May 2016 has helped educational institutions answer common, practical questions concerning this population of students while maintaining compliance with the law. Further, we ask you and members of your administration to meet with transgender students and their families who have relied on this guidance for a safe learning environment and hear their stories about what it means to be transgender in school.Hundreds of thousands of transgender students live and attend school in every part of our country. A recent report by the Williams Institute estimated there are over 350,000 transgender teens and young adults between ages 13 and 24 in America. Studies show that transgender students are healthy and successful when they receive support and fair treatment, but too many of these students face discrimination. The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found that more than three-quarters (77%) of respondents who identified or were perceived as transgender in K–12 school had one or more negative experiences, such as being verbally harassed, prohibited from dressing according to their gender identity, or physically or sexually assaulted. Singling out transgender students by excluding them from school facilities and forcing them to use separate facilities is a real and harmful form of discrimination that causes humiliation and puts students at risk for bullying and health problems.The federal guidance issued in May 2016 pertaining to transgender students reflects over a decade of case law and proven best practices from schools around the country. The Departments issued this guidance at the request of educators across the country seeking clarification about how to best comply with existing laws. National leaders in education - including the leading associations of teachers, principals, pediatricians, and school counselors and psychologists - supported this clarification.Title IX provides transgender students the right to equal treatment in accordance with their gender identity. Unfortunately, rescinding this guidance only serves to confuse school administrators and take away a vital tool for students and their families who want to be treated with dignity and respect. Further, this action sends the wrong message - a very dangerous message - to transgender youth and their peers.For these reasons, we urge you to reverse your decision and reinstate the Title IX guidance. Furthermore, we urge you, the U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and U.S. Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to meet with transgender students and their families to hear firsthand about their school experiences. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.# # #',\n",

       "  'date': 'January 12, 2017',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI), David Cicilline (D-RI), Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), Jared Polis (D-CO) and Mark Takano (D-CA), Co-Chairs of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, today sent a letter to members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) urging them to closely examine Secretary of Education nominee Betsy DeVos\\' views on issues affecting LGBT students and parents during her confirmation process.\"It is unfathomable that the next Secretary of Education would oppose basic protections for LGBT students and roll back the progress we have made to ensure all students feel safe and supported in our schools,\" said Rep. Pocan. \"Ms. DeVos\\' history of opposing equality for LGBT individuals is deeply troubling, and the public deserves to know whether she will work with us to improve lives or continue to advocate an extremist agenda that bullies our students.\"The letter specifically highlights the millions of dollars DeVos and her family have contributed to organizations and candidates that oppose equality for LGBT families and actively promote dangerous practices like \"conversion therapy.\" Rep. Pocan and his colleagues called on Senate HELP Committee members to demand Ms. DeVos denounce these inhumane positions and stand up for policies to protect LGBT students and parents before being confirmed.Below is the text of the letter and you can find a digital copy of the letter here.Dear Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray:            As Co-Chairs of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, we write to express our deep concern with President-elect Donald Trump\\'s nominee for the Secretary of the United States Department of Education, Betsy DeVos. While Ms. DeVos\\' stances on a number of public education issues raise concerns, we cannot hold our silence regarding her opposition to the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students.  Betsy DeVos\\' career has been marked by repeated attempts to undermine the rights of the LGBT community. She and her family have donated extensively to groups which promote the idea that students who identify as LGBT must undergo \"conversion\" therapy and have also affiliated with groups that oppose anti-bullying legislation. The next Secretary of Education must represent all students in our country. Anyone who promotes such fervently anti-LGBT viewpoints is wholly unqualified to serve as the Secretary of Education.              Since 1998, Betsy DeVos and her family\\'s foundations have donated at least $6.1 million to Focus on the Family, a right-wing organization which has spent millions of dollars attempting to defeat marriage equality amendments at the state level. Even more troubling, this organization supported by the DeVos family promotes \"conversion therapy,\" opposes the right of LGBT parents to adopt children, and has referred to transgender individuals as \"mentally ill.\" This organization has even gone so far to oppose anti-bullying policies and opposes basic workplace protections for LGBT individuals. The DeVos family\\'s support for anti-LGBT groups and policies extends beyond just this organization to many other groups known for their anti-LGBT activities, such as: $1,000,000 to the Institute for Marriage and Public Policy, which has claimed that the overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act amounted to a \"fatwa;\"$15,000 to the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which has opposed adoption with same-sex couples;$433,750 to the Council for National Policy, a highly secretive group that is led by extremists like Focus on the Family\\'s James Dobson among other extremists; and $13,498,000 to the Heritage Foundation, which has stated that \"Despite activist judges\\' opinions, the majority of Americans continue to affirm the reasonable conclusion that marriage is the union of one man and one woman.\" The DeVos family does not stop with contributions to intolerant organizations as they also support anti-LGBT politicians. For example, the DeVos family - including Ms. DeVos - were top contributors to Michigan State Representative Andrea LaFontaine, who sponsored legislation allowing adoption agencies to discriminate against LGBT parents and deny them the ability to adopt a child.             The LGBT community has made significant and long overdue advancements when it comes to equality in education. During President Obama\\'s tenure in office, the Department of Education took important steps to combat bullying and ensure that Title IX, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, appropriately reflects the rights of transgender students. It is imperative that the rights of LGBT students are adequately protected moving forward.             As you move to consider the nomination of Betsy DeVos, we strongly encourage you to seek out answers regarding Ms. DeVos\\' stance on important education equity issues, including her views on protecting LGBT students from bullying and discrimination in K-12 and higher education spaces. We are particularly troubled by Betsy DeVos\\' past support for inhumane \"conversion therapy\" treatments and believe it is imperative that any Secretary of Education nominee denounce such practices before being confirmed.             As Members of the LGBT community, we know our schools must be a safe place for all children. As you consider the nomination of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education, we strongly encourage you to stand up for the civil rights of LGBT students and ensure the next Secretary opposes any action to roll back our progress toward equality.',\n",

Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Richard Hanna (R-NY) led a bipartisan letter to President Obama urging him to direct all federal agencies to prohibit discrimination in federal government contracting and subcontracting based on the sexual orientation or gender identity of the business owner.In the letter, the members write, “There are an estimated 1.4 million LGBT-owned businesses in the United States – in Congressional districts in all 50 states – that represent an untapped well of innovation, job creation, and economic growth.

We respectfully urge you to direct all federal agencies to prohibit discrimination in federal government contracting and subcontracting based on the sexual orientation or gender identity of the business owner.There are an estimated 1.4 million LGBT-owned businesses in the United States – in Congressional districts in all 50 states – that represent an untapped well of innovation, job creation, and economic growth. However, no protections exist to prohibit discrimination against these businesses in federal procurement. The history of discrimination against LGBT individuals by the federal government and lack of any protections for LGBT-owned businesses perpetuate a sense among these businesses that the federal government is not open to them, and among major federal contractors that seeking out LGBT-owned suppliers is not necessary.LGBT-owned businesses have much to contribute and gain from federal government contracting opportunities. Ensuring that no barriers exist for LGBT-owned businesses in federal contracting will also benefit the federal government and American taxpayers by creating a larger and more visible pool of diverse suppliers who can provide goods and services to the federal government. It will also provide prime federal contractors with more options to find subcontractors that provide good value.Your Administration has already taken significant steps to ensure there is LGBT equality in federal contracting, particularly as it related to the employees of federal contractors.  Now it is time to finish the job and ensure that contractors and subcontractors themselves cannot face discrimination either.We look forward to working with you to ensure that the federal government is clearly opening its doors for business with the LGBT community. # # #',\n",

As we welcome a new era of inclusion in our armed forces, we must put a process in place to correct the injustices of systematic discrimination many LGBT individuals faced while serving their country.

       "  'text': \"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), Co-Chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus, released the following statement on the tragic mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. The shooting claimed the lives of 49 people as they celebrated Pride Month, making it the largest mass shooting in our nation’s history.“As we grapple with the horrific events that took place yesterday morning in Orlando, my thoughts are with the families of the victims and everyone affected during Pride Month. The targeting of the LGBT individuals in this heinous act of violence has reignited many fears and uncertainty in our community. As a country, we must stand together to denounce bigotry and hatred and embrace love and acceptance.“President Barack Obama declared this ‘an act of terror and an act of hate,’ an action perpetrated with a military-style assault weapon. Across the country people are asking themselves what they can do to help and what can be done to prevent such a devastating event from happening again.“As a Member of Congress I contemplated these thoughts as well, ultimately coming to the conclusion that Congress won't do a thing about any of these issues again this week. In fact, all too often actions and language here in Congress and on the campaign trail actually exacerbate would-be terrorists. And actions even on the Floor of the House of Representatives all too often reinforce the hate of some people. Unfortunately, this body is too chicken to address the epidemic of military-style assault weapons because that would upset the gun manufacturers and special interests.“In the end all we will do is have yet another moment of silence, rather than a moment of action. That disrespects the lives of the people who were killed not just yesterday, but every day by gun violence. There may be blood in the streets, but if Congress continues to fail to act, we will have blood on our hands.”# # #\",\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), along with 26 House Democrats, sent a letter to President Obama urging him to consider renegotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) to include explicit protections for the LGBT community.While negotiators attempted to make progress on various human rights issues through the TPP, the agreement does not include protections for LGBT individuals. A number of participating countries have detailed histories of oppressing their citizens on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Specifically, Malaysia and Brunei have penal codes criminalizing LGBT individuals and authorities continue to persecute members ofthis community. The letter was also signed by Reps. David Cicilline (D-RI), John Conyers (D-MI), Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Donna Edwards (D-MD), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Mike Honda (D-CA), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), William Keating (D-MA), Dan Kildee (D-MI), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), Betty McCollum (D-MN), Jim McDermott (D-WA), Jim McGovern (D-MA), Jerry McNerney (D-CA), Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Loretta Sanchez (D-CA), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Brad Sherman (D-CA),  Louise Slaughter (D-NY), Eric Swalwell (D-CA), and Paul Tonko (D-NY).The text of the letter is below and signed version can be found here. Dear Mr. President:We write today to expand on concerns previously expressed by Members of Congress pertaining to the treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals living in countries included in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. Specifically, we are concerned about recent actions taken by the Malaysian government against the transgender community and the missed opportunity presented by the TPP to combat the anti-LGBT actions of multiple countries in the agreement.As we have expressed in the past, we deeply appreciate that your Administration has been a champion for LGBT individuals in the United States and across the globe. By speaking out in favor of equality for all individuals regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, you have made the United States an example for the world. However, we believe more can and must be done to protect LGBT people abroad, and the TPP offers a clear opportunity to leverage changes in countries persecuting these individuals.We are particularly concerned with the continued persecution of the transgender community in Malaysia. Last year, Malaysian officials entered a private event and arrested the nine attendees under a law that criminalizes transgender individuals wearing clothing matching the gender with which they identify. The court subsequently sentenced the nine women to fines and two of the women to jail.In April, Malaysian religious authorities raided an event benefitting the transgender community, resulting in the arrest and potential imprisonment of the event organizer and the threat of imprisonment against a lawyer who defended the transgender attendees.  These are just two examples in a long history of abuses by Malaysian authorities, incidents which underscore the concerns previously raised about severe human rights abuses and penal codes permitting violence against LGBT people in Malaysia and Brunei.For these reasons, we urge you to use the opportunity presented by the United States’ inclusion in the Trans-Pacific Partnership to explicitly protect LGBT individuals in the agreement’s participating countries. This agreement encompasses nearly forty percent of the global economy and the United States has the largest economy of the twelve participating countries. The United States should use this position of strength to advocate for the fair treatment of the LGBT community in Malaysia and Brunei. Unfortunately, while the Administration attempted to address other human rights issues in our partner countries, the agreement and side letters as negotiated do not include protections for LGBT individuals.Given the continued prevalence of attacks on the LGBT community in Malaysia and Brunei, we urge you to consider renegotiating the agreement to include protections for gender and sexual minorities and further demand that these countries treat all of their citizens as equal under the law regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.# # #',\n",

While Governor Walker and Schimel may couch this decision in protecting Wisconsin’s interests, nothing could be farther from the truth. It’s a poor and pitiful attempt to catch a dying wave of shameful political attacks on transgender youth, in an effort to advance an antiquated ideology.“Instead, we should be looking to support policies in our schools that make students safer, not eliminate protections for some of our most vulnerable students. Many of our country’s leading education groups including the National PTA and the National Education Association have embraced these federal guidelines, signaling they would provide students with safe and welcoming schools. I couldn’t agree more. We cannot lose sight of the fact that these are students who want nothing more than to live authentic lives free of discrimination.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Charles Rangel (D-NY) today sent a letter to Chairman Mac Thornberry requesting the House Committee on Armed Services hold a hearing on the challenges faced by gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members who were discharged from the military on the basis of their sexual orientation.The letter states: “Since World War II, more than 100,000 individuals are estimated to have been discharged from the military due to their sexual orientation. Today, thousands of gay, lesbian, and bisexual veterans are tarnished with discharge statuses other than honorable. This status affects both their access to benefits they have earned from their service and their opportunities in civilian life, potentially hindering employment opportunities and the right to vote.”Reps. Pocan and Rangel previously introduced the Restore Honor to Service Members Act in July 2015, which would help service members discharged solely due to their sexual orientation correct their military records to reflect their honorable service and reinstate the benefits they earned. The Restore Honor to Service Members Act has 113 cosponsors, including 4 Republicans, in the House and 38 cosponsors in the Senate.A signed copy of the letter can be found here and the full text is below.Dear Chairman Thornberry:We write today to request the House Committee on Armed Services hold a hearing on the challenges faced by gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members who were discharged from the military on the basis of their sexual orientation and who seek to have their discharge characterization upgraded to “honorable.” Specifically, we request the Committee examine undue difficulties in the current review process and evaluate bipartisan solutions to address these problems. The repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” in 2011 represented a significant step forward for our military and brought justice to thousands of gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members. This change allowed all individuals wishing to serve our country the opportunity to do so without being forced to hide who they are, and signaled to those discharged due to their sexual orientation that their service is deeply valued. Our military readiness and national security are stronger and we are closer to the American ideals of fairness and equality due to the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” Unfortunately, too many service members still bear the scars of this discriminatory policy. Since World War II, more than 100,000 individuals are estimated to have been discharged from the military due to their sexual orientation. Today, the records of thousands of gay, lesbian, and bisexual veterans are tarnished with discharge statuses other than honorable. This status affects both their access to benefits they have earned from their service and their opportunities in civilian life, potentially hindering employment opportunities and the right to vote. Even those discharged under “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” who received an honorable discharge status risk facing discrimination and a violation of privacy because the Narrative Reason for their discharge may include “Homosexual Conduct,” “Homosexual Act,” or “Homosexual Marriage.”In response to the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the Department of Defense (DoD) took an important step by implementing a process for service members to appeal their discharge status and change their discharge narrative. However, this can be a burdensome course of action for service members, who often need to obtain legal counsel to navigate the process and provide paperwork they may no longer have. We have introduced the Restore Honor to Service Members Act in order to streamline and codify the current DoD policy, ensuring all gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members have the opportunity to correct their record and affirm their honorable service. This legislation simplifies the paperwork requirement for a service member to initiate a review and clarifies that a review cannot be denied solely based on a lack of documentation. Further, the bill moves the burden to produce relevant documentation from the service member to the DoD. Lastly, the legislation requires military service historians to review the circumstances of these discharges, helping service members prove they were discharged solely due to their sexual orientation. The Restore Honor to Service Members Act has gained broad, bipartisan support in the United States Congress – 113 cosponsors in the 114th Congress – and offers a strong path forward to address current difficulties.Our service members deserve a straightforward and accessible process to ensure their honorable service is reflected in their records. For these reasons, we urge the House Committee on Armed Services to schedule a hearing on this issue in the near future. We look forward to your response.',\n",

       "  'date': 'March 10, 2016',\n",
       "  'text': 'MADISON – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) has yet to receive a response from Justice Rebecca Bradley after he extended an invitation to her to come and meet with the LGBT community and those living with HIV/AIDS, as well as others she targeted in a series of public writings. In an interview with The Capital Times earlier this week, Bradley indicated that she would be willing to do this meeting.“Bradley’s comments over the last 48 hours have been purely spin, not substance,” said Rep. Mark Pocan. “She seems to be throwing darts at a dart board trying to see what sticks. For example, it’s been more than 500 days since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed same-sex marriages to proceed, yet Bradley has not performed a single same-sex marriage, even though her campaign insists she is open to it. Many Judges in Milwaukee were rushing to volunteer to perform them. If she really has had a mosaic of experiences that changed her worldview why hasn’t one of those been performing a same-sex marriage ceremony? The problem for Bradley is that she can’t point to anything she has written or made public in the last two decades that show a change of heart and the people of Wisconsin deserve the truth. That is why I am baffled she will not directly respond to our invitation.”Bradley also mentioned on Monday that her public writings were a result of her being upset about the outcome of the 1992 presidential election, but two of the pieces were published in February of 1992, almost 10 months earlier, indicating a consistent worldview, rather than something written in the heat of the moment. In the last several days, she has insinuated that attending an event by the LGBT rights group Fair Wisconsin, as a candidate attempting to get votes for Milwaukee Circuit Court, is an example of her change of heart.That only begs another question Bradley should answer for the public: Is she more concerned about alienating constituents and groups that are extremely active spending large sums of dark money to support her and have proven ties with an anti-equality agenda, such as the shadowy Wisconsin Alliance for Reform? Itswebsite was registered by Lorri Pickens, the 2006 campaign manager for the anti-marriage equality group Vote Yes for Marriage in Wisconsin.“These are exactly the type of misleading comments and unanswered questions that have so many people in Wisconsin worried about her temperament serving on our state’s highest court,” continued Rep. Mark Pocan. “Attending events to stump for votes does not demonstrate remorse nor absolve appointed Justice Bradley from her vitriolic statements of hatred. While I understand she is embarrassed that these public writings have surfaced, her comments to the press since Monday have been emblematic of a calculated politician doing damage control, not someone who has had a true change of heart.”',\n",

U.S. Rep.

Bradley concluded it claiming her crude, bigoted ideas should have no impact on current Wisconsin voters while giving no explanation of her claimed change of heart. To even insinuate that these hateful sentiments were acceptable in 1992 throws into question what Rebecca Bradley really believes and if she is truly fair and impartial enough to serve on our state’s highest court.“I would like to extend an offer to Justice Bradley to come and meet with the LBGT community and those living with HIV/AIDS, as well as others she targeted in her public writings such as their supportive family members, environmentalists, people struggling with substance abuse, and women making private health decisions.

       "  'date': 'November 5, 2015',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawai‘i), Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) and Members of the LGBT Equality Caucus urged the passage of the Restore Honor to Service Members Act at a press conference on Capitol Hill. The legislation would help service members discharged solely due to their sexual orientation correct their military records to reflect their honorable service and reinstate the benefits they earned. \"We have a sacred commitment to every American who serves in our military.  But for the 100,000 brave Americans who were forced out for being gay, we have failed to honor that commitment,\" said Senator Schatz. \"The Restore Honor to Service Members Act would give these veterans a chance to correct their military records—to remove an unwarranted discharge that was given to them for no other reason than being gay.  It would remove the mark of shame they carry, give them access to benefits, and finally give them the respect and honor they rightly deserve.\"\"As we approach Veterans Day, it\\'s important to remember the sacrifices our veterans have made for our country,\" said Rep. Pocan, co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus. \"This includes the selfless service of more than 100,000 veterans who were discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation. Our legislation ensures that gay veterans who served our country no longer live with tarnished records that prohibit them from receiving the recognition, benefits and honors they deserve.\"\"As a veteran, I know that our men and women in uniform give all to serve our country with great honor,\" said Rep. Rangel. \"We can no longer delay honoring these veterans who deserve long overdue recognition.  We struck down ‘Don\\'t Ask, Don\\'t Tell\\' and legalized same sex marriage.  Love is not dishonorable.\"Since World War II, more than 100,000 Americans are estimated to have been discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation.  Those forced out of the military may have left with discharge statuses of \"other than honorable,\" \"general discharge\" or \"dishonorable,\" depending on the circumstances.  As a consequence, many of these service members may be disqualified from accessing certain benefits that they earned and are entitled to, and may not be able to claim veteran status.  The consequences of a negative discharge also include preventing some veterans from voting or making it more difficult for them to acquire civilian employment.  The legislation is supported by Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, VoteVets.org, OutServe-SLDN, the Human Rights Campaign, American Veterans for Equal Rights, Lambda Legal, Swords to Plowshares, the American Bar Association, Universal Unitarian Association, and the American Humanist Association.In addition to Representatives Pocan and Rangel, The Restore Honor to Service Members Act has 109 cosponsors, including 4 Republicans, in the House and 37 cosponsors in the Senate.# # #',\n",

       "  'date': 'October 8, 2015',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, DC – Today, Reps. Adam Schiff (D-CA), Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Brian Higgins (D-NY) along with twenty-nine other congressional colleagues sent a letter to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administration Peter Neffenger urging changes in the way that the agency screens transgender passengers. The letter comes on the heels of reports of a transgender traveler, Shadi Petosky, being detained and put through inappropriate airport security screening procedures by Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) at the Orlando International Airport due to a misunderstanding about her gender identity as a trans-woman. The Members urge the TSA to adopt a screening protocol that does not rely on Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) making often-subjective decisions about an individual\\'s gender identity. The letter also requests the TSA provide guidance on screening procedures to the transgender community, ensure that TSA personnel receive adequate training on gender identity issues, and requests the TSA to participate in the investigations by the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services into Ms. Petosky\\'s case.In the letter, the Members write: \"It is a sad reality that members of the transgender community face adversity every day. The experiences of many transgender airline passengers such as Ms. Petosky demonstrate that more must be done to ensure transgender individuals are able to travel without fear of facing humiliation or degradation at security checkpoints. While being mindful of enacting the appropriate security precautions to keep all travelers safe, the TSA must also take steps to ensure that its employees are prepared to serve transgender individuals with the dignity, discretion, and respect that they, like all Americans, deserve.\"Joining Schiff, Pocan and Higgins in signing the letter were Reps. Donald S. Beyer, Jr. (D-VA), Tony Cardenas (D-CA), Judy Chu (D-CA), David N. Cicilline (D-RI), Katherine Clark (D-MA), Suzan DelBene (D-WA), Sam Farr (D-CA), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Steve Israel (D-NY), William R. Keating (D-MA), Joseph P.

The text is below:Dear Administrator Neffenger:We write to express our strong concerns regarding the treatment of transgender individuals by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). As you know, a transgender traveler, Shadi Petosky has reported that, on September 21, 2015, she was detained by Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) at the Orlando International Airport due to a misunderstanding about her gender identity as a trans-woman. Unfortunately, Ms. Petosky\\'s experience is just the latest of a string of reports from travelers across the country.  In the days since Ms. Petosky\\'s story became public, we have heard from numerous members of the transgender community describing harassing and humiliating experiences while going through airport security. While we understand the importance of vigilant airport security, we cannot countenance a security protocol that subjects transgender travelers to this level of indignity. To that end, we urge TSA to complete a thorough review of its current procedures and address any shortcomings that may, however unintentionally, subject transgender travelers to inequitable or improper treatment by security personnel.First, TSA must recognize its procedures regarding the use of full-body scanners present unique challenges for transgender passengers. As you know, TSOs must select a male or female button in order to configure a scanner to a gender-specific setting prior to screening. Under this system, an error-free reading of a passenger\\'s scan image relies on a TSO making a discretionary determination about a passenger\\'s sex based on their appearance rather than the gender with which they identify. This protocol may be well-suited to screen some cisgender passengers, but they do so at the expense of singling out transgender or gender nonconforming individuals whose physical appearances may not necessarily match their biological sex. In light of this issue, we urge the TSA to implement a screening protocol that does not rely on TSOs making often-subjective decisions about an individual\\'s gender identity. As evidenced by Ms. Petosky\\'s experience and the myriad other stories we have heard recently, such a protocol can put transgender passengers at greater risk of being incorrectly screened, thereby unduly requiring them to undergo a \"pat down\" -- an additional procedure which many have found to be extremely invasive and degrading.Second, we believe there is insufficient guidance on TSA screening procedures readily available to the transgender community. For example, while the current screening process seems to suggest that it is incumbent upon a transgender passenger to inform personnel of his or her gender identification prior to screening, such a policy has not been published on the TSA\\'s website or made widely known to the public. Additionally, while TSA has stated transgender passengers may request a private screening, it is unclear based on publicly-available information what a private screening entails, whether a private screening can be requested in lieu of a full-body scanner, or at what point in the security screening process it should be requested. Moreover, there exists no public guidance to reassure transgender travelers that they will not have to reveal the use of any prosthetic devices or binding materials while in a public area. To ensure transgender passengers are fully informed about all security screening expectations, we request that the TSA publishes detailed guidelines on its website to address these commonly asked questions, among others, and to include a clear explanation of the civil rights protections to which all transgender passengers are entitled to during the screening process. Further, we request more prominent visibility of the TSA Cares helpline and other available resources on the TSA website so those with additional questions have a clear and accessible way to gather information on remaining concerns.In addition, we request that all TSA personnel are adequately trained to serve the transgender community. It is insufficient to provide only TSO supervisors with \"cultural awareness training.\" We ask that such trainings should be required for all TSOs that work with the public, that they be held live and in-person (as opposed to the simple distribution of written materials), and that these trainings specifically cover the particular sensitivities and vulnerabilities of transgender travelers.Finally, we are pleased to hear that the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services have launched an investigation into Ms. Petosky\\'s case to determine whether there were any civil rights violations. We request the TSA\\'s full cooperation in this investigation and urge the TSA to maintain transparency by sharing the results of the probe with transgender community advocacy organizations and with the undersigned. It is a sad reality that members of the transgender community face adversity every day. The experiences of many transgender airline passengers such as Ms. Petosky demonstrate that more must be done to ensure transgender individuals are able to travel without fear of facing humiliation or degradation at security checkpoints. While being mindful of enacting the appropriate security precautions to keep all travelers safe, the TSA must also take steps to ensure that its employees are prepared to serve transgender individuals with the dignity, discretion, and respect that they, like all Americans, deserve. We appreciate your willingness to engage on this important issue. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.Sincerely,###',\n",

This bill would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 (DOMA) in its entirety, providing equality under the law and certainty for all married couples with regard to critical federal obligations and benefits.  \"With over 35 states recognizing same sex marriages, it is time we bring more fairness and stability to the lives of these married couples and their families,\" said Representative Mark Pocan. \"The Respect for Marriage Act would ensure equal treatment under federal law and finally put to rest the awful consequences of DOMA.\"\"While we have made great strides towards equality for the LGBT community, we must continue to fight for the thousands of individuals still discriminated against merely because of whom they love,\" said Representative Pocan. \"We must not stop fighting until all 50 states recognize all relationships equally and all citizens equally under the law.\"The Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Windsor resulted in the federal government granting marriage recognition based on a state\\'s recognition of the marriage. The Respect for Marriage Act would provide a uniform marriage recognition rule, ensuring a marriage is valid under the law of the state where performed and is recognized for purposes of federal law.  This ensures key federal agencies such as the Social Security Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs recognize all married couples, guaranteeing the ability of these couples to plan for a future of mutual obligation and support with confidence.    A tireless advocate for the rights of the LGBT community, Pocan has been married to his husband Phil since 2006.  ###',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, Congressman Ron Kind (WI-3), Congresswoman Gwen Moore (WI-4) and Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-2) have sent a letter to United States Attorney General Eric Holder asking that the same-sex couples in Wisconsin who have received marriage licenses be recognized for federal purposes.They write, \"To date, same-sex couples across Wisconsin have received marriage licenses, and officials in counties throughout the state continue to issue licenses to eligible couples.  These loving couples have valid marriage licenses and should receive the same federal recognition that all other married Wisconsin couples currently do.\"Following last summer\\'s U.S. Supreme Court decision in United States v. Windsor, the Department of Justice has led the federal government\\'s effort to ensure that all lawfully-married same-sex couples have equal access to federal rights and benefits.  As a result, couples who had legally married are able to access benefits including federal taxes, immigration, federal employee and service member benefits, and family and medical leave. The letter continues, \"Now that Judge Crabb\\'s decision has allowed many of them to obtain marriage licenses, the federal government should provide Wisconsin\\'s married same-sex couples with all of these federal benefits now available to them under the law.\"The full text of the letter can be found here and below.The Honorable Eric H. Holder, Jr.The Attorney GeneralU.S. Department of JusticeWashington, DC 20530Dear Attorney General Holder:We write to ask you to formally recognize for all federal purposes the marriages between same-sex couples that have been performed in the State of Wisconsin since a federal district judge invalidated the state\\'s constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage on June 6.  To date, same-sex couples across Wisconsin have received marriage licenses, and officials in counties throughout the state continue to issue licenses to eligible couples.  These loving couples have valid marriage licenses and should receive the same federal recognition that all other married Wisconsin couples currently do.    On June 6, U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Crabb ruled that Wisconsin\\'s constitutional and statutory restrictions on marriage for same-sex couples violate the Fourteenth Amendment\\'s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses.  She did not immediately stay her decision and, within hours, some county clerks opened their doors to same-sex couples seeking to marry.  On Friday, Judge Crabb issued a stay of her decision while the state pursues an appeal, thereby suspending further marriages in the interim.  Following last summer\\'s U.S. Supreme Court decision in United States v. Windsor, you have led the federal government\\'s effort to ensure that all lawfully-married same-sex couples have equal access to federal rights and benefits.  As a result, couples who had legally married are finally treated equally and are able to access:·         the ability to sponsor a foreign spouse for legal residency in the United States;·         health, workers compensation, retirement and other benefits for the spouse of a federal employee;·         health benefits, spousal ID cards, housing allowances and on-base support services for the spouse of a service member;·         joint federal income tax filings, as well as spousal exemptions from federal taxation of gifts, inheritances and the value of employer-provided  spousal               health coverage;·         unpaid family and medical leave to care for an ill spouse;·         and hundreds of other rights and benefits.  However, until last week, same-sex couples in Wisconsin were unable to receive these benefits because they could not lawfully marry.  Now that Judge Crabb\\'s decision has allowed many of them to obtain marriage licenses, the federal government should provide Wisconsin\\'s married same-sex couples with all of these federal benefits now available to them under the law.       Earlier this year, you made clear that couples who married in Utah and Michigan after federal judges struck down those states\\' bans are entitled to full federal recognition.  We are grateful for this tremendous leadership on behalf of fairness and equality.  We ask that you similarly declare that those same-sex couples who married in Wisconsin since the June 6 decision are equally entitled to the federal benefits they deserve.

This protection for LGBT workers is long overdue.  Congress must still act on the Employer Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) to ensure all workers are protected from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.  We need to give LGBT workers a fair shot to get ahead in life by making sure employers cannot fire, harass, deny a raise, or refuse to hire someone based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Only 21 states have made it illegal to fire or harass someone based on sexual orientation, or to deny a raise or refuse to hire on that same basis.  Wisconsin has been a leader on this issue, becoming the first state to ban public and private sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1982.###',\n",

The United States is committed to protecting the rights of religious minorities, LGBT individuals and women across the globe. Moreover, time and again, the United States has spoken out against anti-LGBT activity and discriminatory laws in countries like Nigeria and Uganda and against unequal protection of women, in countries such as Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, and against the persecution of religious minorities in the Central African Republic, China, and Pakistan.Brunei's adoption of the revised penal code legalizes violence against its citizens, constituting torture or other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment. The United States must make it clear that we will not tolerate such abuses. International trade partners have much to gain from an economic relationship with the United States, and our trade agreements should insist that participating countries adhere to internationally recognized civil, political, and human rights standards. Targeting LGBT individuals or religious minorities and opening the door for discrimination and violence against women is a threat we cannot overlook, and should trade agreements like the TPP go into effect with the participation of human rights violators, the United States would lose its leverage to provide economic pressure on countries to reverse unacceptable policies.As the world's largest economy, the United States holds a significant place in world affairs and must use this position to address human rights atrocities in countries like Brunei. According with all applicable rules and regulations, we urge you to insist that Brunei address these human rights violations as a condition before the United States enter into any trade negotiations.###\",\n",

       "  'date': 'January 30, 2014',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Charlie Rangel (NY-13), lead sponsors of the bipartisan “Restore Honor to Service Members Act,” today applauded the introduction of this bill in the U.S. Senate by Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). The “Restore Honor to Service Members Act,” which Pocan and Rangel introduced in the House in July, would instill the repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” into law and ensure that gay and lesbian veterans who were discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation receive the honor and recognition they deserve. A statement from Pocan and Rangel is below:“We applaud Senators Schatz and Gillibrand for introducing the “Restore Honor to Service Members Act” in the Senate and standing up for our gay and lesbian veterans. This bill would close the book on “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” and provide tens of thousands of gay veterans, who selflessly risked their lives for our nation. Our bill already has the support of more than 140 House members, and we look forward to working with Senators Schatz and Gillibrand to ensure it can pass Congress and get to the President’s desk.”The “Restore Honor to Service Members Act” is about more than upgrading a piece of paper. Since World War II to the repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” in 2011, approximately 114,000 service members were discharged because of their sexual orientation. Every form of discharge previously given out prior to the repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” carries with it consequences that can follow a service member for his or her entire life. While the characterization of the discharges varied, many members received discharges that were classified as\"other than honorable\" or \"dishonorable\", particularly prior to the implementation of the “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy in 1993.  In many states, a dishonorable discharge is treated as a felony, and service members receiving a \"general discharge\", a lesser offense, can encounter grave difficulties acquiring civilian employment. All were barred from reenlisting in the military. Depending on the discharge received, service members may also be blocked from voting, unemployment benefits, participating in the GI Bill or receiving veteran benefits such as health care, VA disability, and ceremonial burial rights at military cemeteries. The “Restore Honor to Service Members Act,” turns the current broad review policy outlined in a memo from the Under Secretary of Defense into clear and settled law. It ensures all services members who were previously discharged because of their sexual orientation receive a timely, consistent and transparent review of their records so that gay veterans who served honorably have their records rightfully upgraded to honorable.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today applauded the U.S. Senate on its bipartisan passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) and called on Speaker Boehner to bring the commonsense legislation up for a vote in the House. ENDA would extend federal employment discrimination protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Pocan is an original co-sponsor of the House version of ENDA, which is currently supported by 196 bipartisan members of Congress.“I congratulate the Senate for confirming our country’s commitment to respecting the rights and liberties of all Americans, regardless of who they love,” said Pocan, co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus and member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the bill. “The basic principles of ENDA are so fundamental that 80 percent of Americans already believe it is law, and the Senate today has moved us one step closer to making that a reality. Speaker Boehner now has a choice—stand behind frivolous excuses and remain on the wrong side of history, or join with the majority of the American people and honor the equality deserved by all Americans.”Earlier this week, Speaker Boehner said he believed that ENDA would “increase frivolous litigation.” But a report this summer from the Government Accountability Office on the 21 states and D.C. that already bar workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation found “relatively few employment discrimination complaints based on sexual orientation and gender identity”—between 3-4 percent of the total number of employment discrimination claims.Despite the fact that a majority of Americans—including 56 percent of Republicans—and Fortune 500 companies support workplace protections for LGBT employees,  currently only 17 states and the District of Columbia prohibit discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, while an additional four prohibit employment discrimination based only on sexual orientation. According to a study from Pew Research, one of every five LGBT employees faces discrimination in their work environment because of their sexual orientation or gender indemnity.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—While the Supreme Court’s ruling in United States v. Windsor represented a landmark victory for equality and federal recognition of same sex marriages, discriminatory federal practices remain that leave employees in same-sex domestic partnerships without the rights and protections their heterosexual colleagues receive. In order to allow the federal government to compete for the best employees and ensure all of our nation’s civil servants have their loving relationships treated with respect and dignity, U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) and Gerry Connolly (D-VA) today introduced the bipartisan Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act (DPBO). The legislation would grant federal employees in same sex domestic partnerships the same rights, protections and obligations afforded to heterosexual married couples.U.S. Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Susan Collins (R-ME) today introduced the companion bill in the Senate.  “In a year of milestones for the equality movement, the federal government must continue to lead and ensure equal rights and benefits for all its civil servants,” said Pocan, a co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus. “Passage of our bipartisan legislation will remove discriminatory practices that punish certain federal employees merely for whom they love and where they live.  As the private sector has shown, policies that promote equality are not only the right thing to do, they also allow you to compete for the best and brightest employees.”“It has been a banner year for equality for all Americans but the Federal government still has much work to do. This is why my colleagues and I will present this bipartisan bill to ensure that employees in same sex domestic partnerships have the same rights and protections as heterosexual couples,” said Ros-Lehtinen, original co-founder and member of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus. “The Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act (DPBO) would achieve this and I’m honored to be an original co-sponsor of this common sense bill.”“Our bipartisan legislation will strengthen our Nation’s civil service by ensuring LGBT Federal employees are treated with fairness and respect, and agencies are empowered to effectively recruit and retain a talented workforce,” said Connolly. “I often hear that the Federal Government should be run more like a business. Well, from Boeing to GE, America’s leading companies have spoken loud and clear in recognizing that no organization can remain competitive in terms of attracting and retaining great talent while discriminating against same-sex couples.”   According to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), almost 60 percent of Fortune 500 companies and 19 State governments offer same-sex domestic partner benefits. The DPBO would empower federal agencies to compete with the private sector and state governments for the best and brightest employees.Under the bill, federal employees would need to file an affidavit asserting they are in a same-sex domestic partnership and are not married. The bill only applies to federal employees working in states where marriage equality is not currently recognized. Among the rights, benefits and obligations that would be extended to same-sex domestic partnerships include retirement benefits, health and life insurance, and death benefits. ###',\n",

Mark Pocan (WI-02) announced today that Madison-based Disability Rights Wisconsin has been awarded a $400,000 grant to address domestic abuse and sexual assault of people with disabilities. The Department of Justice issued the grant through the Violence Against Women Act’s (VAWA) Disability Grant Program. The Wisconsin Project is the only project nationally to be awarded funds since the inception of the federal Disabilities Grant Program.   Pocan is a staunch supporter of VAWA, and earlier this year fought for an expanded and inclusive reauthorization of the landmark legislation that was signed into law by President Obama. “All individuals who are the victims of sexual assault or domestic abuse deserve access to support services and full protection under the law,” said Pocan. “I thank Disability Rights Wisconsin for their work to ensure people with disabilities who have been subject to these crimes have a safe place to go to address their needs. This grant will ensure they can continue their important work for our disability and Deaf community in Wisconsin.” Individuals with disabilities face increased incidents of domestic abuse and sexual assault, but often times face gaps in services. Disability Rights Wisconsin will work with End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin (formerly the Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence) and the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault on this project to help establish collaborative and multi-disciplinary teams that can enhance the services and support available for persons with disabilities and Deaf who are victims of violence.“Disability Rights Wisconsin, End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin and Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault  are honored to have been awarded funds through the Office on Violence Against Women to continue the vital work of Wisconsin’s decade-long Violence Against Women with Disabilities and Deaf Women Project,” said Amy Judy, Project Coordinator for Disability Rights Wisconsin. “Our Project strives to ensure that Wisconsinites with disabilities and Deaf who have experienced sexual assault or domestic abuse will be supported by people and systems that reflect person-centered, safe and accessible responses.  Disability Rights Wisconsin is grateful for Congressman Pocan’s unwavering support of the Violence Against Women Act and its 2013 reauthorization which made this Disability Grant Program and the award possible.”###',\n",

       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, today applauded the decision by the U.S. Department of Treasury to recognize all legally married same-sex couples, regardless of whether or not they live in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage. The ruling means that married same-sex couples, including Pocan and his husband Phil, who were married in Canada in 2006, can now receive all federal marriage-based tax benefits, including employee benefits, child tax credits, and gift and estate taxes.“I applaud the Department of Treasury for siding with equality and treating all legally married couples in America the same,” said Pocan. “Loving same-sex couples should not be afraid they could lose their federal benefits or protections simply by moving to another state. Today’s decision continues our nation’s forceful progress toward recognizing the rights and responsibilities of all loving couples.”The decision follows the Supreme Court’s ruling in June that struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and required the federal government to recognize married same-sex couples in states that recognize same-sex marriage. Today’s decision expands on the ruling and recognizes all couples married in jurisdictions that recognize marriage equality.',\n",

       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which featured Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., delivering his historic “I Have a Dream” speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.“As we mark the 50th anniversary of the historic March on Washington, we recognize the tremendous progress our nation has made, both in the halls of our legislatures and in the hearts of our people. But the efforts to live up to Dr. King’s call to “make real the promises of democracy” continue. While the March on Washington is largely credited with inspiring the passage of the landmark Voting Right Act of 1965, we now face renewed threats to our fundamental right to vote. We do a disservice to the memories of Dr. King and Bayard Rustin if we do not protect against forces wishing to promote the rights of certain citizens while limiting those of others.“That is why I have introduced an amendment to the U.S. Constitution enshrining the right to vote. Passage of this amendment will mean that no matter who you are, where you live, or where you come from, every American would have the right to vote, and the ability to protect their individual rights and freedoms.

       "  'date': 'August 1, 2013',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-2) and Congresswoman Gwen Moore (WI-4) introduced legislation supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) runaway and homeless youth.The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA), last reauthorized in 2008 as the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act, is up for reauthorization this year. Currently, the legislation omits language relating to LGBT youth. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Inclusion Act (RHYIA) would help ensure that LGBT youth are not discriminated against and that grant recipients have the cultural competency to effectively serve these youth. In addition, RHYIA would take important steps to provide family support services for those struggling with the sexual orientation or gender identity of youth in their families.“I ran away from home when I was an adolescent,” said Rep. Moore. “It was the first and last time. Living on the streets is a difficult and dangerous experience – one that no child should have to endure. Unfortunately, homelessness is the reality for hundreds of thousands of youth each year. According to some studies, LGBT youth account for up to 40 percent of all homeless youth. LGBT homelessness is an issue that negatively impacts our children, our families and our communities. Omitting these young people from the RHYA sends a powerful message to this population: that addressing their trauma and fear is not a priority. The LGBT youth homelessness experience cannot be ignored.”LGBT youth are disproportionately represented in youth homelessness statistics. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Inclusion Act would require the Family and Youth Service Bureau to compile comprehensive data on the pervasiveness of LGBT youth homelessness.“Homelessness is one of the most pressing matters affecting LGBT youth,” Rep. Pocan said. “Young people in the LGBT community are disproportionately at-risk for homelessness, often as a result of the rejection, discrimination, or violence they face simply for being themselves. We have a moral responsibility to ensure that all of our youth, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, have access to life-saving services and safe, welcoming places to stay. By passing the reauthorization of an inclusive Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, we can begin to address this tragic problem and provide needed support to all of our young people in times of need.”“No young person should ever be homeless, let alone because they are gay or transgender, but when they are, we need to ensure that they are treated with dignity and respect when they seek help,” said Cyndi Lauper, Co-Founder of the True Colors Fund, which works to raise awareness about and help bring an end to LGBT youth homelessness. “I applaud Representatives Moore and Pocan for championing the Runaway and Homeless Youth Inclusion Act. Every young person, no matter who they are, deserves an even break and should never be turned away. If we want a strong future, we need to invest in all of our youth.”Representatives Moore and Pocan extend their thanks to current supporters of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Inclusion Act, including the following: Pathfinders, the True Colors Fund and the National Network 4 Youth.',\n",

       "  'date': 'July 25, 2013',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON— U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Charlie Rangel (D-NY) today introduced legislation, along with 100 bipartisan cosponsors, to ensure that gay and lesbian veterans who were discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation receive the honor and recognition they deserve. The \"Restore Honor to Service Members Act\" would instill the repeal of \"Don\\'t Ask Don\\'t Tell\" into law and support the Department of Defense\\'s efforts to correct the unfairly tarnished military records of our brave service members.  Since World War II to the repeal of \"Don\\'t Ask Don\\'t Tell\" in 2011, approximately 114,000 service members were discharged because of their sexual orientation.\"For too long, tens of thousands of men and women who selflessly risked their lives for our country have lived with the dishonorable records that came from the unjust \"Don\\'t Ask Don\\'t Tell\" policy,\" said Pocan, co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus.  \"But the support we have received for our legislation demonstrates the country\\'s strong desire to close the book on \"Don\\'t Ask Don\\'t Tell\" and rightfully recognize the service of all of our courageous service members. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to move forward with this effort and restore honor to all of our brave veterans.\"\"As an American, a Congressman, and a Korean War Veteran, I was proud to join my colleagues in ending the discriminatory law that previously barred open gay and lesbian soldiers from serving their country,\" said Rangel.  \"Now is the time to finish the job and ensure that all those who served honorably are recognized for their Honorable service regardless of their sexual orientation.\"The \"Restore Honor to Service Members Act\" is about more than upgrading a piece of paper. Every form of discharge previously given out prior to the repeal of \"Don\\'t Ask Don\\'t Tell\" carries with it consequences that can follow a service member for his or her entire life. While the characterization of the discharges varied, many members received discharges that were classified as \"other than honorable\" or \"dishonorable,\" particularly prior to the implementation of the \"Don\\'t Ask Don\\'t Tell\" policy in 1993.  In many states, a dishonorable discharge is treated as a felony, and service members receiving a \"general discharge,\" a lesser offense, can encounter grave difficulties acquiring civilian employment. All were barred from reenlisting in the military. Depending on the discharge received, service members may also be blocked from voting, unemployment benefits, participating in the GI Bill or receiving veteran benefits such as health care, VA disability, and ceremonial burial rights at military cemeteries. The \"Restore Honor to Service Members Act,\" turns the current broad review policy outlined in a memo from the Under Secretary of Defense into clear and settled law. It ensures all services members who were previously discharged because of their sexual orientation receive a timely, consistent and transparent review of their records so that gay veterans who served honorably have their records rightfully upgraded to honorable.  It also removes any indication of a service member\\'s sexual orientation from the record, so they are not automatically \"outed\" to those accessing their record and protects against future discrimination by decriminalizing consensual relations between same sex couples, bringing military law in line with Supreme Court rulings.Statements of Support for the Restore Honor to Service Members Act:\"American Veterans For Equal Rights (AVER) wholeheartedly endorses and supports the Restore Honor to Service Members Act,\" said Danny Ingram,President, American Veterans for Equal Rights.   \"Many thousands of LGBT service members were dishonorably discharged from WWII to 1994, prior to DADT, and thousands more under the DADT policy. Many elderly veterans urgently need access to the VA care which they are currently denied due to their discharges for being gay. The current process of discharge upgrades is extremely cumbersome and bureaucratic and can take over a decade in many cases. \"\"The repeal of ‘Don\\'t Ask, Don\\'t Tell\\' was a tremendous first step in achieving equality in our nation\\'s Armed Forces. It is important that we continue to address the discrimination that LGBT veterans face by updating their service records to reflect the reality of their service\" said HRC Legislative Director Allison Herwitt. \"We are thankful that Reps. Pocan (D-WI) and Rangel (D-NY) have addressed this issue with the \"Restore Honor to Service Members Act.\\'\"\"The September 2011 repeal of \\'Don\\'t ask, don\\'t tell\\' created a brighter future for our LGBT service members, allowing them to serve openly without fear of harsh professional repercussions.  But this victory for LGBT service members\\' future cannot undo the injuries of the past. Now, SWAN thanks U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan and Charlie Rangel for seeking to do just that, \" said Anu Bhagwati, Service Women\\'s Action Network executive director and former Marine Corps captain. \"The \\'Restore Honor to Service Members Act\\' closes the loop on this discriminatory policy: wiping out dishonorable characterizations tied to sexual orientation and restoring honor to those from whom it was unjustly taken.\" \"At OutServe-SLDN, we hear from these veterans every day and have assisted hundreds of them in applying to upgrade their discharge paperwork.  The process is arduous and slow.  There is no reason someone who courageously served or fought for their country yet is wrongfully discharged for being gay, should have to fight once again to have their service deemed \\'honorable.\\'  To the extent that this bill — or any bill — can expedite that process or ease the burden for veterans, it will have our support,\" said Zeke Stokes of OutServe-SLDN, an advocacy group for gay military personnel.###',\n",

ENDA has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and is a priority for Pocan and the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus.Despite significant progress for LGBT people and families in recent years there is still no explicit federal law that protects LGBT individuals from employment discrimination; ENDA would extend federal employment discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Currently only 17 states and the District of Columbia prohibit discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, while an additional four prohibit employment discrimination based only on sexual orientation. As a result, LGBT people face serious discrimination in employment, including being fired, being denied a promotion and experiencing harassment on the job.“As we have already seen this summer, the momentum toward full equality for all citizens is at full steam, and the Senate HELP committee’s bipartisan passage of ENDA only furthers this progress,” said Pocan. “No one should ever face discrimination in the workplace because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and this commonsense legislation will ensure all of our workers, no matter the state where they reside or who they choose to love, can feel safe in the work environment.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON– U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a co-chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus and the only current married gay member of Congress, today issued the following statement in response to the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and to dismiss the Prop 8 case on a lack of standing. As a result of today’s rulings, married same-sex couples in the states that recognize same-sex marriage will now also be recognized by the federal government and have access to federal rights, obligations and protections. However, because Pocan lives in Wisconsin, a state that does not recognize same-sex marriage, his marriage will not be affected by the Court’s ruling. By dismissing the Prop 8 case, thousands of same-sex couples in California that had previously been married can once again have their marriage recognized by the state.“I am overjoyed that the Supreme Court has come down on the side of equality, justice and love by striking down the Defense of Marriage Act,” Pocan said. “No more will thousands of loving gay and lesbian couples see their marriage ignored by the federal government, leaving them without the protections opposite-sex married couples enjoy. With 93 million Americans now living in states that recognize same-sex marriages, and 58 percent of the country in favor of marriage equality, we now have the public, the courts and the Constitution on our side. “I am also thrilled that by dismissing the Perry case, thousands of same-sex couples and families in California can once again have their love respected under the law, and Prop 8 can once again take its rightful place in our country’s history books.“As we celebrate this momentous occasion, we must continue to move forward and ensure all loving couples are treated as equals. While my husband Phil and I continue to wait to have our marriage recognized by both Wisconsin and Washington, I am now more confident than ever that full marriage equality is a question not of if, but when.”Pocan, a co-chair of the LGBT Equality Caucus, is the only current gay-married member of Congress.

So this month, let us take pride in who we are and who we love, and recommit to making our country a place that is built, as our Constitution mandates, on the fundamental tenets of justice and equality.”Pocan has been married to his husband Phil since 2006.###',\n",

Mark Pocan (WI-02) and the entire LGBT Equality Caucus (Equality Caucus) praised the re-introduction of the bipartisan Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The bill is sponsored by Representative Jared Polis (D-CO), a fellow Co-Chair of the Equality Caucus in the House, who is joined by Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) as the lead Republican sponsor.The Employment Non-Discrimination Act would establish basic protections in the workplace to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. There are still no explicit laws protecting employees from discrimination based on sexual orientation in 29 states and gender identity in 34 states. ENDA would provide a federal level of protection against workplace discrimination in a manner modeled closely on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and would apply to private employers as well as local, state, and federal government employers.Joining Representative Polis and Pocan in introducing ENDA as original co-sponsors were the four other Equality Caucus Co-Chairs and more than 150 original co-sponsors.“There is no room for discrimination – for any reason – in our laws, in our schools, and certainly not in our places of work,” said Rep. Mark Pocan. “Non-discrimination policies based on sexual orientation and gender identity are already in effect at a majority of our nation’s largest companies, and the time has come to ensure they are also passed into law. ENDA represents bipartisan, commonsense policy that guarantees all of our workers, no matter who they are or who they love, have the opportunity to thrive and succeed in the workforce.”---The mission of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus is to promote lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) equality. The bi-partisan LGBT Equality Caucus is strongly committed to achieving the full enjoyment of human rights for LGBT people in the U.S. and around the world. By serving as a resource for Members of Congress, their staff, and the public on LGBT issues, the Caucus works toward the extension of equal rights, the repeal of discriminatory laws, the elimination of hate-motivated violence, and the improved health and wellbeing for all regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity/expression.',\n",

I urge the Senate to pass this bill immediately and send it to President Biden’s desk.” This FY24 Minibus Appropriations bill will include a number of provisions benefiting Wisconsin’s 2nd Congressional District, including: $3,000,000 for The River Food Pantry to support the construction of a new food pantry facility that can serve over 13,000 people from low-income and underserved communities throughout Dane County.$1,396,913 for the Dane County Agricultural Digester to upgrade the filtration system to reduce agricultural-related runoff and improve the water quality of the Yahara Watershed.$1,119,365 for the Badger Prairie Needs Network Food Pantry to support the renovation of an existing food pantry facility to increase food storage capacity and add workspace to allow BPNN to meet increased demand for food assistance.$1,000,000 for the Green County Family YMCA to support a 50,000-square-foot expansion to the current facility.$1,000,000 for the Urban League Healthy Food Entrepreneurship Project to support the construction of a new space within the Black Business Hub to support BIPOC food entrepreneurs.$1,000,000 for UW-Madison Ag Research Infrastructure Improvements Project to support upgrades to outdated research facilities utilized by USDA Ag Research Service and University researchers.$963,000 for the UW-Madison PFAS Center of Excellence to upgrade analytical equipment that supports research in the University’s new Center of Excellence in PFAS Environmental Science.$800,000 for the Baraboo Boys & Girls Club to rehabilitate and repurpose an existing, underutilized building in Baraboo to serve as the new location for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Baraboo. $500,000 for the DeForest Windsor Fire & EMS Station No. 2 to support the construction of a new Fire and EMS Station to better ensure the public safety of the surrounding communities.$334,439 for the Evansville Highway-Rail Crossings Project to support improvements of the Madison Street and Main Street highway-rail grade crossings to improve safe passage and enhanced mobility for pedestrian and vehicle traffic in Evansville. $300,000 for the Southwest Tech Outreach Campus Land Acquisition to support land acquisition to serve as the site for a new multipurpose workforce education and training center to serve rural Southwest Wisconsin.$155,000 for the Lafayette County Sheriff’s Office to support the procurement of vital scanning equipment to improve the safety and security of individuals and staff at the county corrections facility.

Pocan looks forward to Wisconsin – and Wisconsin’s 2nd Congressional District – receiving the funding it needs and deserves.A full summary of the bill can be found here. Rep.

Instead, he and his Republican colleagues chose to engage in hostage-taking, refusing to raise the debt ceiling to avoid default unless paired with devastating cuts to essential government programs. While I am relieved the President and Democratic Leadership were able to walk back the worst of the Republicans’ demands, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I was unable to support this final agreement due to remaining unanswered questions.“This bill critically undercuts the appropriations process, one of the last processes in Washington where Democrats and Republicans work together. Severely restraining domestic spending while continuing to inflate unchecked defense spending for the Pentagon shows Republicans are not actually serious about addressing the deficit.\\xa0“With too many unanswered questions and unknown, undisclosed side deals, including a shortfall of $58 billion in promised domestic funding not explicitly guaranteed in the language of the bill for things like education, healthcare, and more, I could not, in good conscience, vote for this bill.\\xa0“In addition to my serious concerns about the impacts to the appropriations process and backroom deals, this bill expands SNAP work requirements for older Americans and threatens cash assistance for the lowest-income families, while simultaneously rescinding critical IRS investments intended to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. Moreover, this bill weakens key environmental and climate protections.\\xa0“While I am relieved that we will avoid an economic default, I remain steadfast that we never should have had to engage with an extreme MAGA Republican dominated caucus in hostage negotiations over Americans’ livelihoods to begin with. Looking forward, we should eliminate the unnecessary debt ceiling to avoid any question of the full faith and credit of the United States.”',\n",

This bill aims to prevent House Republicans from cutting Medicare and Social Security by raising the vote threshold to two-thirds in both the House and Senate for any legislation that would reduce benefits under either program.\"Medicare and Social Security are overwhelmingly popular for good reason – they provide critically important benefits to seniors and other vulnerable Americans. We all pay into both of these programs and are counting on them for essential healthcare and a dignified retirement,\" said Congressman Pocan. \"The Protect Social Security and Medicare Act will ensure that these benefits are protected from changes that lack widespread support.\"\"This legislation would ensure that Republicans are not permitted to fulfill Newt Gingrich\\'s desire of letting Social Security and Medicare ‘wither on the vine,\\' said Congressman Doggett. \"With the ongoing Republican attempt to use the debt limit to extract cuts, this bill offers added protection for fulfilling our promise that every American worker can retire with dignity and security.\" \"For millions of seniors and working people across Florida, Social Security and Medicare are a lifeline that means the difference between having the financial support and healthcare you need to live, or going without,\" said Rep.

The Washington Post described the GOP plans to rob seniors as \"deeply unpopular.\" The Protect Social Security and Medicare Act aims to ensure that these benefits are protected from such cuts.Endorsed by Social Security Works, the Protect Social Security and Medicare Act requires a two-thirds supermajority vote to pass any legislation that would reduce benefits under either program, protecting seniors\\' safety net from changes that lack widespread support.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – As we enter the second month of the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period, U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Ro Khanna (CA-17), and Jan Schakowsky (IL-09) are reintroducing the \"Save Medicare Act.\" This bill renames so-called \"Medicare Advantage\" plans, prohibits private insurers from using \"Medicare\" in plan titles or advertisements, and imposes significant fines for any insurer that engages in this deceptive practice. Many cable news watchers have been inundated with commercials for private healthcare plans during this open enrollment period. Because of that, Reps. Pocan, Khanna, and Schakowsky filmed a videoexplaining why Medicare Advantage is not Medicare. \"Only Medicare is Medicare. It is one of the most popular and important services the government provides,\" Rep. Pocan said. \"These non-Medicare plans run by private insurers undermine traditional Medicare. They often leave patients without the benefits they need while overcharging the federal government for corporate profit. This bill eliminates any confusion about what is – and what is not – Medicare, and ensures this essential program will continue to serve seniors and other Americans for years to come.\"\"It\\'s time to call out ‘Medicare Advantage\\' for what it is: private insurance that profits by denying coverage and the name is being used to trick seniors into enrolling. That\\'s not right,\" said Rep. Khanna. \"This bill will end the scam by preventing private insurers from profiting off the Medicare brand. Our focus should be on strengthening and expanding real Medicare.\"\"Do not be fooled, Medicare Advantage is not Medicare. I am extremely concerned about the deceptive advertisements that Medicare Advantage plans are using to trick older Americans into signing up for plans that may not cover the care they need. Not only are Medicare Advantage plans denying requests for much-needed care, but they are also falsifying medical records to make seniors appear sicker than they are so the plans can line their own pockets with taxpayer dollars,\" said Rep. Schakowsky. \"The Save Medicare Act, which I am proud to introduce with Congressman Pocan and Congressman Khanna, will help us put an end to the false advertising and will show the American people that these plans are scams.\"\"So-called Medicare Advantage is neither Medicare nor an advantage,\" said Wendell Potter, President of the Center for Health and Democracy. \"It is simply another scheme by the insurance companies to line their pockets at the expense of consumers. I applaud Congressman Pocan and Congressman Khanna for introducing this vital legislation. The health care market is confusing for consumers and misleading branding like so-called Medicare Advantage just makes it worse.\"\"Medicare is a national treasure, delivering real value to millions of older adults and people with disabilities,\" Diane Archer, President of Just Care USA said. \"Corporate insurance plans too often lean on Medicare\\'s good name to mislead people into signing up with them. Rep. Pocan and Rep. Khanna\\'s bill would put an end to this practice.\"\"Signing up for the right Medicare coverage is a nightmare right now, a complex and tangled maze of choices,\" Alex Lawson, Executive Director of Social Security Works said. \"The real problem is that a bunch of these choices aren\\'t Medicare at all. They are private insurance companies preying on seniors and people with disabilities. Unlike actual Medicare, these plans deny and delay care — because that\\'s what for-profit insurance always does. These corporate insurance plans should not be able to lie about who and what they are by calling themselves Medicare anything.\" \"Private health insurers drive up costs and deny care to people who need it, and calling what they\\'re up to ‘Medicare Advantage\\' doesn\\'t change that fact,\" People\\'s Action Director Sulma Arias said. \"This bill by Reps. Pocan, Khanna, and Schakowsky will stop these scams. The people organizing through our Our Health Care for All campaign are proud to support the Save Medicare Act. We need our elected officials to focus on expanding real Medicare to everyone, not lending its branding to greedy corporations.\"According to a New York Times article published in October, \"8 of the 10 largest Medicare Advantage insurers – representing more than two-thirds of the market – have submitted inflated bills…and four of the five largest players – United Health, Humana, Elevance, and Kaiser – have faced federal lawsuits alleging that efforts to overdiagnose their customers crossed the line into fraud.\"Additionally, according to the federal Medicare Payment Advisory Commission\\'s2022 report to Congress, at least $12 billion in overpayments were made to Medicare Advantage plans in 2020 by the federal government.  The \"Save Medicare Act\" will eliminate the confusion private insurers have relied upon for years to enroll unsuspecting seniors, and restore true Medicare as the primary health plan older Americans rely on.

President Trump is planning to host his first large rally since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic this Saturday at an indoor arena in Tulsa, OK. The Trump campaign is requiring all attendees to sign liability waivers due to the high likelihood of contracting COVID-19.\"Since the beginning of this pandemic, the President has refused to take ownership over his administration\\'s disastrous response to COVID-19,\" said Congressman Pocan. \"As we see cases continue to rise—including over 300 new cases in Tulsa County over the last week alone—this President wants the right to endanger thousands of people at an indoor stadium with impunity. We refuse to let a candidate for re-election threaten the lives of the people of this country for political gain. With over 2 million COVID cases in the United States and over 116,000 deaths, I would hope this president\\'s actions would prioritize recovery, not a resurgence in cases nationwide.\"Congressman Pocan previously wrote to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield last week, asking whether he believes states and localities should permit large indoor public events like the rally, attended by thousands of participants not practicing recommended social distancing or face-covering practices—particularly if organizers require liability waivers to attend due to the likelihood of contracting COVID-19. In the absence of a response from the CDC, the Congressman introduced the RALLIES Act to prevent the president from evading accountability for his dangerous actions.See the text of the RALLIES Act here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI—This morning, Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) sent a letter to Peter Gaynor, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator, detailing continued problems with the amount and usability of medical and testing supplies FEMA has delivered to Wisconsin. FEMA\\'s support is critical to Wisconsin\\'s ability to respond to the coronavirus. But, without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and supplies from the federal government, Wisconsin will be left even more vulnerable in the face of this global pandemic that has already taken the lives of over 100,000 Americans.\"This administration turned its back on the people of Wisconsin early on in this pandemic,\" said Congressman Mark Pocan. \"First, the Trump administration failed to get our state the supplies it needs to expand testing and protect our communities. Then, when they finally get us supplies, they send many that are unusable for the pandemic. This pattern of apparent negligence from the top has a human cost and our state cannot tolerate this administration\\'s incompetence any longer.\"\"President Trump has not provided Wisconsin all the medical supplies we have requested,\" said Senator Tammy Baldwin. \"Shortchanging Wisconsin and sending us unusable medical supplies is simply not acceptable and it\\'s not going to help our state move forward. The President\\'s mismanagement of the medical supply chain throughout this pandemic is just one of the many failures of this administration\\'s response to the public health crisis we continue to face. This White House needs deliver the medical supplies Wisconsin desperately needs to shut down this pandemic, safely reopen our economy and put people back to work.\"There were systematic problems in late March and April with getting supplies to Wisconsin. There appeared to be a renewed interest, specifically from FEMA, in getting supplies to the states in later April, but according to actual records of items received, the problems continue.Most recently, Governor Tony Evers laid out the supplies that state needed in an April 30 letter to FEMA. Almost a month later, we\\'ve received only about 22% of what we have requested—including zero surgical gowns.Even when Wisconsin has received supplies from FEMA, some of the most critical materials have been completely unusable. 17,000 saline tubes are too short to transport the nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs used for the majority of COVID-19 tests, and 67,983 foam applicators that cannot be used for NP swabs either.\"We still are not getting the supplies we need in the quantities necessary to fight Covid-19,\" continued Congressman Pocan. \"And too often, when we received supplies, they weren\\'t usable for the purposes required. More than 60 days into a national emergency, these mistakes cannot continue to be made – they will cost human lives.\"In some cases, confusion has been the major problem. The federal government has failed to provide adequate supplies for our state\\'s clinical and private labs—paralyzing our ability to expand testing capacity statewide. Originally, FEMA was the procurer of tests and the reagents needed to run them, then it became the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but during that shift the majority of labs in the state were refused help. The majority of labs conducting COVID-19 tests in Wisconsin are clinical or private labs experiencing severe shortages of reagents, yet this administration refuses to supply those reagents.\"FEMA has been very helpful in setting up testing facilities in several parts of Wisconsin which has been appreciated,\" noted Congressman Pocan. \"But this far into the pandemic, we need far quicker and more robust help in getting PPE, reagents and other supplies to Wisconsin and the rest of the nation. That\\'s the real emergency management we need from this White House.\"See the full letter, including side-by-side comparisons of supplies requested by the Governor and received from FEMA here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI—Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) and Charlie Crist (D-FL) will be introducing the COVID-19 Emergency Production Act tomorrow. The bill allows, by a vote of Congress, to force the President to use the Defense Production Act (DPA). Specifically, it requires him to use the DPA to designate PPE, all testing supplies and any future COVID-19 vaccine as critical material essential to the national defense. It would direct materials to be produced and distributed to states and territories based on their requests for supplies and in proportion to their populations.The first COVID-19 case in America was reported on January 20, but four months later states and hospitals are still reporting shortages of critical supplies like personal protective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19 tests due to this administration\\'s failure to act on a national level to combat this pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note that we have tested less than 4% of our country\\'s population and 13% of those we have tested have come back positive. The President has refused to use the full force of the Defense Production Act to combat this crisis on the grand scale it demands. We need to massively ramp up our testing and supply production to support the states and hospitals that have repeatedly requested them.\"The President\\'s complete failure to respond to this crisis in a national manner has led to over 1.5 million cases and over 90,000 deaths in the country,\" said Congressman Pocan. \"For months, states have begged for additional testing supplies and PPE and received crumbs from this administration in response. We cannot reopen states without expanding testing capacity nationwide—it\\'s just that simple. This president has refused to act as a leader and instead delights in states competing for scarce supplies. Our nation won\\'t survive without national action.\"\"For the country to reopen and recover, we need a strong strategy that will ensure testing supplies and PPE are available to everyone that needs it,\" said Congresswoman Blunt Rochester. \"But we must also put a plan in place to ensure we will be ready and able to produce and efficiently distribute a future vaccine. This bill will not only solve the real shortages experienced today, it will allow the President to use the Defense Production Act proactively to encourage the right investments and developments that so the issues with PPE and testing don\\'t affect vaccine deployment. The health and safety of our communities are depending on us all to work together and get America back on track.\"    \"We still don\\'t have enough tests for everyone who wants one and our hospitals, health agencies, and first responders continue to compete with each other and the rest of the world for personal protective equipment. All 50 states are in some stage of reopening, and shortages will get worse if we see another spike,\" said Congressman Crist. \"Everybody should have access to testing; every worker should have the PPE they need to do their jobs safely; and eventually, everyone should be able to get a vaccine. If the President won\\'t use his authority under the Defense Production Act to get Americans what we need to beat this virus, Congress must step in and require it.\"See the full text of the bill here.###',\n",

Now more than ever, in the middle of a global pandemic, we cannot allow this ballooning spending to be directed towards this president\\'s warmongering. Over 90,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, and we must focus our spending efforts on the expansion of testing, contact tracing, treatment, vaccine development and relief for the people of this country. Last year\\'s NDAA authorized $738 billion in defense spending for FY20, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) got 1/90th of that: less than $8 billion.\"We are facing a crisis in this country and billions of dollars in defense spending increases won\\'t solve it,\" said Congressman Pocan. \"Year after year, we see taxpayer dollars line the pocket of defense contractors instead of supporting the American public. The enemy we\\'re fighting right now is COVID-19, so our sole focus should be on expanding testing, tracing and treatment, funding towards vaccine development, and relief for the American people. Increasing defense spending now would be a slap in the face to the families of over 90,000 Americans that have died from this virus.\"\"Year after year, the Pentagon budget has inflated to historic levels while the vital needs of everyday people are left unmet,\" said Congresswoman Lee. \"The COVID pandemic has laid bare how America has failed to make its budgets reflect the real needs of our everyday families. It\\'s long past time that we address our bloated military budget and retarget resources towards policies and programs that matter the most for keeping us safe, healthy, and secure.\"Last year\\'s House NDAA passed out of the House of Representatives in July with zero Republican votes and eight Democratic \"NO\" votes—both Pocan and Lee voted against last year\\'s defense spending increase. Republicans withstanding, 19 Democrats would need to vote \"NO\" this year for the bill to fail. 29 Democrats signed this letter.This letter was co-signed by Representatives Blumenauer (D-OE), Cohen (D-TN), DeFazio (D-OR), DeGette (D-CO), Espaillat (D-NY), Evans (D-PA), J.

       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI —Today, Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (CT-03) announced they will introduce two bills to prevent working people from being laid off due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Preventing Layoffs During a Public Health Emergency Act and the Layoff Prevention Act would provide federal support for states\\' work sharing programs, which give employers the flexibility they need to maintain their workforce and keep American workers on the job. Struggling companies will be able to reduce hours instead of their workforce—helping them save on rehiring costs—while employees will keep their jobs and receive a portion of Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits to make up for lost wages.DeLauro championed these provisions during the financial crisis and secured inclusion of parts of the Layoff Prevention Act in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. By 2016, work sharing programs were established in 29 states, including Connecticut. However, the federal financing and grants lapsed in August 2015 despite DeLauro\\'s efforts to extend them.\"Businesses are closing and people are losing their jobs right now because of the coronavirus pandemic,\" said Congresswoman DeLauro. \"Working people and families are facing an unprecedented threat to their economic security, and many do not know how they are going to be able to put food on the table and pay their bills. Fortunately, Congress can help make a difference in people\\'s lives right now. By expanding federal support for work sharing programs, workers would be able to keep their jobs and companies can avert layoffs and costly rehiring. Moreover, with fewer workers unemployed, there is less of a burden on the Unemployment Insurance benefits system—which is currently being strained in many states. Work sharing programs were a bright spot in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and we should immediately reinstate federal support for them in the next coronavirus response package.\"\"Work sharing is one of the most impactful tools we can utilize to reduce widespread layoffs nationally during this pandemic,\" said Congressman Pocan. \"A public health emergency doesn\\'t mean we have to leave small businesses to face this crisis alone. More than half of all states already have work sharing programs that give small businesses and their workers the flexibility to reduce employee hours while allowing workers to collect partial unemployment insurance to compensate for lower hours. At a time when workers live in fear of losing their next paycheck, we must do everything in our power to protect their livelihoods.\"DeLauro serves as Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Labor, and Pocan serves as a Member of the Subcommittee.Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) has introduced companion legislation in the Senate.',\n",

We have an obligation to do everything we can to keep them afloat during this unprecedented crisis,\" Congressman Cicilline said. \"As Congress works to provide additional emergency funding in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it\\'s crucial that we take steps to provide direct assistance to small businesses.\"The letter was also co-signed by Representatives: Lisa Blunt Rochester (DE), Suzanne Bonamici (OR), André Carson (IN) , Yvette D.

As you develop a third legislative package in response to the coronavirus outbreak, we encourage you to include additional, immediate, and direct financial assistance to America\\'s millions of small businesses, independent contractors, sole proprietors, and gig economy workers.The initial House-passed coronavirus measures included strong first steps to begin to ensure many workers are provided the resources they need to survive lost wages during this time. Unfortunately, the tax credits offered to impacted employers are unlikely to address the revenue loss that will occur in the coming months. Small business enterprises will struggle to pay rent, service existing debt, cover utilities, continue to pay insurance, and meet the myriad other expenses they face.As Congress moves toward a third coronavirus legislative package, we encourage the inclusion of direct cash assistance to cover lost expenses during a time of forced closure or limited operations that is on a scale consistent with the cash assistance likely to be provided to workers soon. We are pleased that policy discussions for the initial coronavirus packages focused on workers, but we fear that if small business concerns aren\\'t addressed in the near-term workers may not have jobs to return to when this pandemic ends. We also believe that small business interests are just as deserving of assistance as large business interests, particularly when they are far more likely to have paid a larger relative share of their income in federal taxes.We thank you for your consideration of these views and look forward to continuing to work with you on behalf of America\\'s workers, independent contractors, sole proprietors, gig economy workers, and small business community.',\n",

EsperSecretary of DefenseUnited States of America1000 Defense PentagonWashington, DC  20301Dear Secretary Esper:Global pandemics know no boundaries, neither should responses to them.  For that reason, I write to inquire about the Department of Defense's (DOD) preparedness and response planning for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Domestically, America's response to COVID-19 has been disturbing.  The severity of the threat has been underestimated and understated from the beginning; and, as a result, the Administration has proven incapable of developing a coherent strategy to combat the disease.In times such as this, it is imperative that every American receive the care they need.  That is especially true for our servicemembers who will inevitably be called upon to assist in the global response to COVID-19.  Unfortunately, however, I have been told that there are members of our military stationed in Afghanistan who have flu-like symptoms, have tested negative for the flu, and are being denied testing for COVID-19.  If true, this is deeply distressing and must be remedied immediately.  Senior military officials who travel from installation to installation may be unknowingly contributing to the spread of COVID-19 among servicemembers serving in some of the most vulnerable regions of the world.Therefore, I wish to know the following:Does DOD have COVID-19 tests?If so, how many?How many tests can DOD labs process per day?Can any servicemember who wishes to be tested for COVID-19 receive a test?Has any servicemember who has requested a test for COVID-19 been denied a test for COVID-19?If so, how many?How many COVID-19 tests are available to servicemembers stationed abroad?How many COVID-19 tests are available to servicemembers stationed in Afghanistan?How many servicemembers currently have COVID-19?How many servicemembers have been quarantined because of COVID-19 concerns or exposure?Because sample specimens taken as part of COVID-19 test collections typically degrade beyond many labs' testing capabilities within 72 hours, how many servicemembers would currently be unable to have a collected sample tested for COVID-19 within 72 hours of collection?What new Defense-wide procedures have you implemented in response to COVID-19?What is the implementation date for each of the procedures listed in response to the previous question?Is DOD concerned about any possible drug shortage during this COVID-19 outbreak?If so, what steps are being taken to address those concerns?What medical supplies and medical care capacity (such as medical care facilities, hospitals, isolation units, intensive care beds, etc.) for servicemembers do you anticipate will be most stressed during this pandemic?Finally, how much additional funding do you anticipate requesting from Congress in order to adequately respond to threats posed by COVID-19?I appreciate your immediate attention to this matter, and encourage you to publicly announce to all servicemembers, including their families, the COVID-19 procedures you have established and the level of care they can expect to receive.  Given the seriousness of this inquiry, I request a response to the questions contained in this letter in no less than 48 hours.\",\n",

EsperSecretary of DefenseUnited States of America1000 Defense PentagonWashington, DC  20301Dear Secretary Esper:Global pandemics know no boundaries, neither should responses to them.  For that reason, I write to inquire about the Department of Defense's (DOD) preparedness and response planning for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Domestically, America's response to COVID-19 has been disturbing.  The severity of the threat has been underestimated and understated from the beginning; and, as a result, the Administration has proven incapable of developing a coherent strategy to combat the disease.In times such as this, it is imperative that every American receive the care they need.  That is especially true for our servicemembers who will inevitably be called upon to assist in the global response to COVID-19.  Unfortunately, however, I have been told that there are members of our military stationed in Afghanistan who have flu-like symptoms, have tested negative for the flu, and are being denied testing for COVID-19.  If true, this is deeply distressing and must be remedied immediately.  Senior military officials who travel from installation to installation may be unknowingly contributing to the spread of COVID-19 among servicemembers serving in some of the most vulnerable regions of the world.Therefore, I wish to know the following:Does DOD have COVID-19 tests?If so, how many?How many tests can DOD labs process per day?Can any servicemember who wishes to be tested for COVID-19 receive a test?Has any servicemember who has requested a test for COVID-19 been denied a test for COVID-19?If so, how many?How many COVID-19 tests are available to servicemembers stationed abroad?How many COVID-19 tests are available to servicemembers stationed in Afghanistan?How many servicemembers currently have COVID-19?How many servicemembers have been quarantined because of COVID-19 concerns or exposure?Because sample specimens taken as part of COVID-19 test collections typically degrade beyond many labs' testing capabilities within 72 hours, how many servicemembers would currently be unable to have a collected sample tested for COVID-19 within 72 hours of collection?What new Defense-wide procedures have you implemented in response to COVID-19?What is the implementation date for each of the procedures listed in response to the previous question?Is DOD concerned about any possible drug shortage during this COVID-19 outbreak?If so, what steps are being taken to address those concerns?What medical supplies and medical care capacity (such as medical care facilities, hospitals, isolation units, intensive care beds, etc.) for servicemembers do you anticipate will be most stressed during this pandemic?Finally, how much additional funding do you anticipate requesting from Congress in order to adequately respond to threats posed by COVID-19?I appreciate your immediate attention to this matter, and encourage you to publicly announce to all servicemembers, including their families, the COVID-19 procedures you have established and the level of care they can expect to receive.  Given the seriousness of this inquiry, I request a response to the questions contained in this letter in no less than 48 hours.\",\n",

Former FDA Commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, has explained that labs in the United States currently only have the capacity to process about 17,000 patients a day. That means that with the current supply of test kits for 989,000 people, it would take over 58 days to process just these tests. New info from the CDC indicates they may be able to double their processing capacity soon, however that still means it could potentially take almost a month to process tests. That is a huge problem.\"The administration must stop misinforming the public on their capacity to test patients in the United States. We demand the administration provide us with the full capacity numbers for labs in the United States as well.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (February 7, 2019) – U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Marcy Kaptur (OH-09) today introduced legislation that would penalize pharmaceutical companies that engage in price gouging without cause, leading to price spikes for patients who rely on medication to treat diseases ranging from cancer to addiction. The Stop Price Gouging Act, would hold drug companies accountable for large price increases and result in billions of dollars in savings for taxpayers. U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) are introducing companion legislation in the Senate.The Stop Price Gouging Act would:Require drug companies to report increases in drug prices, and justify the increase.Penalize drug companies that engage in unjustified price increases with financial penalties proportionate to the price spike.\"Despite President Trump claiming victory on declining prescription drug prices, the costs of many drugs are still skyrocketing and becoming increasingly unaffordable for millions of Americans,\" said Pocan. \"The Stop Price Gouging Act will hold corporations accountable and protect consumers from egregious year-after-year price spikes that are far too common. While American families struggle over whether to pay an electric bill or buy life-saving medications, drug manufacturers and CEOs should not be making excessive profits. Members of Congress should immediately support this legislation and deliver results for the American people who are being hit with outrageous drug prices daily.\"\"We must stand up to pharmaceutical companies that are more worried about lining their own pockets and bolstering profits for Wall Street investors than making sure patients can access the life-saving medications they produce,\" said Kaptur. \"As policymakers, we must shine a light on price gouging. The predatory pricing practice must stop. The health and well-being of millions of Americans depends on it.\"\"The purpose of medicine is to help people, not to line the pockets of Big Pharma executives. Too many hardworking Americans still struggle to afford the medicine they need, and often, the culprit is price gouging by big pharmaceutical corporations. It has to stop. The Stop Price Gouging Act would protect Ohioans from prescription drug price spikes by requiring drug companies to report and justify their decisions to increase prices and prevent big pharma from price gouging,\" said Brown.\"Too many New Yorkers are suffering because drug companies care more about their own profits than whether sick patients have access to medicine. That is one of the root causes of our country\\'s skyrocketing prescription drug costs, and Congress needs to step in and solve this problem now,\" said Gillibrand. \"This urgently needed legislation would finally hold companies accountable and penalize them when they gouge the price of a prescription drug without cause. I am proud to introduce this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in fighting to pass it.\"Under current law, pharmaceutical corporations can increase the price of their products without justification. Pocan and Kaptur introduced this bill last Congress and said they would continue fighting to pass it this session of Congress. Any revenues collected through the Stop Price Gouging Act would be reinvested in future drug research and development at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).In 2018, Americans spent an all-time high of $360 billion on prescription drugs. Nearly one-third of Americans polled by Consumer Reports said they had experienced a drug price hike in the past year, shelling out a total of $2 billion more for a drug they routinely take. Their 2016 survey revealed that 30 percent of Americans who experienced a hike in the price of one or more of their medications in the past year left a prescription unfilled because it was too expensive; 15 percent said they cut pills in half to make them last longer.###',\n",

This rate increase is a direct result of the Trump Administration refusing to guarantee that the federal government will continue cost-sharing reduction payments.The Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner required insurance companies to submit rates based on the assumption that the federal government will discontinue these payments, rather than make them as required by current law. As a result of President Trump\\'s threats, in Dane County, the 2nd lowest cost silver plan will increase by an average of 60.54%, from $219.75 to $352.78.\"President Trump is doing everything he can to sabotage the ACA and his actions are now having a very real impact on tens of thousands of Wisconsinites. With premiums jumping 36 percent, President Trump\\'s threats to discontinue cost-sharing reduction payments are sending the insurance markets into chaos and costing Wisconsin families hundreds of dollars every month. President Trump has never cared about working men and women, and with these rate increases, it is clearer than ever that he is actively working to hurt them.

Earlier this month Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced a Senate version of the bill.\"In the last year, 28 million Americans saw a price spike for the drugs they take and 4 million of them had to stop taking their prescription because drug manufacturer raised the price so high they could no longer afford the medicine,\" said Congressman Pocan. \"This legislation is crucially needed to protect Americans from drug manufacturers making an excessive profit off of Americans need for life-saving medications.

In recent years, America has witnessed a rapid increase in prescription drug costs. Between 2010 and 2014, thirty common pharmaceuticals experienced an average price increase of approximately 76 percent. These massive price increases have had an inordinate impact on the elderly and most seniors cannot absorb the price shock of rapidly rising drug prices. This situation has left Medicare and in turn taxpayers on the hook.Specifically, the bill does the following:Requires pharmaceutical corporations to report any increases in the price of their products, as well as justification for any increases that exceed medical inflation, to the public.Imposes a penalty on corporations that engage in excessive, unjustified price increases that is proportional to the size of the price spike.Instructs the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study examining how drug manufacturers establish initial launch prices and suggest best practices for monitoring new drug pricing; andReinvests revenues collected from companies will be invested in future drug research and development at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).House bill is endorsed by Public Citizen, Social Security Works, Center for Medicare Advocacy, Daily Kos, Families USA, Knowledge Ecology International, and Universities Allied for Essential Medicines###',\n",

Pocan said. “This bill reaffirms our commitment to help early career researchers and young innovators pursue their research and ensures the U.S. continues to be the global leader in science research and development. With one of the country’s greatest research universities in my own District, I have heard directly from graduate researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison about the need for investment, coordination and promotion of policies focused on the future of the research workforce in the United States. By providing our young scientists and researchers with more funding opportunities and focused policies they have the support necessary to tackling the challenges of tomorrow. I want to thank Senator Baldwin for her work on this initiative and the countless advocates who worked to get this legislation passed.”The legislation authorizes NIH to establish a “Next Generation of Researchers Initiative” within the NIH Office of the Director to develop and coordinate policies and programs related to young scientists, such as funding opportunities, training and mentorship programs, and policies to enhance workforce diversity. It also funds a study by the National Academies of Science to review career barriers for biomedical researchers, which the NIH will subsequently use to continue to focus and pursue effectively policies promoting the future of the research workforce.\"We are deeply grateful to Congressman Pocan for his dedication and leadership in advancing the 21st Century Cures Act, which includes the Next Generation Researchers Act, which he authored to ensure that we continue our progress in biomedical research,\" said Robert Golden, Dean of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. \"This legislation provides critical support for the development of young researchers, many of whom are working on new cures and therapies right here in Wisconsin.”“As a world class research institution, UW-Madison is home to many researchers who are early in their careers and can benefit from the passage of the Next Generation of Researchers Initiative in the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We are extremely grateful to Representative Pocan for introducing this legislation and shepherding it through bipartisan approval as an investment in the next generation of researchers,” said Marsha Mailick, UW-Madison’s Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education. “Our researchers in the growing biomedical and behavioral research areas are eager for opportunities like this initiative, which seeks to enhance training, provide mentorship programs, and jump start much needed funding for those early in their careers who have great potential to conduct transformative research at UW-Madison.”“Ensuring young researchers have opportunities to pursue their dreams and contribute to faster medical progress is crucial to sustaining our global competitiveness in the life sciences arena, and to the national imperative of faster medical progress,” said Mary Wooley, President and CEO of Research!

       "  'date': 'October 12, 2016',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) along with 33 House Democrats, sent a letter to President Obama urging him to take executive action to reign in the dramatic increase in costs for prescription medications. In the letter, the members note that since 2011, prices for four of the nation’s top 10 drugs rose more than 100 percent and the cost of the other six most commonly used prescription medications went up more than 50 percent. These price hikes are restricting and preventing Americans’ access to critical drugs.“Americans deserve reliable access to safe and affordable prescription drugs. While drug company profits continue to increase at a faster pace than any other sector of the health care industry, too many working families are being squeezed by skyrocketing drug prices,” Rep. Pocan said. “The President should use his executive authority to end pharmaceutical companies’ monopoly on drug pricing and ensure that Americans don’t have to worry about how they will pay for lifesaving prescriptions.”\"Drug prices are too high, forcing millions of Americans to choose between their financial health and their physical health. But, as Rep. Pocan and the signers of his letter point out, President Obama can take executive action to lower drug prices,” said Alex Lawson, Executive Director, Social Security Works. “We urge him to do so immediately.\"A recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that almost 75% of Americans believe drug costs are unreasonable and a majority of Americans (including Republicans) support a variety of government actions to limit pharmaceutical companies increasing drug prices to benefit their own bottom line.The letter was signed by Reps. Keith Ellison (D-MN), Raúl M. Grijalva (D-AZ), Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Nydia Velázquez (D-NY), Jim McDermott (D-WA), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Jared Huffman (D-CA), Luis Gutiérrez (D-IL), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Sam Farr (D-CA), Gwen S.

The text of the letter is below and a signed copy can be found here.Dear President Obama: We write to express our concern regarding the dramatic increase in costs for prescription medications and commend your continued commitment to decreasing the costs of health care without reducing quality for millions of Americans. In fact, the Affordable Care Act has reduced the rate of uninsured Americans to below 9 percent, the lowest rate on record. However, the federal government has yet to seriously address the alarming rise in the price of prescription drugs, which makes up nearly 20 percent of total health care costs in the United States. We urge your administration to use executive action and take concrete steps now to enable more Americans have access to affordable prescription drugs.In the past five years, patients have seen multiple pharmaceutical corporations participate in the cruel practice of price gouging: preventing Americans from accessing lifesaving drugs in order to maximize their profits.  Recently, Gilead Sciences set a price of $84,000 for Solvaldi, their 12-week Hepatitis C treatment, restricting patient access to the life-changing drug in order to maximize their profits. Additionally, Turing Pharmaceuticals, which purchased Daraprim, a drug used to treat a rare disease and AIDS patients, drastically hiked the price by 5,000 percent from $13.50 to $750 per pill. Unfortunately, Turing is not alone. Pharmaceutical corporations are buying rights to older drugs with limited competition in the market and then quickly increasing prices several times over a short period of time. The most recent example of the pharmaceutical industries’ price-gouging and anti-competitive behavior is Mylan Pharmaceuticals. Mylan increased the price of the EpiPen, an auto-injector of epinephrine for patients with severe allergies who are at-risk of anaphylaxis, by over 480 percent in the United States over 5 years. This practice has restricted families’ and emergency medical providers’ access to this lifesaving product. Unfortunately, the tactics used by pharmaceutical companies have an outsized impact on low- and middle-income families and seniors. We have all heard too many stories from our constituents about families who are forced to choose between buying groceries, paying their mortgage or getting medication their child desperately needs. Since 2011, prices for four of the nation’s top 10 drugs rose more than 100 percent and the other six went up more than 50 percent. Pharmaceutical companies are restricting, or even worse, preventing Americans’ access to critical drugs for the sake of their own profits. As Congress pursues multiple legislative strategies aimed at ending the pharmaceutical price gouging behavior, we also urge you engage in efforts to address this through executive action. With continued Republican obstruction of necessary legislation, we need your leadership to prevent harm to millions of families hurt by soaring prices for the medicines they need.We believe your Administration should issue fair and transparent guidelines to ensure the public has access to lifesaving drugs developed using federally funded research. Specifically, you should instruct the Director of the National Institutes of Health to ensure that drugs researched and developed with taxpayer funds are kept accessible to the public by authorizing new competition for unaffordable, monopoly-priced medications—an existing statutory power granted by the Bayh-Dole Act (Pub. L. 96-517). This is an important step in deterring corporations from holding federally funded patented drugs from setting unreasonable prices.Moreover, we also encourage your administration to explore implementing drug importation rules that are already part of U.S. law. Under authority from the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, the Secretary of Health and Human Services can certify the importation of prescription drugs from other countries under specific qualifications. This regulatory action would pose no risk to public health and safety and could result in a significant reduction in the cost of prescription drugs to American families. We believe your administration also has the authority to address issues within the Federal Trade Commission to more effectively combat monopolies held by pharmaceutical companies and the use of patent settlements to block all other generic drug competition for a growing number of branded drugs, also known as “pay-for-delay.” We are deeply concerned that pharmaceutical companies will continue this unethical and unlawful practice until necessary reforms are developed and implemented. In any given month, about half of all Americans and 90 percent of seniors take a prescription drug. We strongly encourage you to consider these executive actions to stop the rapid increase in drug prices and ensure affordable consumer access to medication.',\n",

The Ryan White HIV/AIDS program provides medical care for people living with HIV/AIDS who do not have adequate health coverage or resources to cope with the disease. Part C clinics deliver quality, comprehensive HIV/AIDs care to over 275,000 people a year. These clinics, which serve a large number of uninsured and low-income individuals, are underfunded and in desperate need of increased resources in order to assist patients.The HIV Clinical Services Improvement Act, introduced in the Senate by Senator Tammy Baldwin, authorizes all Part C clinics to be eligible for enhanced Medicaid funding and allows Part C clinics to expand their operations to care for the growing number of vulnerable HIV/AIDs population. Since 2001, the number of Part C clinics has increased by 74 percent, while funding only increased by 8 percent highlighting the need for improved support for these clinics.\"Improving access to health care for people living with HIV/AIDS in our communities is critical,\" said Rep.

But we aren\\'t going to repeal health insurance for 140,000 Wisconsinites and we are not going back to the days when insurance companies could drop your coverage because you get sick, get older, or have a baby. We aren\\'t going back to the days when insurance companies were charging whatever they want when you get sick and jacking up premiums and deductibles because of a preexisting condition. We are going to move heath care reform forward because the American people deserve to know their coverage will be there when they need it most.\"\"My goal is that all Dane County residents – without exception -- have quality, affordable health care,\" Dane County Executive Joe Parisi said. \"I am grateful to our staff and volunteers who are helping people sign up for health insurance coverage at locations throughout Dane County, including our Dane County Job Center. I urge our community to help spread the word that now is the time to sign up for health insurance during open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act.\"\"Great Progress that about 10 million more people have insurance now than a year ago,\" said Region V HHS Director Kathleen Falk. \"But there are still many uninsured in the Dane County area. Surveys show a majority of the uninsured do not know there is this important opportunity for them to obtain affordable, quality health care from now until February 15 – with the need to purchase by December 15 for coverage to start January 1. And we encourage people who enrolled last year to shop again this year because there are even more insurers to choose from in Wisconsin.\"\"The Affordable Care Act has greatly improved my life. My best health care insurance option used to be almost twice what my premium is now,\" said Oma Vic McMurray, a Madison resident and child care provider. \"The problem was that I could not afford to see a doctor using my previous health care plan because my deductible was so high. Basically, I was betting I might need catastrophic health care someday more than I needed to see a doctor when I was sick. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, I now have a health care plan that is truly affordable. With my current plan, not only do I get to see a doctor when I need to, but my prescriptions are affordable too. I also get a reimbursement from my health care provider as a benefit for participating in a ‘Wellness program\\'.\"\"The Affordable Care Act is not just improving my access to health care, it has made my life much more humane,\" continued Oma Vic McMurray. \"Feeling well does bring a greater sense of joy in my life, which is important in the work I do with children. I am so grateful for the Affordable Care Act for what it has given to me, my family and my whole community.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'MADISON— Last week, Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) sent a letter, with Reps. Gwen Moore (WI-04) and Ron Kind (WI-03), urging Governor Walker to apply for a Preschool Development Expansion Grant. Unfortunately, Governor Scott Walker failed to submit an application before Wednesday\\'s deadline depriving Wisconsin of up to $60 million for preschool programs. Since taking office in 2010, Governor Walker has turned down or ignored federal grant opportunities to expand Medicaid for 87,000 Wisconsinites, to expand high speed internet service for schools, to build a high speed rail system between Madison and Milwaukee, and refused to increase the amount of heating assistance given to people in poverty resulting in cuts to Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. \"I\\'m very disappointed Scott Walker has put Tea Party politics ahead of doing his job as Governor,\" Rep. Pocan said. \"Playing political games with these federal grant opportunities, while neglecting our infrastructure, ignoring our most vulnerable citizens and running up a projected $1.9 billion deficit is inexcusable. Too many people from Wisconsin are being left behind as Walker prioritizes his higher ambitions.\"Gov. Walker has failed to take advantage of the following federal grant opportunities: Preschool Development Expansion GrantWisconsin was one of 36 states invited to apply for a share of $250 million in grants directed to help states develop and expand high-quality preschool programs for children from low- and moderate-income levels. Governor Walker missed the deadline of October 15 to apply for this grant. The Preschool Development Expansion Grant will award selected states with up to 15 million dollars a year for a period of 4 years.Medicaid ExpansionIn February of 2013, Walker turned down federal money to expand Medicaid in the state of Wisconsin. The expansion would apply to those who earn up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or $15,282.Broadband ExpansionWalker returned $23 million to the federal government in 2011. This money could have been used to expand high-speed internet service in schools, libraries, and government agencies.High-speed Rail ProjectIn 2010, governor-elect Walker turned away $810 million in federal stimulus money aimed at creating a high-speed train system between Milwaukee and Madison. It\\'s estimated that ending the project cost the state as many as 13,719 jobs.Food-stamp IncreaseRecently, Wisconsin ended a program that allowed residents access to increased food assistance paid for by the federal government through \"heat-and-eat\" programs. As a result of the states\\' decision not to increase the amount of heating assistance given to people in poverty, Wisconsin will see cuts in federal Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program (SNAP, or food stamps) benefits.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. — U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, today at a meeting with faculty and staff at the University of Wisconsin – Madison introduced the Next Generation Research Act which would improve opportunities for early career researchers. Unfortunately, current policies, including the budget sequester, are putting the brakes on research and innovation at a time when we need to step on the accelerator. Over the past ten years, the purchasing power of the NIH has decreased 22 percent while our global competitors have ramped up their own research capabilities. Last year, sequestration cut an additional $1.5 billion from the NIH budget.The bill, introduced in the Senate by Senator Tammy Baldwin, creates the Next Generation of Research Initiative within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of the Director and also directs a comprehensive study on the best possible ways our country can invest in the next generation of research.\"In order to foster long-term economic growth, we need to make a strong commitment to supporting research, innovation, science, and technology,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"This bill will ensure the next generation of researchers has the support they need to tackle the challenges of tomorrow. As our economy continues to recover, we must look down the road and invest in our young researchers, whose pioneering research will lead to improved health and quality of life for Americans and spurs innovation, U.S. economic growth, and job creation.\"Over the past 10 years, individual NIH research awards have dropped to record lows, less than 20 percent of grants submitted are funded. Even fewer grants are going to early career researchers, the young innovative researchers. Without these critical investments young Americans are not pursuing degrees in STEM fields, instead choosing a different career path or leaving the country for better research opportunities. Biomedical and scientific research is a major generator of economic activity, and NIH is its largest funding source.\"Federally funded research helps lead to lifesaving medical innovations and technological breakthroughs which can lead to a revolutionary new industry,\" continued Rep. Pocan. \"Congress has shirked its responsibility in recent years to be the driver of federally funded research. This bill helps early-career researchers and graduate students gain access to NIH grants to expand their research opportunities.\"What This Legislation Does:The bill creates the Next Generation of Research Initiative within the NIH Office of the Director.The office will promote and expand current policies and grant opportunities for young scientists.The office will also create new policies aimed at increasing access to NIH grants for new researchers, expand workforce diversity efforts and improving mentorship between veteran and new researchers (only 1 in 6 first time researchers succeed in receiving a second NIH grant).The bill also directs a comprehensive study on the best possible ways our country can establish the next generation of research.Why We Need This Legislation:In order to foster long-term economic growth, we need to make a strong commitment to supporting research, innovation, science, and technology. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) alone added more than $62 billion in new economic activity and the creation of 432,094 jobs across the country in 2011.Over the past ten years, the purchasing power of the NIH has decreased 22 percent while our global competitors have ramped up their own research capabilities. Last year, Sequestration cut an additional $1.5 billion from the NIH budget.These destructive policies are particularly devastating for our nation\\'s young researchers. NIH Director, Dr. Francis Collins, cautioned that \"we are putting an entire generation of scientists at risk.\" Currently, the average age of a first-time NIH grant recipient is 42 years old—up from 36 in 1980. Without action, talented young scientists may decide to chase another career, or leave the country to pursue their research.Current Groups Supporting the Bill:The Association of American Medical Colleges, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACSCAN), University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Wisconsin Health Science Library Association, the Association of Academic Health Sciences Libraries, the Medical Library Association, and the Midwest Chapter of the Medical Library Association.###',\n",

       "  'date': 'November 19, 2013',\n",
       "  'text': \"Washington, DC— Today, Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02) along with Congressman Ron Kind (WI-03) and Congresswoman Gwen Moore (WI-04) sent a letter to Governor Scott Walker expressing frustration with his most recent BadgerCare decision and urging him not to delay insurance coverage for approximately 80,000 Wisconsinites.Under Governor Walker's previous plan, about 80,000 low-income Wisconsinites would be transferred into the Affordable Care Act exchange from the BadgerCare program. At that same time, Governor Walker would accept about 80,000 new BadgerCare recipients. Last week, he announced his intent to delay the transfer. However, to offset that cost he would also delay covering those newly eligible Medicaid recipients.  “The most viable option for Governor Walker has been an option available to him all along—expand health care access in Wisconsin at no cost to the state. We simply would not be in this situation if Governor Walker had not rejected the $4 billion in federal funds to expand BadgerCare and provide families with secure, affordable and accessible health care. The health security of Wisconsin residents is too important to be used in a game of political football,” said Rep. Pocan.  “I am extremely disappointed that Governor Walker is once again turning his back on our most vulnerable populations,” said Rep. Moore. “As he touts his latest health care agenda item encouraging the legislature to keep current BadgerCare recipients on the program through March, the health of thousands could be in jeopardy. He is no hero. At a minimum, I urge our governor to keep his word and cover those newly eligible for BadgerCare beginning January 1. I continue to encourage him to stop his partisan games and accept federal funds to expand Medicaid.”  “Governor Walker never should have rejected federal support for Medicaid expansion in the first place. There are federal funds available right now for low-income Wisconsinites who need health care coverage, and all that’s standing in the way is the Governor,” said Rep. Kind. “He needs to put partisanship aside, and follow the example of many Republican governors around the country who have expanded Medicaid coverage for low-income individuals.”The letter reads as follows:The Honorable Scott WalkerGovernor of Wisconsin115 East CapitolMadison, WI 53702Dear Governor Walker,We are writing to express our concern about the impending health insurance coverage gap that could result for the 80,000 individuals under 100% of the poverty level, as a consequence of your recent proposal to the state legislature.Last Thursday, November 14th, we felt relief when you announced that you would allow a three-month extension of BadgerCare coverage to the approximately 77,000 low-income Wisconsinites whose coverage is due to expire on January 1, 2014. Given the challenging rollout of the Marketplaces thus far, we agree with your assessment that these individuals—who are scheduled to be transferred to the Affordable Care Act Health Insurance Marketplaces—would benefit from a longer enrollment period. We also support your proposal to extend the state’s high-risk insurance plan, known as the Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan (HIRSP), for three additional months.  However, we are gravely concerned about the fate of the 80,000 individuals under 100% of the poverty line, who were promised access to BadgerCare as of January 1, 2014 in your budget request. As you know, your budget would have granted BadgerCare eligibility to all those under the poverty level, including childless adults. Your Department of Health Services has been engaging in an outreach plan to the newly-eligible population, and some individuals who have applied for BadgerCare (through the Marketplaces or elsewhere) have already received confirmations of BadgerCare coverage. We were dismayed to learn that you now plan to renege on the promise to cover those below the poverty line in January 2014, and have now proposed delaying their eligibility until April 1, 2014.   The key source of our concern is that individuals below 100% of the poverty level are ineligible for premium tax credits to purchase coverage in the Marketplace. As a result of your budget proposal, the newly-eligible BadgerCare population will fall into a three-month gap in coverage; they will be unable to sign up for the BadgerCare program but also unable to purchase subsidized coverage in the Marketplace. Due to their low income level, they would not have the means to purchase coverage without a subsidy. This group would thus be in a unique and inequitable situation—essentially, worse off and with fewer options than other Wisconsinites. Given that this is a vulnerable population—they are already living in poverty and are more likely to be in poor health than the rest of the overall population—we strongly urge you to reconsider your plan for this group.We realize that you plan to utilize the “savings” from delaying coverage for the 80,000 individuals under the poverty line to pay for coverage for about 77,000 parents currently on BadgerCare. However, we encourage you to seek alternative budgetary savings, which would allow you to provide coverage for both populations through March 2014. In addition, we once again recommend that you reconsider your choice not to fully expand BadgerCare under the Affordable Care Act. You have the option to expand BadgerCare with a 100 percent match for all newly-eligible enrollees. This funding would allow you to offset the cost of continuing coverage for BadgerCare enrollees above the poverty line.It is time to move past politics and do what’s right for Wisconsin.  The Affordable Care Act provides the opportunity for Wisconsin to receive $119 million to ensure that our most at risk populations have health care access and coverage.  We urge you to join your Republican Governor colleagues and expand Medicaid.  Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, among others, recognized the need to move beyond political rhetoric and put their constituents’ health first.We remain dedicated to collaborating with you, and the Obama Administration, to ensure the best possible outcome for Wisconsin under the Affordable Care Act. We request that you consider our suggestions for the most vulnerable population in our state. We look forward to your response.Sincerely,Gwen Moore                                       Member of Congress  Ron Kind                                              Member of Congress  Mark PocanMember of Congress                                      Cc: The Honorable Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\",\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—Looking for multiple options and low health care costs? According to a new report released today from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), that’s exactly what Wisconsinites will get in the Health Insurance Marketplace that was established by the Affordable Care Act. According to the report, Wisconsin consumers will be able to choose from an average of 97 health plans in the Marketplace.  A 27-year old in Wisconsin making $25,000 a year will pay as low as $96 per month for health care after tax credits, while a family of four with an income of $50,000 per year could pay as low as $106 per month with tax credits.Starting on October 1, Wisconsinites have six months to enroll for health care through the Marketplace. Consumers can find out whether they qualify for premium assistance and compare plans side-by-side based on pricing, quality and benefits.  You cannot be denied health coverage because of a pre-existing condition.“The Affordable Care Act is doing exactly what it is supposed to do—provide the people of Wisconsin with health and economic security through increased choice and low prices,” said Pocan. “Through the new law, thousands of Wisconsinites who had lacked access to affordable, quality health insurance now will be able to cover themselves and their families, even if they have a pre-existing condition. Unfortunately, Governor Walker and tea party Republicans in Washington would instead prefer to see this law fail to score political points.  But no matter the stunts or obstructionist tactics they unleash, the Affordable Care Act is here to say, and that is a good thing for families all across Wisconsin.”Nationally, premiums will be about 16 percent lower than originally expected. A majority of enrollees will have a choice between at least two different health insurance companies.Plans in the Marketplace will be categorized as either “gold,” “silver,” or “bronze.”  Young adults will also have the option of purchasing a “catastrophic” plan, increasing their number of choices.   In Wisconsin, the average premium for the lowest-cost silver plan will be $344 and for the lowest cost bronze plan will be $287. Both of those numbers are before tax credits.

U.S. Rep.

Mark Pocan (WI-02) has added one more item to his list of actions the House could take up instead of these partisan and futile efforts: Fully fund SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), which provides a vital lifeline to 800,000 Wisconsinites and more than 20 million hungry children nationwide. Last week, House Republicans pushed through a partisan and incomplete Farm Bill that went against precedent and separated nutrition assistance funding from the agricultural provisions of the bill, putting the food stamp program at risk.“It’s been just two months, but we are once again wasting time on the obstructionist partisan objectives of the House Republican leadership that could be spent on creating jobs, tackling the college affordability crisis, passing a budget, or providing vital food assistance to 800,000 Wisconsinites. Unless leadership can get its priorities in order, this Congress will continue to be seen as the most ineffectual in history. I’ve said it before and I will say it again—the people of Wisconsin deserve better.”Hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites in the Second District are already benefitting from the ACA.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON –U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today condemned the extreme and very likely unconstitutional bill being considered by the U.S. House of Representatives that would place a national ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and roll back critical women’s rights. A vote on the bill is scheduled for later this evening.The bill, pushed by Republican Rep. Trent Franks (AZ-08), effectively bans abortions after 20 weeks with minimal exceptions and marks another GOP attempt to limit women’s rights across the country. Last week, Republicans in the Wisconsin State Senate passed a bill that mandates medically unnecessary ultrasounds before an abortion can be performed. Both bills amount to deep infringements on women’s hard-fought rights and represent a severe government intrusion into a woman’s personal health decisions.“This is extremism at its worst. From Washington to Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers seem to think it is their job to get in between a woman and her doctor,” Pocan said. “These dual, dangerous efforts are out of sync with what Americans believe. Yet Republicans seem to think it’s a better use of time and taxpayer dollars  to roll back women’s rights than focus on economic growth, ending the sequester, completing a budget, and preventing student loan interest rates from doubling.  Women’s rights are not a political toy for Republicans to throw out whenever they want to score cheap points—they are fundamental rights that deserve absolute protection. I will vote firmly against this abortion ban and I will continue to fight to protect women’s rights in Wisconsin and across the country.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'MADISON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today issued the following statement on the third anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010.“The passage of the Affordable Care Act marks a defining moment in our country where we decided that access to quality, affordable health care for all Americans should be a right, not a privilege. Since the act’s passage, nearly 1.5 million Wisconsinites have received free preventive services, 43,000 young people in the state have been able to stay on their parents’ health care plan, and Wisconsin community health centers have received more than $43 million to expand and improve their services. Because of the law, families in Wisconsin will no longer have to worry that a pre-existing condition will prevent them from receiving health insurance, and women in Wisconsin don’t have to worry about higher premiums merely due to their gender.“With all the progress we’ve made, I find the actions of some politicians in Wisconsin to be highly worrisome. By rejecting federal funding to expand Medicaid in Wisconsin, Governor Walker is removing guaranteed health and economic security for thousands of low-income children, parents and seniors.“Forcing thousands of Wisconsinites out of BadgerCare while denying the state close to $1.3 billion of economic activity and 10,500 news jobs doesn’t make sense. Three years removed from the Affordable Care Act’s passage, we need to move beyond the mindless and petty partisan politics, and find ways we can continue to strengthen our health care system for all Wisconsinites.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) yesterday attended the Presidential signing of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) at the Department of the Interior. Last week, House Democrats rejected a discriminatory version of the bill that removed protections for LGBT, Native American and immigrant victims of domestic violence, and then won passage of an inclusive and bipartisan VAWA that expands and improves this historic law. Pocan had joined his colleagues on the LGBT Congressional Equality Caucus in urging their colleagues to reject the discriminatory version of the bill and requiring protections for all victims to be restored.“I am honored to be a part of history today and join President Obama as he signs an inclusive and expanded Violence Against Women Act. This legislation reconfirms our commitment as a country to do all that we can to prevent domestic violence and sexual assault.  Equally as important, it ensures we provide support, protections and a voice to victims—all victims—of these heinous crimes.“In particular, I would like to thank my fellow Wisconsinite, colleague and friend Congresswoman Gwen Moore for leading the fight in the House to ensure the Violence Against Women Act was passed without compromising our priorities and principles. Rep. Moore inspired myself, my colleagues, advocates, victims and women across the nation with her passion and commitment to seeing this through, even after the bill went more than 500 days without reauthorization.  Because of the efforts of Rep. Moore and the advocacy of countless others, today our country is a stronger and safer place.”###',\n",

       "  'date': 'October 10, 2024',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C.\\xa0– Today, United States Representatives Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), Rick Larsen (D-Wash.), Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), and Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), along with Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.), reintroduced the Stop Wall Street Looting Act, comprehensive legislation to fundamentally reform the private equity industry and level the playing field by forcing private investment firms to take responsibility for the outcomes of companies they take over, empowering workers and protecting investors. This reintroduction comes after private equity firm Cerberus looted Steward Health Care, leaving hospitals, patients, and workers hanging out to dry.“It’s long past time for billionaires and big corporations to stop gambling with hardworking Americans’ and their communities’ assets in service of corporate greed,”\\xa0said\\xa0Representative Pocan.\\xa0“In Wisconsin, we\\'ve seen what happens when private equity firms like Sun Capital raid companies for their wealth and leave workers and communities to pick up the pieces. When Sun Capital took over Shopko – a Wisconsin-based retail chain that had stood strong for more than 50 years – they drained it dry, buried it in debt, pushed it into bankruptcy, and abandoned roughly 14,000 workers. This bill will finally hold these predatory firms accountable and protect workers from being plundered by corporate greed.\"“From health care to housing, millions of Americans are seeing private equity take over companies with the promise of improving services, only to strip them for parts and hurt both workers and working families,”\\xa0said Congresswoman Jayapal.\\xa0“It’s time for Congress to take action to protect Americans from the dangers of private equity and corporate greed, and that’s exactly what our\\xa0Stop Wall Street Looting Act will do. This legislation will implement guardrails, close loopholes, and increase accountability to prevent devastating job losses and protect our communities.”“Private equity takeovers are legal looting that make a handful of Wall Street executives very rich while costing thousands of people their jobs, putting valuable companies out of \\xadbusiness, and in the case of health care, is literally a matter of life and death,”\\xa0said Senator Warren.\\xa0“Our bill is designed to close loopholes and end incentives for private equity pillaging – and it will make sure what happened at Steward never happens again.”“When out-of-state investors buy Wisconsin companies only to turn a quick profit and shutter their doors, it’s Wisconsin workers and communities that suffer. I’m committed to ensuring that when Wisconsin businesses are purchased, Wisconsin families are protected and not left high and dry like we’ve seen in places like Janesville, Green Bay, and Waukesha,”\\xa0said Senator Baldwin.\\xa0“Our legislation will help put workers and our community first – protecting them from predatory practices that too often result in devastating job losses for Wisconsin’s working families.”“More and more Americans are feeling the presence of private equity in our economy, including in critical sectors like housing and health care,”\\xa0said Senator Smith.\\xa0“They arrive promising to revitalize communities and turn around struggling hospitals and companies, but far too often, they extract value for themselves at the expense of workers and ordinary people. This bill will help put an end to their most egregious practices and provide accountability.”“The greed of private equity robs too many Americans of stability, security, and prosperity. In Massachusetts, the Steward Health Care crisis is just one example of private equity sacrificing the long-term prosperity of workers, customers, and communities for their short-term profits. The Stop Wall Street Looting Act would finally prevent private equity firms from monetizing productive sectors of the economy and hollowing them out by laying off workers and closing businesses. We need to put in guardrails for private equity to ensure they cannot sacrifice people for profits,”\\xa0said Senator Markey.Since 2020, private equity fund assets have grown exponentially, reaching nearly $8 trillion in 2023 compared to $4.5 trillion in 2020. Private equity funds have purchased companies in nearly every sector of the economy — from nursing homes, to newspapers, to grocery stores — laying off hundreds of thousands of workers and ruining thousands of companies in the process.The private equity industry claims to invest in companies while also earning high returns for investors by using their management expertise to make the companies’ operations more efficient, and then selling the companies at a profit. In reality, private equity funds often load mountains of debt on the companies they buy, strip them of their assets, and extract exorbitant fees and dividends, guaranteeing payouts for themselves regardless of how the investment performs. When their debt-ridden investments go belly-up, private equity funds walk away with no responsibility for the mess they create, leaving workers in the lurch and forcing communities to clean up their mess.It’s time to level the playing field, protect workers, consumers, and investors, and force private equity firms to take responsibility for the companies they control. This bill does so by closing the loopholes that allow private equity to capture all the rewards of their investments while insulating themselves from risk and liability. The Stop Wall Street Looting Act will:Require Private Investment Funds to Have Skin in the Game:\\xa0Private equity firms, the firm’s general partners, and their insiders will all be on the hook for the liabilities of companies under their control—including debt, legal judgments, and pension-related obligations—to better align the incentives of private equity firms and the companies they own. Liability would not extend to the fund’s limited partners, ensuring that only those that control portfolio firms are on the hook. In order to encourage more responsible use of debt, the bill ends the tax subsidy for excessive leverage and closes the carried interest loophole.End Looting of Portfolio Companies.\\xa0To give portfolio companies a shot at success, the bill limits how much money private equity firms can extract from companies and closes the loophole that private equity firms have used to hide certain assets from bankruptcy courts. Every transaction since Steward Health Care was bought by private equity would be subject to review as part of Steward’s bankruptcy to determine whether it can be clawed back as a fraudulent transfer.Protect Workers, Customers and Communities.\\xa0This proposal prevents private equity firms from walking away when a company fails and protects workers and communities by:Prioritizing workers’ pay in the bankruptcy process and amending the laws to increase the priority claims for unpaid earnings and other benefits from $10,000 to $20,000 per worker.Creating incentives for job retention so that workers can benefit from a company’s second chance.Ending the immunity of private equity firms from legal liability when their portfolio companies break the law, including the WARN Act. When workers at a plant are shortchanged or residents at a nursing home are hurt because private equity firms force portfolio companies to cut corners, the firm should be liable.Expanding protections for striking workers by clarifying unfair labor practices and the employer duty to bargain.Empower Investors by Increasing Transparency.\\xa0Private equity managers will be required to disclose fees, returns, and other information about their funds and the corporate loans they make so that investors can monitor their investments. This would have required Cerberus to disclose the terms of its investments in Steward Health Care, which Cerberus continues to withhold from Congress.Put Guardrails Around Accessing Public Funds.\\xa0Firms receiving any funds from a federal or state agency must publicly disclose how the funds are used and will be prohibited from acquiring any company or making a distribution to investors for two years after receipt.Drive REITS out of Health Care.\\xa0Prohibits payments from federal health programs to entities that sell assets or use assets for a loan collateral made to a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) d; repeals a rule in the Tax Code that allows taxable REIT subsidiaries to exert influence on the operations of health care entities; and removes the 20 percent pass-through deduction, passed in the 2017 Trump tax cuts, for all REIT investors. Ralph de la Torre executed a sale-leaseback transaction of the Steward properties in exchange for a $1.25B payout from a REIT; this would have banned the hospitals from continuing to receive federal dollars upon executing the property sale—thus likely preventing the sale.The bill is supported by Action Center on Race and the Economy, AFL-CIO, American Economic Liberties Project, American Federation of Teachers, Americans for Financial Reform, Center for Popular Democracy, Coalition for Patient-Centered Care, Communications Workers of America, Community Catalyst, Economic Policy Institute, Indivisible, Massachusetts Nurses Association, National Employment Law Project, National Nurses United, National Women’s Law Center, Private Equity Stakeholder Project, People’s Action, Public Citizen, SEIU, Strong for All, Student Borrower Protection Center, Take Medicine Back, Take on Wall Street, UNITE HERE, United for Respect, Working Families Party, and Worth Rises.“Private equity has an immense impact on the U.S. economy, touching virtually every aspect of life from healthcare to housing to technology to retail and more. Private equity’s extractive playbook harms workers and communities, diminishes access to quality affordable health care, worsens the housing crisis and the climate crisis, and perpetuates systemic racism. Without major changes, a handful of ultra wealthy Wall Street executives will continue getting richer at everyone else’s expense. The Stop Wall Street Looting Act takes important, much needed steps to reign in Wall Street predatory practices and promote a just and sustainable economy,”said Lisa Donner, Executive Director, Americans for Financial Reform.“Union busting, pollution, and bankruptcy aren’t side effects of the private equity model: they are the model,”\\xa0said Porter McConnell, Take on Wall Street.\\xa0“It’s a smash-and-grab, plain and simple. That’s why we are so pleased to see comprehensive legislation like the Stop Wall Street Looting Act introduced in Congress today. We created the loopholes in the law that allowed the private equity industry to thrive, and we can end them. Our communities, our economy, and our democracy are depending on it.\"\\xa0“As we fight for more public investment in the child care sector, we must also rein in private equity’s ability to enrich themselves at the expense of the public. Building guardrails – such as those in the Stop Wall Street Looting Act – will help put the wellbeing of children and families ahead of private equity’s profits,”\\xa0said Melissa Boteach, Vice President, Income Security and Child Care/Early Learning, National Women’s Law Center.“Private equity firms, which control nearly $15 trillion in assets, routinely prioritize quick, outsized profits, at the expense of workers, patients, renters, and local economies as part of their business model,”\\xa0said Chris Noble, Policy Director for the Private Equity Stakeholder Project.\\xa0“The Stop Wall Street Looting Act provides an essential check on this opaque industry. By addressing the systemic risks tied to debt-laden private equity buyouts, this legislation prioritizes the long-term health of businesses and communities over short-term profits for wealthy private equity executives.”\\xa0“Private equity should have no influence over medical treatment decisions made jointly by independent physicians and their patients. The Stop Wall Street Looting Act goes a long way towards ensuring physicians, in consultation with their patients, are able to deliver quality, patient-centered, cost-efficient care without corporate interference,”\\xa0said Dr. Stephen M. McCollam, Chair, Coalition for Patient-Centered Care.“Wall Street private equity firms have proven themselves to be a parasite on workers, our economy, and American retailers by gutting companies for profit and driving mass layoffs. Holding billionaire profiteers accountable for the damage they do to our working families and communities is imperative to addressing growing economic inequality,”\\xa0said United for Respect Co-Executive Directors Bianca Agustin and Terrysa Guerra\\xa0in a joint statement. “The Stop Wall Street Looting Act will help close loopholes in our laws that for too long have allowed private equity to pillage companies and amass huge profits while workers lose their jobs and are left with nothing. United For Respect is proud to support this bill — and we need all legislators to join us in protecting workers and putting Wall Street on the hook for the havoc they reap.”Text of Bill (PDF)\\xa0|\\xa0Text of One-Pager (PDF)\\xa0|\\xa0Text of Section-by-Section (PDF)\\xa0|\\xa0Text of Economic Analysis (PDF)',\n",

These measures include expanding access to child care, keeping workers safe, and giving our troops a raise. Any inaction toward this bill could have shut down the government, allowing the GOP leadership to give us a bill that would have been worse, riddled with extreme priorities. House Democrats played the best hand with the cards we were dealt.\\xa0“I’m not supportive of some provisions in this bill, including a delay of additional funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). This is a continuation of the Administration’s current policy toward the agency which must be overturned. I support immediately providing much-needed funding toward the agency and will continue my work to do just that.”\\xa0By passing the bill, Democrats rejected many extreme Republican cuts and policy riders. Instead, this government funding package provides:$1 billion increase for child care and Head Start.$20 million increase for Title I education funding, rejecting Republican efforts to eliminate 224,000 teachers’ jobs.$14 million increase in funding for special education.Protects funding for the maximum Pell Grant at $7,395 per student.\\xa0$1.1 billion for Senior Nutrition Programs, which includes Meals on Wheels.Increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health, including for cancer and Alzheimer’s research.Provides 5.2% pay increase for servicemembers and increases the Basic Allowance for Housing by 5.4%.\\xa0$1 billion increase for climate change and resilience activities.Adds 12,000 more Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who assisted the United States.Includes $29.9 billion to support the reunification of migrant families cruelly separated at the southern border by the Trump administration.Removes numerous Republican policy riders including 10 that would have limited women’s access to reproductive health, 44 that attacked the rights of the LGBTQI+ community, and banned funding for President Biden’s executive orders to address the climate crisis.As a member of the Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for drafting all federal funding legislation, Rep.

       "  'date': 'July 25, 2023',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. —\\xa0Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, introduced the\\xa0Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act, legislation to improve training for food service employees in schools. The legislation would assist in the implementation of existing professional standards for these workers by ensuring that training occurs during work hours and at no cost, and if training is unable to occur during scheduled work hours, the bill makes clear that employees must be informed in advance and compensated appropriately. Representatives Mark Pocan (D, WI-02) and Elise Stefanik (R, NY-21) are introducing companion, bipartisan legislation in the House today. Senator Murray first introduced the legislation last Congress.“Food service workers do really essential work in our schools every day to make sure\\xa0kids can learn during the school day,”\\xa0said Senator Murray.\\xa0“Our legislation would make sure these workers get the best training available and that they aren’t being shortchanged for their time—common-sense fixes that will help our schools recruit and maintain a professional and skilled foodservice workforce.”“Nutritious meals are as important to a child’s development as learning to read,”\\xa0said Rep. Mark Pocan,\\xa0“and school food service workers play a vital role in guaranteeing every child gets the healthy food they deserve. The\\xa0Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act\\xa0will make it easier for workers to complete needed training and ensure food service workers have the skills to safely serve our kids. I’m proud to sponsor this critical bill with colleagues from across the aisle and in the Senate because good food and good jobs should be a part of 21st-century schools.”“When our students are hungry, they can’t learn. The dedicated food service professionals who prepare and serve school meals are committed to providing all students with the healthy meals that set the stage for learning and participation, and they need appropriate training for the expertise required,”\\xa0said Becky Pringle, President of the National Education Association.\\xa0“The\\xa0Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act\\xa0will help ensure that our food service professionals have access to training sessions during their paid work days or are compensated if the training has to occur outside of work hours to ensure our students are getting the healthy, nutritious meals they need to thrive.”The reauthorization of the\\xa0Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010\\xa0enacted professional standards for food service workers. These standards worked to ensure that school meals are as healthy as possible for students. The\\xa0Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act\\xa0builds on these standards and would:Ensure that training sessions occur primarily during regular, paid working hours;Compensate workers for training sessions that must occur outside of work hours;Make every effort to inform workers of training sessions that must take place outside of work hours;Ensure that school food service workers are not penalized if they are unable to attend training sessions outside of work hours; andPromote in-person, hands-on training whenever possible and appropriate.The text of the\\xa0Improving Training for School Food Service Workers Act\\xa0is available\\xa0HERE.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02)\\xa0and\\xa0Greg Casar (TX-35)\\xa0introduced the Food Worker Pay Standards Act, which would ensure that the federal government only purchases food produced by workers who earn fair pay and benefits.The bill would direct the Secretary of Labor to use local wages and benefits for food production workers in conjunction with local collective bargaining agreements to establish a regional prevailing wage and would prevent the federal government from purchasing food produced by workers paid less than those prevailing rates. This standard would apply to meat, meat food product, poultry, poultry food product, and processed food workers.“The federal government should not be in the business of rewarding companies with taxpayer-funded contracts if they aren’t adequately paying or protecting their workers,”\\xa0said Rep. Mark Pocan.\\xa0“Food processing is one of our country’s most dangerous industries and one that relies heavily on workers from marginalized communities. The time is long overdue to protect these vulnerable workers with federal guardrails. This bill tells food processing companies that the government is only willing to work with businesses that put workers first. Anything less will not be funded by the American people.”“Every single worker – no matter the industry or occupation – is entitled to just wages and safe working conditions,”\\xa0said Rep. Greg Casar.\\xa0\"We can make sure that we’re doing business with companies that are paying fair wages. That way, the federal government is helping create an economy that works for all of us, not just a privileged few. It’s time for Congress to pass the Food Worker Pay Standards Act and support workers employed in one of our country’s most dangerous industries.”Food production and processing workers face dangerous conditions and federal contracting should not undermine the high standards that workers have secured through bargaining with their employers. Animal slaughtering and processing workers suffer injury and illness at more than\\xa0twice the rate\\xa0of other workers. Federal contracts should improve – not undermine – wages and benefits for workers.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02),\\xa0a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee,\\xa0released the following statement after he voted against the Bipartisan Budget Bill:“For months, I have been calling on Speaker McCarthy to put a clean debt ceiling bill on the floor to avoid bringing our nation to the brink of an unnecessary economic catastrophe, just as we did three times under President Trump and 78 times since 1960. Instead, he and his Republican colleagues chose to engage in hostage-taking, refusing to raise the debt ceiling to avoid default unless paired with devastating cuts to essential government programs. While I am relieved the President and Democratic Leadership were able to walk back the worst of the Republicans’ demands, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I was unable to support this final agreement due to remaining unanswered questions.“This bill critically undercuts the appropriations process, one of the last processes in Washington where Democrats and Republicans work together. Severely restraining domestic spending while continuing to inflate unchecked defense spending for the Pentagon shows Republicans are not actually serious about addressing the deficit.\\xa0“With too many unanswered questions and unknown, undisclosed side deals, including a shortfall of $58 billion in promised domestic funding not explicitly guaranteed in the language of the bill for things like education, healthcare, and more, I could not, in good conscience, vote for this bill.\\xa0“In addition to my serious concerns about the impacts to the appropriations process and backroom deals, this bill expands SNAP work requirements for older Americans and threatens cash assistance for the lowest-income families, while simultaneously rescinding critical IRS investments intended to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. Moreover, this bill weakens key environmental and climate protections.\\xa0“While I am relieved that we will avoid an economic default, I remain steadfast that we never should have had to engage with an extreme MAGA Republican dominated caucus in hostage negotiations over Americans’ livelihoods to begin with. Looking forward, we should eliminate the unnecessary debt ceiling to avoid any question of the full faith and credit of the United States.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement expressing his concerns about OpenGate Capital\\'s plans to outsource 150+ jobs at the Hufcormanufacturing plant in Janesville, WI to Mexico. He also reaffirmed the need for his bill, the Stop Wall Street Looting Act, which will be reintroduced in the coming months. This legislation would fundamentally reform the private equity industry by forcing private equity firms to take responsibility for the outcomes of companies they take over, empowering workers, and protecting investors.\"The fallout from OpenGate Capital\\'s decision to extract over one-hundred and fifty good union jobs from Janesville could have devastating consequences on Hufcor workers and their families, and I am calling on OpenGate to abandon their plan immediately. This isn\\'t the first time we\\'ve seen private equity firms swoop into a community, squeeze a business for cash, and leave workers with absolutely nothing. It\\'s time that we finally hold these predatory private equity firms accountable for the damage they\\'ve done in communities across the country. I look forward to reintroducing my bicameral legislation with Senator Warren, the Stop Wall Street Looting Act, which would ensure private equity takes responsibility for the outcomes of businesses they take over and would end their practice of looting portfolio companies. This legislation would also put a stop to extractive practices that incentivize buying companies to sell them for parts, and most importantly, protect workers like those at Hufcor, many of whom I represent in Congress, from the consequences of firms\\' greed.\"###',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.— Today, U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) announced House passage of $18 million in earmarked transportation projects for Wisconsin\\'s 2nd Congressional District. These projects were included in the \"Investing in a New Vision for the Environment and Surface Transportation in America (INVEST in America) Act,\" which seeks to revitalize America\\'s infrastructure. \"I am proud to have secured $18 million in critical funding to rebuild South Central Wisconsin\\'s transportation infrastructure,\" Congressman Pocan said. \"For too long, we have failed to act boldly when it comes to investing in our infrastructure, and this has left us with unsafe bridges, congested roads, failing sewer systems, and many other critical structural issues. The INVEST in America Act would also help create millions of good-paying jobs and support U.S. manufacturing, while setting our country on a path toward zero emissions in the transportation sector. This bill takes a step forward in getting us on the right track to create economic opportunity for all in the 21stcentury and beyond.\" Congressman Pocan\\'s surface transportation projects included in the INVEST in America Act are listed below. $6.275 million to reconstruct Atwood Ave. in Madison from Fair Oaks to Cottage Grove Rd.  This project will reconstruct the existing roadway with pedestrian and bicycle multi-use paths and reconstruct a portion of the popular Lake Loop Bike Path.$2 million to replace the functionally obsolete and structurally deficient bridge over Pheasant Branch in the City of Middleton on County Highway M/Century Ave.  A bike tunnel and trail improvements will be included in the project to connect the existing bike network.$2 million to resurface County Highway CV along the northern and western boundary of the Dane County Regional Airport and include on-road bike facilities and replace drainage structures.$2 million to resurface and widen County Highway CC in the Town and Village of Oregon which will enable on-road bike lanes.  Curbs, gutters, and ditches in areas within the Village of Oregon would also be improved.$2 million to resurface and widen County Highway P and improve on-road bike lanes.  Replacing and/or widening drainage structures would also occur, and curbs and gutters will replace ditches in areas within the unincorporated Village of Klevenville.  The Military Ridge Trail Cross would also be improved.$2 million to repair 6.56 miles of deteriorating pavement on US 14 between Spring Green and Madison.$1.6 million to convert the existing WIS 23/WIS 136 intersection in Reedsburg into a single lane roundabout in response to multiple fatal crashes that have occurred at the intersection over the last four years.  Wisconsin roundabouts have been demonstrated to reduce the number of crashes resulting in death or injury by more than half.$125,000 to resurface Highway 033 in Reedsburg from Preston Ave. to State Highway 023.See Congressman Pocan\\'s initial letter to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure requesting these projects here.

The Trump Administration was ideologically hostile to collective bargaining.  President Trump himself issued three executive orders in 2018 that undermined public sector unions and the statutory right of federal employees to be represented by unions.[1] Under then-Attorney General Barr, DOJ also took steps to effectuate President Trump\\'s opposition to collective bargaining by filing a petition with the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) to exclude immigration judges from eligibility for membership in the National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ).  The NAIJ has been the recognized representative of immigration judges for collective bargaining purposes since 1979.  For years NAIJ has advocated on behalf of immigration judges on many issues including performance evaluations and discipline, judicial security, COVID response, and efficient docket management.  NAIJ\\'s collective bargaining agreement has protected judges from unfair discipline.  Further, NAIJ has advanced the causes of due process, transparency, accountability, efficiency, and professionalism in the Immigration Court. DOJ\\'s petition was denied by the FLRA\\'s Office of General Counsel in July 2020.  Attorney General Barr then filed an application for review, pursuant to which the previous denial was reversed by the two-member Republican FLRA majority just days before the election in November 2020.  In his dissenting opinion, then-FLRA Member and current FLRA Chairman Ernest DuBester characterized the majority decision as \"the antithesis of reasoned decision making\" and stated that \"it is abundantly clear that the majority\\'s sole objective is to divest the [immigration judges] of their statutory rights.\" NAIJ filed a motion to reconsider this ruling which is currently pending.Elections have consequences.  One of President Biden\\'s first actions was to rescind the Trump anti-union executive orders. Now it is up to you to rescind former Attorney General Barr\\'s anti-union petition with the FLRA.  Should the FLRA\\'s decision be allowed to stand, the ramifications and the legal basis for the decision will have an immediate negative effect on NAIJ and all its bargaining unit members. But it will have an equally, if not far more, profound impact on federal employees\\' right to form and join a union.  Any professional employee will be vulnerable to being characterized as a manager because the FLRA decision is so broad and provides no rationale for the departure from its prior precedent. We believe federal agencies should move forward in alignment with President Biden\\'s values and directives in support of the right of employees to organize and join a union. Therefore, we urge you to rescind this anti-union petition before the FLRA. Sincerely, Rep. Mark PocanCo-Chair, Labor CaucusRep. Linda T. Sánchez Co-Chair, Labor CaucusRep. Thomas R.

Biden, Jr.President of the United States The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear President Biden:We write to congratulate you on progress your administration has made in combatting the Covid-19 virus. Your administration\\'s efforts have saved the lives of countless Americans and have put our country on the path towards recovery.  However, we urgently request that your administration immediately issue the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\\'s (OSHA) Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to protect frontline workers from Covid-19. While your administration has made significant strides to protect workers and the public from the Covid-19 virus, frontline workers remain at risk as they face continuing exposure to Covid-19 in the workplace.  As you know, many frontline workers are working to provide health care, groceries, meatpacking, transportation, and other essential services that keep our country running, often without enforceable health and safety standards specific to Covid-19. On January 21st, you issued an Executive Order directing the Department of Labor to \"consider whether any emergency temporary standards on Covid-19, including with respect to masks in the workplace, are necessary, and if such standards are determined to be necessary, issue them by March 15, 2021.\" The ETS was only formally sent to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on April 26th, beginning a two-week Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) review. More than two months have passed since your original deadline for an ETS to be issued, and OMB has had a month to review the proposed ETS.  The consequences of these delays are dire, and for some workers the delay has been fatal.  Our nation\\'s workers need an enforceable federal standard that will ensure that their employers provide the comprehensive protections they need, including ventilation, respiratory protection, testing and screening, exposure notification, and on-site vaccinations. Further, on May 13th, the CDC issued new Covid guidelines which state that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear masks, avoid crowds or large gatherings, or need to isolate after exposure or get tested unless they are symptomatic.  We are concerned that these new guidelines may put frontline workers across the country at further risk of illness and death while no OSHA ETS is in place.  We respectfully urge you to issue the OSHA ETS and ensure it covers all at-risk workers without further delay. Sincerely, Rep. Mark PocanCo-Chair, Labor CaucusRep. Linda T.

Toward that end, we write to offer our support for the following principles included in your American Jobs Plan proposal:Passing the PRO Act.Ensuring a prevailing wage in any funded project.Building, preserving, and retrofitting more than 2 million homes and buildings.Replacing 100% of lead pipes and service lines, supporting clean drinking water and wastewater system investments, and remediating PFAS contamination.Modernizing 20,000 miles of road and repairing 10,000 bridges.Committing $85 billion to public transit.Injecting $100 billion into the push for high-speed broadband for all Americans.Providing $100 billion for workforce development and worker protection programs.Creating 1 to 2 million new registered apprenticeship slots and growing preapprenticeship programs that are more inclusive and diverse.Modernizing America\\'s education infrastructure including electrification of school buses.Investing $400 billion to expand access to quality and affordable home and communitybased care for the elderly and differently abled persons.Establishing a Child Care Growth and Innovation Fund and investing $25 billion in upgraded childcare facilities and childcare jobs.Ensuring that as many goods and materials as possible are made in America and shipped on U.S.-flag, U.S. crewed vessels.Curbing offshoring of jobs and ensuring multinational organizations pay their fair share.Respectfully, we ask you to work with us to achieve the following priorities:Allowing the deduction of union dues.Cracking down on companies deducting union-busting efforts as business expenses.Requiring labor standards, at minimum prevailing wage, are a requirement for any and all government-supported construction activities, including those pursued through tax incentives, bonds, grants, loans, etc.Creating new and enhanced federal bridge corrosion remediation requirements.Ensuring states that receive education funds agree to \"maintenance of effort\" – providing a minimum amount of future education funding in exchange for federal funding.Funding increases for offshore wind energy production and job training.Incentivizing the resurgence of not only domestic supply chains, but clean manufacturing and clean technology within those chains through tax incentives.Increasing the public health workforce through a $400 billion investment over 10 years.Investing in a federal long-term climate adaptation program through FEMA & NOAA.Promoting EVs through historic federal investment, favorable tax treatment for domestically-produced vehicles, and building out a domestic supply chain; and requiring usage of the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program to ensure strong labor protections in the production and maintenance of EV charging stations.Extending protections contained in union contracts to future employers when ownership changes.Ensuring private activity bonds are subject to work requirements and protections.Creating good paying union jobs and increasing energy efficiency by incentivizing the installation of mechanical insulation in buildings.Providing much needed financial support to multi-employer pension plans.Enforcing government contractor wage and benefit standards including prevailing wage.Requiring infrastructure investments to \"Buy American\" to create jobs in the United States.Again, we thank you for your commitment to America\\'s infrastructure needs, for your commitment to targeting investments domestically, and for your commitment to workers and organized labor. We greatly look forward to working with you to build America back better.Sincerely, Rep. Mark PocanCo-Chair, Labor CaucusRep. Steven HorsfordCo-Chair, Labor CaucusRep.

Despite a coordinated campaign of intimidation, union-busting and interference by Amazon, workers stood up to describe their awful working conditions, organized to form a union with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) and did not back down against Amazon\\'s corruption.\"We support the RWDSU\\'s filing an objection to the conduct of the election and related Unfair Labor Practice charges (ULPs) with the National Labor Relations Board—a right that they clearly have under the National Labor Relations Act. Amazon\\'s workers deserve to be treated better than they have been on the warehouse floor and better than they have been during this election.\"This election has made one thing abundantly clear, workers across the country need the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. Right now, the deck is stacked against working people and if the PRO Act was law, Amazon would not have gotten away with much of their union-busting tactics. In fact, Amazon workers would like already have a union. It is imperative that the Senate pass this integral piece of labor legislation.\"We will continue to stand in solidarity with the workers nationwide organizing to form a union, and we won\\'t rest until Amazon treats its works fairly.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI —Today, Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (CT-03) announced they will introduce two bills to prevent working people from being laid off due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Preventing Layoffs During a Public Health Emergency Act and the Layoff Prevention Act would provide federal support for states\\' work sharing programs, which give employers the flexibility they need to maintain their workforce and keep American workers on the job. Struggling companies will be able to reduce hours instead of their workforce—helping them save on rehiring costs—while employees will keep their jobs and receive a portion of Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits to make up for lost wages.DeLauro championed these provisions during the financial crisis and secured inclusion of parts of the Layoff Prevention Act in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. By 2016, work sharing programs were established in 29 states, including Connecticut. However, the federal financing and grants lapsed in August 2015 despite DeLauro\\'s efforts to extend them.\"Businesses are closing and people are losing their jobs right now because of the coronavirus pandemic,\" said Congresswoman DeLauro. \"Working people and families are facing an unprecedented threat to their economic security, and many do not know how they are going to be able to put food on the table and pay their bills. Fortunately, Congress can help make a difference in people\\'s lives right now. By expanding federal support for work sharing programs, workers would be able to keep their jobs and companies can avert layoffs and costly rehiring. Moreover, with fewer workers unemployed, there is less of a burden on the Unemployment Insurance benefits system—which is currently being strained in many states. Work sharing programs were a bright spot in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and we should immediately reinstate federal support for them in the next coronavirus response package.\"\"Work sharing is one of the most impactful tools we can utilize to reduce widespread layoffs nationally during this pandemic,\" said Congressman Pocan. \"A public health emergency doesn\\'t mean we have to leave small businesses to face this crisis alone. More than half of all states already have work sharing programs that give small businesses and their workers the flexibility to reduce employee hours while allowing workers to collect partial unemployment insurance to compensate for lower hours. At a time when workers live in fear of losing their next paycheck, we must do everything in our power to protect their livelihoods.\"DeLauro serves as Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Labor, and Pocan serves as a Member of the Subcommittee.Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) has introduced companion legislation in the Senate.',\n",

Rush (IL), Darren Soto (FL), Susan Wild (PA).See the full letter below and here.Dear Speaker Pelosi,Thank you for your leadership during this global pandemic. As you develop a third legislative package in response to the coronavirus outbreak, we encourage you to include additional, immediate, and direct financial assistance to America\\'s millions of small businesses, independent contractors, sole proprietors, and gig economy workers.The initial House-passed coronavirus measures included strong first steps to begin to ensure many workers are provided the resources they need to survive lost wages during this time. Unfortunately, the tax credits offered to impacted employers are unlikely to address the revenue loss that will occur in the coming months. Small business enterprises will struggle to pay rent, service existing debt, cover utilities, continue to pay insurance, and meet the myriad other expenses they face.As Congress moves toward a third coronavirus legislative package, we encourage the inclusion of direct cash assistance to cover lost expenses during a time of forced closure or limited operations that is on a scale consistent with the cash assistance likely to be provided to workers soon. We are pleased that policy discussions for the initial coronavirus packages focused on workers, but we fear that if small business concerns aren\\'t addressed in the near-term workers may not have jobs to return to when this pandemic ends. We also believe that small business interests are just as deserving of assistance as large business interests, particularly when they are far more likely to have paid a larger relative share of their income in federal taxes.We thank you for your consideration of these views and look forward to continuing to work with you on behalf of America\\'s workers, independent contractors, sole proprietors, gig economy workers, and small business community.',\n",

This legislation will be a key step to bringing jobs back to the United States and employing workers across New York State.\"\"For too long, we have allowed federal contracts, loans, grants and the tax code to reward companies that prioritize their own profit over the livelihoods of American workers,\" said Rep. Pocan. \"Congress must incentivize companies to invest in American jobs, workers, and communities. In the first two years of the Trump administration, almost 200,000 jobs were outsourced and federal contractors that offshored jobs received almost $51 billion in contracts. This administration is bleeding the middle class dry while showering tax breaks on corporations that outsource strong family-supporting jobs – we must take action to stop it. The End Outsourcing Act is a necessary first step to bring jobs back to our country and put American workers first.\"Too many businesses in the United States have sent domestic manufacturing jobs overseas to low-cost, low-wage countries as companies aim to cut costs and increase profit. Meanwhile, families and communities in states across the country are feeling the loss. Between 2001 and 2015, the United States lost more than three million jobs to China alone--nearly three quarters in manufacturing. The End Outsourcing Act is designed to reverse this trend and ensure that federal contracts, loans, and grants funded by taxpayers support companies that employ American workers.The End Outsourcing Act is cosponsored in the Senate by U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin and Gary Peters and will be introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI-02). The legislation has also received the endorsement of several labor unions, including: the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, United Steelworkers, Communications Workers of America, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the American Federation of Labor.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), today introduced the Food Worker Pay Standards Act which would ensure that the federal government only purchases food produced by workers who earn fair pay and benefits.The bill would direct the Secretary of Labor to use local wages and benefits for food production workers in conjunction with local collective bargaining agreements to establish a regional prevailing wage and would prevent the federal government from purchasing food produced by workers paid less than those prevailing rates. This standard would apply to meat, meat food product, poultry, poultry food product, and processed food workers.\"The federal government should not be in the business of rewarding companies with taxpayer-funded contracts if they don\\'t pay or protect their workers adequately,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"Workers in the food processing industry are disproportionately workers of color, and the time is long overdue to protect their dangerous jobs with federal guardrails. This bill will signal to food processing companies nationwide that the federal government is only willing to work with businesses that put workers first. Anything less will not be funded by the American people.\" \"The Food Worker Pay Standards Act is a strong investment in American workers in our country\\'s meatpacking and food processing industries,\" said Marc Perrone, International President of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW). \"By setting high standards for companies that receive billions of taxpayer dollars in federal contracts, Congress is sending a powerful message that these jobs need to be good jobs that put food safety and workers first. As the largest union representing America\\'s food workers, UFCW is proud to support this legislation. We urge Congress to stand up for good jobs in this industry by passing this bill and sending it to the president\\'s desk for his signature.\"Food production and processing workers face dangerous conditions and federal contracting should not undermined the high standards that workers have secured through bargaining with their employers. Ice cream producers suffer injury and illness at more than twice the rate of other workers and pork slaughterhouses have a turnover rate of nearly 100% annually. Federal contracts should improve - not undermine – wages and benefits for workers.The legislation is endorsed by the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW); AFL-CIO; Bakery, Confectionery, and Tobacco Workers & Grain Millers (BCTGM).This legislation is co-sponsored by Anthony Brown (D-MD), André Carson (D-IN), Danny Davis (D-IL), Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), Marcia Fudge (D-OH), Jesus \"Chuy\" García (D-IL), Deb Haaland (D-NM), Jahana Hayes (D-CT), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Robin Kelly (D-IL), Ro Khanna (D-CA), Dan Kildee (D-MI), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Andy Levin (D-MI), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Grace Napolitano (D-CA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Jamie Raskin (D-MD), Linda Sánchez (D-CA), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), Paul Tonko (D-NY), Norma Torres (D-CA), Lori Trahan (D-MA), David Trone (D-MD), Maxine Waters (D-CA).',\n",

       "  'text': 'U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) led a letter on behalf of Air Wisconsin flight attendants, represented by the Association of Flight Attendants-Communications Workers of America (AFA-CWA), urging the National Mediation Board (NMB) to give fair consideration to AFA-CWA\\'s request to advance the contract negotiation process.The Air Wisconsin flight attendants\\' wages have been frozen since 2007, and after negotiating contracts for almost four years, and over two years in mediation, the flight attendants voted to authorize a strike in November of 2018. However, due to restrictions in the Railway Labor Act, the NMB is the only body that can intervene and progress negotiations to allow for arbitration or subsequently a strike. Despite repeated requests from the AFA, the NMB has failed to take action.\"Air Wisconsin flight attendants are trapped in poverty wages as their voices are ignored by executives at Air Wisconsin and United Airlines,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"Four years of contract negotiations and over a decade of stagnant wages is not good faith bargaining, it\\'s not even good management. When workers organize and vote to strike, they deserve to exercise that right. The National Mediation Board must take action to allow these negotiations to progress. Anything less is inadequate and does not do justice to the hard work of flight attendants that keeps airline passengers safe each and every day.\"\"There is no excuse for the pace or length of negotiations with Air Wisconsin,\" said Sara Nelson, AFA International President. \"While contracts do not expire under the Railway Labor Act, the statute has clear parameters to move to a strike deadline when the parties are no longer moving toward an agreement. It has been two years since this management made any movement in negotiations, even with the assistance of federal mediators. Flight Attendants meanwhile are earning poverty wages and often can\\'t afford a place to live. The National Mediation Board needs to move forward as the law intended to bring negotiations to a close. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA thanks Representative Pocan and all of the co-signers for calling on the agency to follow the law and bring these negotiations to a close.\"The letter was also signed by Linda T.

       "  'date': 'July 18, 2019',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (July 18, 2019) – Today, U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), joined U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) to unveil the Stop Wall Street Looting Act. The comprehensive bill fundamentally reforms the private equity industry and levels the playing field by forcing private equity firms to take responsibility for the outcomes of companies they take over, empowering workers, and protecting investors.\"With the help of our rigged tax code, private equity firms have made out like bandits at the expense of workers and communities. Private investment funds should not be able to cash out by gambling with the wellbeing of hard-working families,\" said Pocan. \"When the private equity firm Sun Capital bought Shopko – a retail chain that\\'s been in business for over 50 years – they loaded it up with debt, sending it into bankruptcy and leaving their workers with no severance and few options. After many employees spent years – some decades – working for Shopko, they were abruptly left out in the cold with nowhere to turn. This critical piece of legislation holds predatory private equity firms accountable and protects workers from the consequences of firms\\' greed.\"\"This bold legislation stands firm against Wall Street and private equity firms by protecting workers from abusive practices that eliminate jobs and topple markets,\" said Jayapal. \"My colleagues and I are taking the powerful steps this issue deserves – we are listening to the families, workers and small businesses that deserve fair treatment.\"\"For far too long, Washington has looked the other way while private equity firms take over companies, load them with debt, strip them of their wealth, and walk away scot-free – leaving workers, consumers, and whole communities to pick up the pieces,\" said Warren. \"Our bill ends these abusive practices by putting private investment funds on the hook for the decisions made by the companies they control, ending looting, empowering workers and investors, and safeguarding the markets from risky corporate debt.\"\"An out of state, predatory private equity firm shut down stores across Wisconsin and nearly 3,000 ShopKo workers lost their job. We need to rip up the predatory playbook that private equity firms are using to leave workers with nothing but pink slips,\" said Baldwin. \"Our legislation takes on Wall Street abuse and closes loopholes that private equity firms are using to make a quick buck while they shut down businesses and lay off workers. This bold reform will help rewrite the rules of our economy and protect workers from predatory practices so that we can start rewarding hard work and not just wealth.\"\"Workers\\' jobs, benefits, and pensions have been wiped out by private equity executives looking to make a quick buck,\" said Brown. \"The Stop Wall Street Looting Act will protect hardworking Ohio families by ending the risky bets that cripple Main Street companies for the benefit of Wall Street.\"Over the last two decades, private equity activity in the economy has exploded. Since 2009, investors have allocated $5.8 trillion globally to private equity. These funds have purchased companies in all sectors of the economy – from nursing homes, to newspapers, to grocery stores – laying off hundreds of thousands of workers and ruining thousands of companies in the process. Today, 35,000 companies owned by private equity employ nearly 5.8 million workers.The private equity industry claims that it earns high returns for investors by leveraging their capital to buy companies, using funds\\' management expertise to make the companies\\' operations more efficient, and then selling the companies at a profit. In reality, private equity funds often load up companies with debt, strip them of their assets, and extract exorbitant fees, while guaranteeing payouts for themselves and walking away from workers, communities, and investors if the bets go bad.The Stop Wall Street Looting Act would fundamentally reform private equity by closing the legal, tax, and regulatory loopholes that allow private equity firms to capture all the rewards of their investments while insulating themselves from risk. Firms that take appropriate steps in the interest of the company, the fund, and workers, will continue to make investments.  The bill would:Require Private Investment Funds to Have Skin in the Game. Firms will share responsibility for the liabilities of companies under their control including debt, legal judgments and pension-related obligations to better align the incentives of private equity firms and the companies they own. In order to encourage more responsible use of debt, the bill ends the tax subsidy for excessive leverage, and closes the carried interest loophole. End Looting of Portfolio Companies. To give portfolio companies a shot at success, the proposal bans dividends to investors for two years after a firm is acquired and ends the extraction of wealth from acquired companies through excessive fees. Protect Workers, Customers, and Communities. This proposal prevents private equity firms from walking away when a company fails and protects stakeholders by:\\t\\tPrioritizing worker pay in the bankruptcy process, and improving rules so workers are more likely to receive severance, pensions, and other payments they earned.Creating incentives for job retention so that workers can benefit from a company\\'s second chance.Ending the immunity of private equity firms from legal liability when their portfolio companies break the law, including the WARN Act. When workers at a plant are shortchanged or residents at a nursing home are hurt because private equity firms force portfolio companies to cut corners, the firm should be liable. Clarifying that gift cards are consumer deposits, ensuring their priority in bankruptcy.Empower Investors by Increasing Transparency. Private equity managers will be required to disclose fees, returns, and political expenditures so that investors can monitor their investments and shop around.Require Regulators to Address Risky Leverage. The Dodd-Frank provisions that require arrangers of corporate debt securitization to retain some of the risk will be reinstated.Joining the lawmakers in introducing the legislation are U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and U.S. Representatives Barbara Lee (CA-13), Jesús \"Chuy\" García (IL-04), Ayanna Pressley (MA-07), Rashida Tlaib (MI-13), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), Ro Khanna (CA-17), and Raúl Grijalva (AZ-03).###',\n",

Pocan is one of the authors of the legislation and led his colleagues in introducing the bill earlier this year.\"Today the House of Representatives fulfilled a promise we made to the American people – to pass legislation that would raise wages for millions of workers. American workers are among the most productive in the world, but in most industries, wages have stagnated, while the share going to profits and the top 1% has soared,\" said Pocan. \"The Raise the Wage Act gives a well-deserved raise to nearly a quarter of the workforce and takes a step in the right direction to level the playing field. When workers have more money in their pockets, they have more money to spend to care for their families and stimulate our economy. Now that the House has acted, Senate Majority Leader McConnell should listen to American workers and bring this bill up for a vote.\"The Raise the Wage Act will:Increase wages for up to 33 million American workers, including 829,000 workers in Wisconsin;Lift 1.3 million Americans out of poverty, including 600,000 children, according to the CBO\\'s review of a similar proposal; andHelp secure fairness and equality for women, giving nearly 20 million working women a raise, and helping narrow the gender wage gap that disproportionately impacts women of color.###',\n",

U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) reintroduced companion legislation in the Senate.The bipartisan bill would deter companies from sending American jobs overseas and incentivize them to locate in the United States by creating a public list consisting of companies that sent call center work overseas. Being on the list would make these actors ineligible for federal grants or guaranteed loans. The bill would also require overseas call centers to disclose their locations to customers and would require them to comply with consumers\\' requests to be transferred to a service agent physically located in the United States.\"When corporations offshore American jobs, our communities and workers suffer the consequences, just so corporations can pay lower wages than what workers in the U.S. make,\" said Pocan. \"The U.S. Call Center Worker and Consumer Protection Act is smart policy – supported by both Republicans and Democrats – that will help keep call center jobs in the U.S. and help prevent the loss of economic activity in communities across the country.

       "  'title': 'Pocan Leads Democrats in Introducing Bill to Raise the Minimum Wage',\n",
       "  'date': 'January 16, 2019',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) today joined House and Senate leadership to introduce the Raise the Wage Act of 2019. The bill would gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2024, index future minimum wage increases to median wage growth, and ensure all workers are paid at least the full federal minimum wage by phasing out the subminimum wages for tipped workers, youth workers, and workers with disabilities.Pocan joined U.S. Representatives Bobby Scott (VA-03), Chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor, Stephanie Murphy (FL-07), and Donald Norcross (NJ-01) in leading the introduction of the Raise the Wage Act in the House of Representatives with 181 cosponsors.\"More than a decade after Congress last voted to raise the minimum wage, no family in the United States can live on $7.25 an hour. Raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do and long past due. While some cities and states have led on this issue, we must raise the wage everywhere – from Madison, Wisconsin, to Mobile, Alabama – to ensure that every American worker can succeed. Every Member of Congress should recognize the urgent need to raise the wage, and if they support a salary of only $15,080 per year, they should be forced to live on it. I\\'m proud to co-sponsor this legislation and I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance it through the 116th Congress,\" said Congressman Mark Pocan.\\u200b\"A $15 federal minimum wage affirms the bedrock idea of fairness in our country: that hard work deserves a decent wage. We will open up opportunities for working families and drive economic growth that lifts up all communities – because our economy works best when it works for everyone, not just the wealthy and privileged few. I commend Chairman Bobby Scott and all our House Democrats for their leadership for America\\'s working men and women, who are the backbone of our country,\" said Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\"I was proud to help lead the charge to increase the minimum wage the last time Democrats held the House Majority. It has been too long since workers have received the raise they deserve. Democrats promised to improve economic opportunities for workers and their families in the 2018 election, and the introduction today of the Raise the Wage Act as one of our first bills in the Majority demonstrates our intention to keep that promise. I look forward to working with Chairman Scott and Education and Labor Committee Democrats to bring this legislation to the Floor following Committee consideration,\" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.\"No person working full-time in America should be living in poverty. The Raise the Wage Act will increase the pay and standard of living for nearly 40 million workers across this country. Raising the minimum wage is not only good for workers, it is good for businesses, and good for the economy. When we put money in the pockets of American workers, they will spend that money in their communities. This bill is a stimulus for Main Street America,\" said Chairman Bobby Scott, Committee on Education and Labor.\"Over the last decade, most working families have seen an increase in the cost of almost everything they need, yet their wages have barely moved. No person who has the dignity of a full time job should face the indignity of not being able to provide for themselves and their loved ones. This bill will finally give hardworking families in central Florida a much-needed raise - putting more money in their pockets to spend at small businesses and helping to grow our economy for everyone,\" said Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy.\"I\\'ve worked for minimum wage and I was once a young single dad raising my son and having to balance work, family life and a checkbook. Back then it was hard. Today, for far too many Americans, it\\'s nearly impossible. No American who works full-time should live in poverty. But that\\'s exactly what\\'s happening all around us, and Congress hasn\\'t even voted to raise wages in over 11 years. When people finally receive $15 an hour, they\\'ll spend more, become less reliant on government assistance and give our economy a needed boost,\" said Congressman Donald Norcross.Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a companion bill in the Senate with 31 cosponsors.\"Just a few short years ago, we were told that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour was ‘radical.\\' But a grassroots movement of millions of workers throughout this country refused to take ‘no\\' for an answer. It is not a radical idea to say a job should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it. The current $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage is a starvation wage. It must be increased to a living wage of $15 an hour,\" said Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT).\"For a long time, Democrats have been trying to raise the minimum wage to keep pace with the times. The harsh truth of the matter is that the minimum wage is now a poverty wage in too many parts of America. And no American with a full-time job should be living in poverty. Despite campaigning as a champion for working Americans, President Trump has abandoned working Americans while in office. He\\'s tried to strip away workers\\' health care, given a massive tax cut to corporations and the wealthy, and used workers as bargaining chips in shutting the government down. If President Trump isn\\'t going to stick up for American workers on key issues such as raising the minimum wage, Democrats will,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\"There are millions of women and men across the country who work a full-time job, or work multiple jobs, and are still unable to pay their bills and make ends meet. Women make up almost two-thirds of minimum wage earners and it\\'s even worse for women of color. So I\\'m proud to introduce the Raise the Wage Act today as one of the many steps we can take to ensure workers, especially the millions of women supporting their families, have the economic security to build better lives,\" said Senator Murray, Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.To read the bill text of the Raise the Wage Act, click here.To read the section-by-section of the Raise the Wage Act, click here.To read a fact sheet on Raise the Wage Act, click here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (November 1, 2018) – Today, U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Lloyd Doggett (TX-35), Ranking Member of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Tax Policy, wrote to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to request an investigation on the effectiveness of economic development subsidies, such as those provided to Foxconn Technology Group in Wisconsin. This request comes as the Center for American Progress released a new issue brief on the hidden impacts of these business incentives, including potential downsides often not considered by lawmakers, the press, or the general public.\"As incomes for the many workers have stagnated in recent decades, policymakers have looked to other tools to spur jobs and wages. Economic development has become a top policy priority. This is especially true at the state and local level, where elected officials have become increasingly willing to provide subsidies to incentivize business location or relocation as a means of job creation,\" wrote Pocan and Doggett.\"According to the Upjohn Institute, these subsidies have tripled since 1990. For example, in Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker and the state legislature passed a law that would provide up to $4.5 billion in public funding to subsidize Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer,\" continued Pocan and Doggett. \"Under even the most optimistic assumptions, the state is not expected to break even on the deal until 2043, decades after these officials will have left office.\"Specifically, Pocan and Doggett are requesting the GAO conduct a review and issue a report on the following questions:Are there reliable empirical analyses of the net economic effects of these economic development subsidies?  Based on any available evidence of economic development incentives affecting business location decisions, what economic impacts have such incentives generated?To what extent have large federal economic development programs been used to provide incentives impacting business location decisions and what evaluations have the federal agencies conducted to determine economic impact? How does the federal government evaluate the effectiveness of economic development policies within the federal agencies? Have such evaluations taken into account the incentives provided by state and local governments in incentive packages provided to businesses?What kind of coordination takes place among federal agencies, such as the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development and the Small Business Administration, and state and local governments?Given the apparent expansion of such activities by state and local governments, what actions have federal agencies taken to enforce relocation and other provisions intended to ensure that program purposes are met?What improvements can be made to processes at the federal, state and local levels to better understand the effectiveness of economic development programs and to what extent can federal authorities encourage further transparency in economic development?The full letter is available here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (June 27, 2018) – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement regarding the U.S. Supreme Court\\'s ruling in Janus v. AFSCME, which undermines public sector unions\\' long-held practice of collecting \"fair share fees\" for the services they are legally required to provide workers.\"The Supreme Court\\'s decision in Janus v. AFSCME will have far-reaching effects for millions of American workers. The fact is that when unions are strong, workers have better wages, better working conditions, and ultimately, better lives. However, when unions are under attack and weakened by corporate and special interests, workers suffer. Today, President Trump and the GOP\\'s donors won the latest battle in stripping protections for workers and further rigging the system in favor of millionaires and billionaires.\"As a 30-year union member and a lifelong resident of Wisconsin, I have witnessed first-hand the positive effects that unions can have on people\\'s lives, as well as the destructive results when politicians, like Wisconsin\\'s own Scott Walker, attack worker\\'s rights. Despite today\\'s Supreme Court ruling, I\\'m committed to fighting for public employees and ensuring that unions can continue to make a difference in working peoples\\' lives.\"Earlier this year, I introduced the Workplace Democracy Act, legislation that restores real bargaining rights to workers and repeals the right to work laws like those that Governor Walker has used to undercut American workers. We must stand up for the millions of middle class families who are under attack by Republican leaders and rulings like the one delivered today by the Supreme Court.\"Pocan introduced the Workplace Democracy Act in the U.S. House of Representatives in May 2018 and it currently has 58 co-sponsors. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced companion legislation in the U.S. Senate and it currently has 16 co-sponsors. The legislation would make it easier for workers to join unions in a number of ways:It would end \"right to work for less\" laws by repealing Section 14(b) of the Taft Hartley Act, which has allowed 28 states to pass legislation eliminating the ability of unions to collect fair share fees from those who benefit from union contracts and activities.Under the legislation, when a majority of workers in a bargaining unit sign valid authorization cards to join a union, they must have a union. Companies would not be allowed to deny or delay a first contract with workers who have voted to join a union. Unions would be given the right to have their voice heard through secondary boycotts and picketing. And workers would have the right to know when their company spends millions of dollars running anti-union campaigns.The bill would also stop employers from ruthlessly exploiting workers by misclassifying them as independent contractors or denying them overtime by falsely categorizing them as a \"supervisor.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (May 9, 2018) – Today, U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) joined U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and their colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to introduce legislation that would strengthen the middle class by restoring workers\\' rights to bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions.\"Republicans like President Trump and Governor Walker continue to crack down on unions and push a special interest, corporate-driven agenda that makes it harder for middle class families to get ahead. And while they stack the deck against the American worker, unions are fighting to expand economic opportunity and strengthen the middle class,\" said Pocan, a member of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades. \"The Workplace Democracy Act restores real bargaining rights to workers and repeals the right to work laws like those that Governor Walker has used to undercut American workers. I\\'m proud to introduce this legislation with Senator Sanders and stand up for the millions of middle class families who are under attack by Republican leaders.\"\"We must no longer tolerate CEOs and managers who intimidate, threaten or fire pro-union workers, who threaten to move plants to China if their workers vote in favor of a union, and who refuse to negotiate a first contract with workers who have voted to join unions,\" Sanders said. \"If we are serious about reducing income and wealth inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we have got to substantially increase the number of union jobs in this country.\"Unions lead to higher wages, better benefits and a more secure retirement. Union workers earn 26 percent more, on average, than non-union workers. Union workers are also half as likely to be victims of health and safety violations or of wage theft, 18 percent more likely to have health coverage, and 23 percent more likely to have either an employer sponsored pension or 401(k).However, the rights of workers to join together and bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions have been severely undermined. Sixty years ago, nearly a third of all workers belonged to a union. Today, that number has gone down to less than 11 percent. When workers become interested in forming unions, 75 percent of private-sector employers hire outside consultants to run anti-union campaigns. An employee who engages in union organizing campaigns has a one in five chance of getting fired.\"The biggest economic challenge of our time is that people are in jobs that do not pay them enough to live on. While corporate profits soar, working people are getting smaller and smaller shares of the wealth they create. Corporate interests are highly organized and fight like hell to make sure their interests are protected—in the economy and in our political system,\" Rep. RosaDeLauro said. \"The Workplace Democracy Act aims squarely at that issue by simplifying the process for workers to form a union. We know that when workers are able to collectively bargain, they achieve increased wages and more substantial benefits—like healthcare coverage and retirement security. That is why Congress needs to act immediately on this legislation to make it as easy as possible for people to organize into unions and fight for a fairer economy.\"\"Workers win when they band together and use their voices to raise wages and standards in the workplace,\" said Rep. Donald Norcross, a member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce and electrician by trade. \"I know how important it is for working families to work together because I lived it. I fought for them at the negotiating table for decades. Now we must fight back against attacks on democracy in the workplace. We need to come together and pass this act to help restore workers\\' rights.\"The Workplace Democracy Act would make it easier for workers to join unions in a number of ways:It would end right to work for less laws by repealing Section 14(b) of the Taft Hartley Act, which has allowed 28 states to pass legislation eliminating the ability of unions to collect fair share fees from those who benefit from union contracts and activities.Under the legislation, when a majority of workers in a bargaining unit sign valid authorization cards to join a union, they must have a union.

With a comparatively paltry investment from the federal government over ten years – less than one-tenth of 1% of GDP – and no dedicated funding for rural broadband, the Administration\\'s plan falls far short in resources, leaving many communities behind.\"The reality is that President Trump\\'s plan is nothing more than an attempt to sell off public resources to Wall Street, to members of Mar-a-Lago, and to foreign investors. We need a real, comprehensive public investment that goes beyond traditional infrastructure, and covers not just our roads and bridges, but our water systems, broadband, and clean, renewable energy, as the Progressive Caucus has put forward in our 21st Century New Deal for Jobs.

Rather than reward companies that relocate to other countries, we should use our tax code to incentivize firms to invest in our communities and put American workers back on the job.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (October 24, 2017) – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) today introduced the Contractor Accountability and Workplace Safety Act, legislation that would help ensure that companies contracting with the federal government maintain safe workplaces. The legislation comes as President Trump has revoked the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order, which required companies to disclose past labor law violations when bidding for large federal contracts. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has introduced companion legislation in the U.S. Senate.\"Rather than stand up for the hardworking men and women of this nation, President Trump has decided to side with crooked contractors and corporate interests. When he revoked the Fair Pay and Workplaces Executive Order earlier this year, President Trump exposed American workers to potentially dangerous conditions that could have deadly results,\" said Pocan. \"When the federal government grants a contract, workers should have the assurance that their work place is safe and their employer does not have a history overrun with labor law violations. The Contractor Accountability and Workplace Safety Act would restore many protections for workers and help ensure that the U.S. government allocates federal taxpayer dollars responsibly.\"\"Every American deserves a safe workplace, but too often, federal contractors break labor laws and endanger their employees while continuing to suck down millions of dollars in government contracts,\" said Warren. \"This legislation will help ensure that companies that threaten the health and safety of their workers won\\'t receive another dime from American taxpayers.\"Existing regulations require that contracting officers within the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) make a determination of responsibility of a prospective contractor to evaluate its \"business ethics.\" However, the requirement is generally interpreted to relate to efficiency and costs, rather than worker safety. This bill would require contracting officers, when considering a bid for a contract worth more than $1,000,000, to:Consult the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\\'s inspection database for past safety and health violations by the bidder or relevant subcontractors known to the DOD;Consider any violations he/she identifies as part of the bid\\'s \"responsibility determination;\" andRefer violations to the DOD\\'s suspension and debarment official.The bill would also require the DOD to train contracting officials on how to evaluate safety as part of the responsibility determination. Lastly, the bill requires the Government Accountability Office to evaluate the DOD\\'s procedures for evaluating contractors\\' safety records, the incidence of safety violations among DOD contractors, whether the Department of Labor (DOL) has the resources to investigate violations among DOD contractors, and whether the DOL should consider expanding its investigatory role into DOD contractors.The legislation has been endorsed by the AFL-CIO, Center for American Progress Action Fund, Economic Policy Institute (EPI), International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Allied Workers, International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers (BAC), International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE), International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), National Council for Occupational Safety and Health (National COSH), National Employment Law Project (NELP), Service Employees International Union (SEIU), and the United Association of Plumbers, Pipefitters, Sprinklerfitters and Service Techs (UA).Joining Pocan as original cosponsors of the legislation are U.S. Representatives David Cicilline (RI-01), John Conyers (MI-13), Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11), Marcy Kaptur (OH-09), Jim McGovern (MA-02), Jerrold Nadler (NY-10), Donald Norcross (NJ-01), Frank Pallone (NJ-06), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), and Mark Takano (CA-41).',\n",

The Access to Jobs Task Force will help workers achieve their full potential by expanding access to capital, encouraging entrepreneurship and small business ownership, increasing educational opportunities – including vocational skills development, professional licensing, and apprenticeship training – and eliminating senseless and outdated social barriers to work that affect many communities.Click here to watch the full video.Here are the remarks, as delivered:Thank you, Julia, and thanks to Joe and Linda for putting this together—and all my other colleagues for being here. When you hear us talk about better jobs, better wages, and a better future, let me try to put it another way coming from America's heartland, from Wisconsin.It's really what people talk about at their kitchen tables—can they afford their mortgage or rent, can they have health care for their family, can they take a family vacation, can they send their kids to college if they want to go. That's what people actually talk about.Just contrast that with what we're doing right now in Congress. We've spent the first eight months trying to take away health care from 20 million people, we want to now cut taxes for the wealthiest in this country, and some people are willing to shut down government over a wall.Well, I can tell you in Paul Ryan's district, which is the neighboring district to mine, if the wall means you're keeping employers in, they might support that, but 25,000 people used to make cars in the 1st Congressional District, in Paul Ryan's district—no one does today.The subcommittee that I'm on, along with Ami Bera, Marc Veasey, and Lisa Blunt Rochester, is to talk specifically about access to jobs, what we can do to help do that—that covers everything from higher education, apprenticeships, access to capital, entrepreneurship.Those are the goals that we have with this committee, and we are up to the task and look forward to making sure that our caucus continues to focus on what's most important to people across the country, and that's talking about jobs and wages, something the Republicans simply aren't doing.And it is my honor to introduce, I believe the word is spectacular I am supposed to use, Representative from Pennsylvania, Brendan Boyle.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (August 1, 2017) – In advance of a closely watched vote to unionize a Nissan Motor Co. manufacturing plant this Thursday and Friday in Canton, Mississippi, 18 members of Congress sent President Trump a sharply worded letter this week, urging him to publicly support the collective bargaining rights of the Mississippi auto workers and asking that he demand that Nissan \"shift its posture towards the organizing drive at the facility in Canton to neutral.\"The Nissan factory—partly owned by Japanese and French investors, including the French government—is one of the company\\'s only plants throughout the world without a union or any meaningful worker representation. The U.S. Representatives note that working conditions at the factory have been plagued with threats against employees and \"hazards that were causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm.\"According to press reports, workers have been compelled to attend large group meetings on the dangers of unions and endure warnings from supervisors of a potential plant closure and lower incomes, leading the National Labor Relations Board to charge the company with violating workers\\' rights.\"On the campaign trail, candidate Trump denounced the way that foreign companies take advantage of an economic system that\\'s rigged against ordinary workers,\" said Rep.Mark Pocan (WI-02). \"The fight in Canton is the clearest example of this. Unlike any other Nissan employees in the rest of the industrialized world, American workers have been forced to swallow relentless anti-union propaganda from Nissan managers in the days and weeks leading up to this vote. Such intimidation must stop. President Trump came to power promising people good jobs. Now is his chance to truly stand up to a foreign company bullying Americans into accepting lower wages and unsafe working conditions.\"\"The right to collective bargaining is one of the most fundamental rights of working Americans,\" said Rep. Debbie Dingell (MI-12). \"If President Trump is serious about standing up for the working men and women of this country, he should be willing to support efforts that ensure all Americans have the right to collectively bargain to improve their jobs and quality of life.\"The full letter is available here.',\n",

       "  'text': \"WASHINGTON, DC (July 25, 2017) – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) today joined House Democratic leaders to discuss their bold, new economic agenda and to present Americans with ‘A Better Deal' that will boost wages, lower costs, and unrig the economy so it works for all Americans, not special interests or just the wealthiest few.Click here to watch the full video.Here are the remarks, as delivered:Thank you, Annie. I'm here to represent the Progressive Caucus—Raúl Grijalva and I are co-chairs—that caucus is the largest values based caucus within our (Democratic) caucus, mid 70s in members.We have always said that the core economic issues are at the center of everything that we need to talk about, what people talk about at their kitchen table—whether or not they can afford their mortgage, have health insurance for their family, send their kids to college if they want to, or take a family vacation.Those are the core issues, and if we are going to talk to people about anything else that we care about—and there are many things we care about—we have to be centered around better jobs, better wages, and better a future.So we are glad to share these values with all the different caucuses within the Democratic Caucus. We are all on the same page, and if you look at the Republican Party, not only are they not on the same page, but they're not reading out of the same book, and whatever books they're reading from aren't even in the same language.So, we are glad to all be here, united around this core economic message that's so very important, and the Progressive Caucus is glad to work with everyone else in advancing these principles as we move forward. And it's my pleasure to introduce someone from my class, who is representing the New Dems, Scott Peters from San Diego, California.Here is Rep. Pocan's response to a question on apprenticeships:If I can just add real quick, I've been a small-business owner for nearly three decades, and one of the issues that we had up in Appropriations, which I serve on, last week is they also gutted every single dime of money for apprenticeship grants.One of our focuses is on apprenticeships, and we had the previous question, I think last week or two weeks ago, on a bill that I have called the LEARNS Act, where we are trying to expand apprenticeships and go beyond a traditional just building trades model into healthcare and IT and a lot of other areas.So apprenticeships are a way to give people the training and the skills that they need to get the jobs that are out there, and we are very focused on it. In contrast, Republicans are literally gutting every single dime, not just President Trump's budget, but the Congressional Republicans as well.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the Appropriations Committee\\'s Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee, introduced the Leveraging Effective Apprenticeships to Rebuild National Skills (LEARNS) Act. The LEARNS Act would increase the number of highly skilled workers in the United States and strengthens apprenticeship programs as an effective earn-and-learn model for students, workers, and employers.\"Wisconsin, home to the first state law establishing an apprenticeship program, has clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of the registered apprenticeship model over the last 100 years,\" said Representative Mark Pocan. \"The LEARNS Act seeks to build on the success of such programs by strengthening apprenticeship programs and helping prepare workers for careers in highly skilled professions. These apprenticeship programs are particularly effective when labor and management both have a seat at the table in developing the standards and curriculum, which is why I am proud to introduce this legislation with so many labor partners. The LEARNS Act is another commonsense step Congress can take to ensure workers are able to secure good-paying, family-supporting jobs.\"\"I thank Rep. Pocan for introducing the LEARNS Act to help close the skills gap and ensure American workers can compete for good jobs,\" said Democratic Whip Steny H. Hoyer (MD). \"Rep. Pocan has been a strong advocate for working families, and I hope we can advance this legislation so that more of our people have the skills to find well-paying jobs and make it in America.\"\"Registered apprenticeship programs offer on-the-job training and skills development that result in a nationally-recognized credential,\" said Education and the Workforce Ranking Member, Bobby Scott (VA-03). \"They not only empower workers to earn while they learn, but also provide them with knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in our nation\\'s high growth industries. The Leveraging Effective Apprenticeships to Rebuild National Skills (LEARNS) Act will provide the resources needed to ensure that these proven job training programs are accessible to employers and workers alike.  Registered apprenticeships are one of the most direct pathways to good jobs and the LEARNS Act will extend the benefits of these programs to more Americans.\"\"Apprenticeships are an essential tool in expanding economic opportunity to millions of American workers, as well as growing and strengthening the middle class,\" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, Ranking Member on the Appropriations subcommittee responsible for funding the Department of Labor. \"While President Trump\\'s budget makes disastrous cuts to our nation\\'s apprenticeship programs, the LEARNS Act would invest in these programs and ensure that apprenticeships are giving more workers the skills and tools they need to succeed. I am proud to join Rep. Pocan in cosponsoring this legislation and I strongly encourage my colleagues to Congress to support it.\"\"The men and women of the IUPAT thank Rep. Pocan for his ongoing fight for working families, and for his leadership in introducing the LEARNS Act,\" Kenneth Rigmaiden, General President – IUPAT. \"With well over 100 years\\' experience in building our great nation, the skilled crafts men and women of the Building Trades know that an apprenticeship is the gateway to a safe and successful career, with a solid foothold in the middle class. The passage of the LEARNS Act will ensure that the American workforce will learn the necessary and portable skills to meet the specific demands of employers and entire industries through qualified apprenticeship programs.\"The LEARNS Act will:Support closer alignment between registered apprenticeship programs, employers and other program sponsors offering good jobs,Increase the attainment of recognized postsecondary credentials by program participants,Create national standards for registered apprenticeship programs, andEstablish a permanent advisory council at the Department of Labor to oversee the actions and implementation of registered apprenticeship programs.The legislation is currently cosponsored by Reps. Bobby Scott (D-VA), Rosa L. DeLauro (D-CT), John Conyers (D-MI), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Raúl M.

Mark Pocan (WI-02) led a letter with 50 Members of Congress urging Santander Holding USA CEO Scott Powell to remain neutral as their employees decide whether they want union representation. Banco Santander already has 150,000 unionized workers throughout Europe and South America.In the letter, the Members write: \"We were disappointed to hear that, to date, Santander\\'s U.S. management has not responded to the workers\\' requests and has continued to discourage employees from participating in union activities, even on their own time.  We hope the company\\'s unwillingness to have a conversation with its employees about neutrality is not a harbinger of management\\'s opposition to their unionizing efforts.\"The text of the letter is below and an electronic copy can be found here.Dear Mr. Powell:We write to urge you to respect the rights of Santander Holdings USA (Santander) U.S. employees to choose whether they want union representation by staying neutral in the U.S. workers\\' organizing efforts. Banco Santander\\'s 150,000 unionized workers throughout Europe and South America have benefitted from union representation, and the nearly 10,000 U.S. workers deserve the opportunity to choose without pressure from Santander management whether collective bargaining is right for them.We understand that workers at Santander locations in the U.S., with the support of thousands of workers in eight countries, recently attempted to meet with management to ask the company to stay neutral in the U.S. workers\\' organizing efforts. We were disappointed to hear that, to date, Santander\\'s U.S. management has not responded to the workers\\' requests and has continued to discourage employees from participating in union activities, even on their own time.  We hope the company\\'s unwillingness to have a conversation with its employees about neutrality is not a harbinger of management\\'s opposition to their unionizing efforts.In fact, allowing Santander employees to organize, should they choose to do so, could ultimately prove beneficial to Santander U.S. A number of recent violations, ranging from illegal overdraft fees to unlawful repossessions of military servicemembers\\' vehicles, could ostensibly have been forestalled or prevented if employees operated under the protections provided by a union. Consider, too, the recent report by the Committee for Better Banks that sheds light on potential discriminatory lending practices, and whether a bank with a stronger relationship between management and employees would be better able to address these alleged violations and prevent future regulatory problems. Banco Santander\\'s global workforce has helped it grow from a regional institution to one of the world\\'s 10 largest banks.  In particular, it has implemented agreements in the countries where its workforce is unionized that have helped it to avoid certain abuses that have become more prevalent among U.S. banks.  Santander\\'s U.S. employees deserve the same opportunity to form a union if they choose, and we urge you to stay neutral in those organizing efforts.# # #',\n",

We desperately need immediate, strong, and meaningful Buy America policies to ensure that American tax dollars go to companies that employ American workers. But in his first months as President, we\\'ve yet to see Trump take meaningful action on Buy America.\"While Trump is announcing this Executive Order in Speaker Paul Ryan\\'s District, Republicans in Congress remain firmly opposed to expanding our Buy America standards.

In The Art of the Deal, President Trump urges readers to maximize their leverage, and to avoid looking desperate to make a deal.

By signing this misguided legislation, Trump is turning his back on federal contract workers rather than boosting wages and improving workplace safety. It\\'s unfortunate the President insists on hiding from the public while signing legislation that will hurt working Americans who elected him.\"Federal contractors have frequently been caught illegally underpaying their workers and violating wage and hour laws. More than 690 companies have been caught violating wage-related contractor labor laws multiple times and more than 300,000 workers have been the victims of wage-related labor violations while working under federal contracts in the last decade. # # #',\n",

He also suggested that a vote for the union would negatively impact workers throughout the region. In fact, the opposite is true. Study after study shows workers in unions earn more money. Further evidence demonstrates the benefits of unions go way beyond their own members, by raising the wages of non-unionized workers as well.\"Boeing employees voting in the bargaining unit on Wednesday should tune out unsolicited advice from elected officials, and consider the merits of the choice before them.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after House Republicans unveiled legislation which would implement \"right-to-work\" policies across the country.\"A national right-to-work law would be catastrophic for hard-working Americans across the country. As we have seen in other states, including my home state of Wisconsin, these right-to-work-for-less laws have nothing to do with helping businesses or creating jobs. These laws are a means to ensure greater corporate control of our politics and our society. They reduce wages and salaries for workers, cut benefits such as health insurance and a pension, and diminish workers\\' voices on workplace protections.\"When workers have a voice in their workplace the middle class is strong. And when the middle class is strong, America is strong. Unions raise standards across all industries, increasing the wages of both unionized and non-unionized workers. But yet again, House Republicans are ignoring the facts and putting partisanship and special interests above the livelihoods of workers. I hope Speaker Ryan is wise enough not to bring this bill to the floor.\"A recent Pew survey shows that 60% of Americans—an overwhelming majority—support unions. Also, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, union workers\\' wages are 27 percent greater than for non-union workers. Seventy-nine percent of unionized workers receive health insurance from their employers, compared to only 49 percent of non-union workers. Seventy-six percent of union workers have guaranteed defined-benefit pension plans, compared to only 16 percent of non-union workers. Eighty-three percent of union workers receive paid sick leave compared to only 62 percent of non-union workers.',\n",

Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA) released the following statements after holding a press conference voicing opposition to President Trump\\'s Secretary of Labor nominee, Andy Puzder.  Andy Puzder has made a name for himself by peddling the idea that minimum wage hikes would force fast food companies to replace workers with robots and has consistently opposed attempts to raise wages for individuals living below the poverty line. \"Andy Puzder has consistently stood on the side of big business and failed to support workers,\" Rep. Mark Pocan said. \"Since 2004, the Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division found Puzder\\'s businesses committed over 1,000 violations. Being Secretary of Labor is about making sure working men and women of this country are treated with decency. The nomination of Andy Puzder is another broken promise to the American people. President Trump likes to talk and tweet about putting hard-working Americans first, but at the end of the day, he wants to make sure only big business and special interests have seats at the table.\"  \"Andy Puzder is exactly the opposite of who we want running the Department of Labor,\" Congressman Joe Crowley said. \"There is no doubt in my mind that as Labor Secretary, he would consistently back the interests of corporations above the interests of working families. I\\'ve long fought for a higher minimum wage and better protections for working Americans – the very things Andy Puzder has made a career working against. American working families need better than Andy Puzder.\"\"The American people deserve a Secretary of Labor who can be counted on to enforce wage and hour laws, workplace safety protections, and workers\\' civil rights,\" said Congressman Bobby Scott. \"In light of Mr. Puzder\\'s record, he has failed to carry the burden of proving that he will vigorously and effectively enforce the very laws his company has been found to violate. Therefore, the Senate HELP Committee has no choice but to reject his nomination.\"\"President Trump promised to serve the American worker in his inaugural address, yet in nominating Mr. Puzder to lead the Department of Labor, the American worker would be betrayed. Mr. Puzder has an extensive record of engaging in marketing tactics that degrade women, fighting against paying workers their hard earned overtime, opposing expansion of the Affordable Care Act, and even allegedly failing to pay some of his workers,\" said Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro. \"Mr. Puzder is the wrong choice to lead the Department of Labor and the Senate should not confirm him.\"\"Of all the cruel jokes played by President Trump on the working people who voted for him, the nomination of Andrew Puzder as Secretary of Labor is the cruelest yet,\" said Congressman DeSaulnier. \"Mr. Puzder has a proven record of exploiting his employees by making 487 times more than his lowest wage worker while refusing to pay a living wage; withholding overtime pay; favoring automation over working people; and running a chain of restaurants where 60 percent of the establishments where found to be in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. These actions should automatically disqualify Mr. Puzder from running the Department of Labor. So much for helping the 150 million working families that depend on the Department to protect them.\"\"Working people need a champion at the Labor Department,\" said AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Tefere Gebre. \"At best, Andy Puzder is an adversary. At worst, he is an enemy. We simply cannot afford to have a Labor Secretary who does not respect workers. We are opposing his nomination with the full weight of the labor movement.\" A live stream of the press conference can be found here.###',\n",

In recent decades, the livelihoods of these workers have been pulled out from beneath them. We have watched too many factories shutter their doors and too many workers lose their jobs, decimating these neighborhoods and leaving families behind. The frustration and despair felt by workers in our region is palpable, and the discourse during the year\\'s election detailing the lack of opportunity for the working class underscores the need for solutions to these challenges. Congress has a responsibility to address their concerns and work together to strengthen the economic stability of these communities.For these reasons, we urge Congress to prioritize the consideration and passage of legislation consistent with the following principles:1.         We should close loopholes in our tax code which reward companies that ship jobs overseas and punish companies that stay in the United States and invest in American workers.2.         Federal contracting and procurement policies should give preference to American labor and domestic-made goods so our taxpayer dollars benefit working class families in the United States.3.         We should increase investments in education and prepare workers for careers in advanced manufacturing and other industries that will be pivotal in the 21st century economy.4.         Trade Adjustment Assistance and retraining programs should be improved and expanded to give workers the opportunity to get back on their feet when confronting job displacement.5.         We should expand access to quality broadband services and increased telecommunications connectivity so all communities have the digital resources that are necessary to compete in our digital economy.6.         The promise of a secure retirement must be upheld by preserving benefits that workers have paid into and earned, including Social Security, Medicare, and workplace pension guarantees.Too many working class families in our districts have been left behind because of the outsourcing of American jobs. It is critical Congress takes immediate action to jumpstart the economic prosperity of these communities by passing legislation that adheres to the principles listed above. We hope you will stand with us and our constituents during the 115th Congress to advance these goals and revive the American Dream for workers across the country.# # #',\n",

Rep. Pocan and his colleagues also expressed concern over current loopholes and lax enforcement of the Buy America Act, particularly those related to shipbuilding.“If President-elect Trump is concerned with livelihood of American workers, he should take steps to ensure the Buy America Act is strongly and meaningfully enforced,” said Rep. Pocan. “Last week, House Republican leadership removed a provision to permanently require American steel and iron be used in our country’s water infrastructure. It is unthinkable for House Republicans to eliminate these Buy America requirements after they were voted on and passed by the Senate. President-elect Trump can and should ensure that enforcement of the Act is strengthened. It is his duty to stand up to Congressional Republican leadership when the allow taxpayer dollars to go to companies that ship jobs overseas.”“Wisconsin has one of the highest percentages of its workforce employed in the manufacturing sector,” continued Rep. Pocan. “Foundries across the state are scratching their heads wondering why Republicans would want to send taxpayer dollars to companies that ship jobs overseas. House Republicans claim to care about keeping jobs here in America, yet consistently rally around legislation that costs our country jobs.

       "  'date': 'October 21, 2016',\n",
       "  'text': \"WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) applauded the United States Department of Labor’s $50.5 million dollar investment to expand apprenticeships. The ApprenticeshipUSA grants will go to 37 states for the purpose of expanding apprenticeship and meeting the national goal set by President Obama to double the number of apprentices. United States Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez is scheduled to highlight the investment in Wisconsin, totaling $1.5 million, at Madison College later this morning.“I applaud the Obama Administration and Secretary Perez for the emphasis they have placed on expanding apprenticeships with these grants,” said Rep. Mark Pocan. “Wisconsin has been a leader in apprenticeship training since 1911, when we established the nation's first apprenticeship law, so it is fitting that Secretary Perez will announce these grants in the Badger state.”“It’s critical for us to support the development of more apprenticeship programs across the spectrum of industries in order to prepare more highly skilled workers for in-demand occupations,” continued Rep. Pocan. “We must provide workers and job seekers with better access to employment, education, training, and support programs to help them secure good, well-paying jobs.”“Under the Obama administration we’ve partnered with Congress, state and local officials, employers, educators, community organizations, and the workforce system to add 125,000 new apprentices since 2014, the largest increase in nearly a decade,” said U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez. “The ApprenticeshipUSA grants announced today will help continue this momentum and put apprenticeship front and center to develop the career-ready workforce that businesses need to compete in our global economy and deliver the skills that workers need to thrive on the job.” Since becoming a Member of Congress in January 2013, Congressman Pocan has been a leader on the expansion of apprenticeship. He authored the LEARNS Act, and has encouraged appropriators to include funding to expand apprenticeships. More than 90 percent of apprentices are employed after completing their programs, with an average starting wage above $60,000. There is also a substantial return on investment for employers — international studies suggest that for every dollar spent on apprenticeship, employers may get an average of $1.47 back in increased productivity and greater front-line innovation. Unfortunately, the Republican House FY2017 Budget terminates future funding for this program.###\",\n",

We respectfully urge you to direct all federal agencies to prohibit discrimination in federal government contracting and subcontracting based on the sexual orientation or gender identity of the business owner.There are an estimated 1.4 million LGBT-owned businesses in the United States – in Congressional districts in all 50 states – that represent an untapped well of innovation, job creation, and economic growth. However, no protections exist to prohibit discrimination against these businesses in federal procurement. The history of discrimination against LGBT individuals by the federal government and lack of any protections for LGBT-owned businesses perpetuate a sense among these businesses that the federal government is not open to them, and among major federal contractors that seeking out LGBT-owned suppliers is not necessary.LGBT-owned businesses have much to contribute and gain from federal government contracting opportunities. Ensuring that no barriers exist for LGBT-owned businesses in federal contracting will also benefit the federal government and American taxpayers by creating a larger and more visible pool of diverse suppliers who can provide goods and services to the federal government. It will also provide prime federal contractors with more options to find subcontractors that provide good value.Your Administration has already taken significant steps to ensure there is LGBT equality in federal contracting, particularly as it related to the employees of federal contractors.  Now it is time to finish the job and ensure that contractors and subcontractors themselves cannot face discrimination either.We look forward to working with you to ensure that the federal government is clearly opening its doors for business with the LGBT community. # # #',\n",

However, after the skilled unit voted to form a union in 2015, the company sought to invalidate the election.

As a result of the company’s appeal, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) reviewed the election results, and it found that the skilled trades employees were qualified to join their own union and had successfully voted to do so.  In our opinion and as a matter of public policy, we believe that when labor and management bargain in good faith, the best outcomes are realized for all parties.  We are concerned the company has chosen such a tactic against the workers at your Chattanooga plant given the company’s global reputation for supporting and collaborating with its workers.  From the beginning, Volkswagen objected to the skilled trades workers’ effort to form a union.  Even after the workers won their election, the company challenged the results, which were certified a second time by the NLRB.  Now that the company lost its appeal with the NLRB, you have stated your intent to pursue a different result in court.  In response to the dilatory tactics, the NLRB issued an Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) Complaint against Volkswagen on April 26, 2016 (10-CA-166500 and 10-CA-169340), charging the company with violating American law by failing to collectively bargain with the UAW on behalf of the skilled trades workers. Given the serious nature of the issues involved in this matter and the potential impact they could have on relations between Germany and the United States, we ask that you respond to each of the concerns raised throughout this note. As practitioners of public policy, it’s critical for us to understand the circumstances that might lead some workers’ voices not to be heard. # # #',\n",

       "  'title': 'Pocan Introduces Bill to Invest in Apprenticeships and Rebuild Workforce Skills',\n",
       "  'date': 'July 6, 2016',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, introduced the Leveraging Effective Apprenticeships to Rebuild National Skills (LEARNS) Act. The LEARNS Act would increase the number of highly skilled workers in the United States and ensures the registered apprenticeship program is an effective earn-and-learn model for students, workers, and employers.“A highly skilled workforce is necessary to compete in today’s global economy,” Rep. Pocan said. “The LEARNS Act strengthens apprenticeship programs and helps prepare workers for careers in highly skilled professions. I am proud to introduce this legislation so we can continue building on the successes of the apprenticeship model and help workers secure good-paying jobs.”“I’m proud to include legislation introduced by Rep. Pocan in the new Make It in America plan,” stated Whip Hoyer. “Last year, I was pleased he joined me during our ‘Make It In America: What’s Next’ hearing series to discuss how expanding apprenticeships can help workers obtain the necessary skills training to fill good-paying jobs. His bill – the LEARNS Act – would do just that, increasing the number of skilled workers in the U.S. and helping to close the skills gap. I look forward to working with him to advance this bill and other ideas included in the new Make It In America plan, and I thank him for his commitment to ensuring more of our workers can make it in America.”“The Leveraging Effective Apprenticeships to Rebuild National Skills (LEARNS) Act will help ensure that young people and families all across the United States have access to the skills, job stability, and income that registered apprenticeship programs can provide,” said Congressman Bobby Scott, Ranking Member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. “The legislation would also make more resources available to companies that want to start and continue registered apprenticeship programs. Apprenticeships are one of the most direct pathways to good jobs and the LEARNS Act will extend the benefits of these programs to more Americans.”Over the next decade, approximately 45 percent of all jobs will be in “middle-skill” occupations, which require more than a high school diploma but less than a bachelor’s degree. The registered apprenticeship program is a vital element of training for these “middle skill” occupations and helps individuals contribute to their personal economic stability and an effective workforce.The LEARNS Act will:Support a closer alignment between registered apprenticeship programs, employers and other program sponsors offering good jobs,Increase the attainment of recognized postsecondary credentials by program participants,Create national standards for registered apprenticeship programs, andEstablish a permanent advisory council at the Department of Labor to oversee the actions and implementation of registered apprenticeship programs.The legislation is currently cosponsored by Reps. Bobby Scott (D-VA), John Conyers (D-MI), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Donald Payne Jr. (D-NJ), Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Jared Polis (D-CO), Mike Honda (D-CA), Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Gwen S. Moore (D-WI), James Langevin (D-RI), Earl Blumenauer, (D-OR), Raúl M.

Over 200 Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have expressed opposition to this agreement along with a collation of European and U.S. airlines. I will continue to work with my colleagues so that American carriers are not undercut because of this flawed decision.” The Department of Transportation has opened a public comment period running until May 6th to hear objections and concerns.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement in support of the nearly 40,000 Verizon workers from Massachusetts to Virginia poised to strike tomorrow for a fair contract.“Companies should pay their workers fair wages and guarantee workplace protections. As a small business owner, I know the value of loyal, well-trained, and hard-working employees. I also know how important it is that all parties share in a company’s success. It is unacceptable for Verizon to continue amassing massive profits, while their workers lack job security and struggle to make ends meet. I support the workers striking tomorrow in their demand for a fair contract.”The Communications Workers of American (CWA) and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), who represent the workers, have already agreed to health care cost reductions. However, negotiations have stalled over a lack of layoff protections for newer workers, offshore call centers, pension freezes, and a new policy that could require employees to work away far from home for as long as two months without seeing their families. Verizon’s last agreement with its workers expired in August 2015.###',\n",

The 4-4 ruling upholds the lower court’s decision and allows the 1976 Abood v.

This deal, which encompasses 40 percent of the global economy, will send more American jobs overseas and lower wages. Our workers will now have to directly compete with workers making pocket change in countries like Vietnam. We should not be surprised that a trade deal negotiated in secret by 600 corporate advisors gives huge sweetheart deals to multinational corporations while producing disastrous results for the middle class.\"Not only would this deal ship jobs overseas, destroying our communities and local economies in the process, but the deal will also have a widespread effect on issues ranging from drug prices to environmental protections to food safety. It will also almost double the number of corporations with access to special non-judicial courts to challenge state and local laws. In the end the TPP was worse than we thought it would be.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) introduced legislation today that would make it easier for workers to join unions and bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions.\\n      Image    \"The Workplace Democracy Act strengthens the middle class by restoring workers\\' rights to bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions,\" said Rep. Pocan. \"One of the root causes of declining wages is that workers\\' ability to join together and bargain for higher wages and better working conditions has been has been severely undermined. This bill would make it easier for workers to have a voice in the workplace, providing a bigger paycheck to middle class families trying to pay the mortgage and find a way to send their kids to college.\"\"Millions of Americans who want to join unions are unable to do so because of the coercive and often illegal behavior of their employers,\" Sen. Sanders said. \"The benefits of joining a union are clear: higher wages, better benefits and a more secure retirement. If we are serious about reducing income and wealth inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we have got to substantially increase the number of union jobs in this country.\"The Workplace Democracy Act will make it easier for workers to join a union by allowing the National Labor Relations Board to certify a union if a simple majority of eligible workers sign valid authorization cards. The bill also requires companies to begin negotiating within 10 days after certification. If no first contract is reached after 90 days, either party can request compulsory mediation. After 30 days of mediation, the parties will submit the remaining issues to binding arbitration.Joining Sanders and Pocan at the news conference outside the Capitol were workers who have faced retaliation for trying to organize their fellow workers. \"Working moms shouldn\\'t have to strike and face threats just to join a union,\" said Kellie Duckett, a federal contract worker at the U.S. Capitol. \"We should be able sign up for the union just like we sign up for the PTA.\"\"I\\'m here to say that current labor laws don\\'t protect workers,\" Mayra Tito, a federal contract worker, added. \"I should know – I was fired from the Pentagon Starbucks after I went on strike for $15 and a union. That\\'s why we need the Workplace Democracy Act.\" \"I was fired for speaking out in my workplace to improve patient care conditions by organizing a union,\" Allysha Almad, a registered nurse from Pasadena, said. \"My case is not unique. There are thousands of nurses and other workers who face retaliation when they try to raise their voices collectively to address unsafe condition – conditions that in hospitals and other workplaces actually endanger lives.\" According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released earlier this year, union workers\\' wages are 27 percent greater than for non-union workers. Seventy-nine percent of unionized workers receive health insurance from their employers, compared to only 49 percent of non-union workers. Seventy-six percent of union workers have guaranteed defined-benefit pension plans, compared to only 16 percent of non-union workers. Eighty-three percent of union workers receive paid with sick leave compared to only 62 percent of non-union workers.The bill is cosponsored in the House by Reps. Rosa DeLauro, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Cheri Bustos, John Conyers, Matt Cartwright, Marcy Kaptur, Robert C. \"Bobby\" Scott, Mark Takano, Don Norcross, Charlie Rangel, Raul Grijalva, Judy Chu, Marcia Fudge, Janice Hahn and in the Senate by Sens.

This negotiating process has not been transparent, despite claims from the USTR. The secretive nature of these negotiations is compounded by the pressure to throw together this deal based on the political timelines of negotiating partners is worrisome. These negotiations, which have been conducted almost entirely in secret, are even more concerning given our apparent adherence to political timelines with little regard to the interests of U.S. workers.\"Reports throughout the course of the negotiating process raise serious questions about the impact of this agreement on a number of areas, ranging from workplace and environmental protections to food safety. Initial reports indicate that labor standards remain subpar, currency manipulation has not been adequately addressed, rules of origin for autos have been weakened and human rights issues in countries like Malaysia and Brunei have not been dealt with properly. Along with these concerns, corporations still have the ability to supersede the laws of our country through the Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) process.\"Past trade deals have been a disaster for American workers, so it is imperative Congress rigorously reviews this deal to ensure the American people are not being taken for a ride yet again.\"',\n",

       "  'date': 'June 11, 2015',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C – Today, 15 House Democrats led by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman urging the public release of the Labor Advisory Committee (LAC) report pertaining to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).  The Labor Advisory Committee is an official body tasked with advising the United States Trade Representative (USTR) on labor provisions in trade negotiations. Last fall, LAC members compiled a report outlining specific criticisms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership text and detailing how their recommendations were not included in the agreement. Until recently, the document was inaccessible to Members of Congress; the general public and most Congressional staff still do not have access to the full report. Unfortunately, the USTR has classified key parts of the report.As Congress considers granting fast-track authority for this trade agreement, it is imperative the public has access to the entirety of the information in the LAC interim report. The consideration of any trade deal, and especially one as far-reaching as the TPP, requires a transparent discussion about the strength of labor standards and their impact on workers.Full text of the letter is below.Dear Ambassador Froman:We write to urge you to publicly release several documents from the Labor Advisory Committee on Trade Negotiations and Trade Policy (LAC), dealing with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), including any documents received from the LAC or any its members dated April 13, 2015 (whether in modified or unmodified form), any correspondence from LAC members dated September 3, 2014, and any related annexes.While Congress considers Fast Track Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), the TPP agreement being negotiated is the largest free trade agreement in history, covering 40 percent of world GDP.  With the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) being simultaneously negotiated, that total rises to 60 percent. That makes it all the more important that trade agreements be done right.  With such huge implications for the TPP, we feel it is necessary for both Congress and the public to have the opportunity to adequately review concerns and issues raised in the LAC documents.  This will help better inform us as we consider TPA and its application to TPP. While we understand these materials may be made available to Members of Congress, they would not be available to staff without security clearance, and even those staff would further be restricted from viewing it if not in the presence of their Member.  In many instances in the House of Representatives, Members rely on the expert advice of their designated trade staff—who more often than not do not have that clearance.  This significantly hampers the ability of Members of Congress to properly and thoroughly analyze important trade documents.We understand that multilateral negotiations must at times maintain a balance, but also believe the advice provided by the LAC in the requested documents would offer us important insights as to how TPP could affect millions of middle class Americans.Failure to make this information available publicly prior to a vote on TPA, as was done in the Senate, despite 21 senators requesting it, would interfere with Congress\\'s ability to properly exercise its obligations to oversee foreign commerce.Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.Sincerely,___________________________                              ___________________________Mark Pocan                                                                 John ConyersMember of Congress                                                   Member of Congress___________________________                              ___________________________Peter A.

Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement after the House Rules Committee rejected his amendment, which would have prevented \"Fast Track\" authority from being used to pass trade deals which include Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS). ISDS provisions give foreign corporations a special right to sue a government when a law they deem could affect their business, such as protecting the environment or public health, hurts a firm\\'s current or expected profits. \"Across party lines, people have a problem with America giving up their sovereignty and I am disappointed the Rules Committee has rejected my amendment aimed at safeguarding our sovereignty and rule of law.\"ISDS provisions allow multinational corporations to put investor protections and corporate profits ahead of the health and safety of the American people. Multinational corporations have gone to great lengths to ensure special ISDS provisions are included in the TPP because these rules are weighted so favorably towards them no matter what consumer or environmental protection stands in their way. \"Ultimately ISDS provisions are just another reason why giving unilateral ‘Fast Track\\' authority, which would apply to any trade deal for the next 6 years, is such a bad idea. It\\'s time we give up the failed trade policies of the past and adopt a new 21st century trade framework which will grow American jobs and protect U.S. consumers.\" United States Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) introduced the same amendment in the Senate version of the \"Fast Track\" authority bill. In February, Rep.

Gwen Moore (WI-04) and Ron Kind (WI-03), urging Governor Walker to apply for a Preschool Development Expansion Grant. Unfortunately, Governor Scott Walker failed to submit an application before Wednesday\\'s deadline depriving Wisconsin of up to $60 million for preschool programs. Since taking office in 2010, Governor Walker has turned down or ignored federal grant opportunities to expand Medicaid for 87,000 Wisconsinites, to expand high speed internet service for schools, to build a high speed rail system between Madison and Milwaukee, and refused to increase the amount of heating assistance given to people in poverty resulting in cuts to Federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. \"I\\'m very disappointed Scott Walker has put Tea Party politics ahead of doing his job as Governor,\" Rep. Pocan said. \"Playing political games with these federal grant opportunities, while neglecting our infrastructure, ignoring our most vulnerable citizens and running up a projected $1.9 billion deficit is inexcusable. Too many people from Wisconsin are being left behind as Walker prioritizes his higher ambitions.\"Gov. Walker has failed to take advantage of the following federal grant opportunities: Preschool Development Expansion GrantWisconsin was one of 36 states invited to apply for a share of $250 million in grants directed to help states develop and expand high-quality preschool programs for children from low- and moderate-income levels. Governor Walker missed the deadline of October 15 to apply for this grant. The Preschool Development Expansion Grant will award selected states with up to 15 million dollars a year for a period of 4 years.Medicaid ExpansionIn February of 2013, Walker turned down federal money to expand Medicaid in the state of Wisconsin. The expansion would apply to those who earn up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or $15,282.Broadband ExpansionWalker returned $23 million to the federal government in 2011. This money could have been used to expand high-speed internet service in schools, libraries, and government agencies.High-speed Rail ProjectIn 2010, governor-elect Walker turned away $810 million in federal stimulus money aimed at creating a high-speed train system between Milwaukee and Madison. It\\'s estimated that ending the project cost the state as many as 13,719 jobs.Food-stamp IncreaseRecently, Wisconsin ended a program that allowed residents access to increased food assistance paid for by the federal government through \"heat-and-eat\" programs. As a result of the states\\' decision not to increase the amount of heating assistance given to people in poverty, Wisconsin will see cuts in federal Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program (SNAP, or food stamps) benefits.###',\n",

Despite affidavits from workers across Wisconsin demonstrating it is impossible to live on one job that pays Wisconsin\\'s $7.25 an hour minimum wage, the DWD \"found no reasonable cause to believe that the wages paid to the complainants are not a living wage.\"The current minimum wage of $7.25 pays only $14,500 per year. A majority of minimum wage workers are women and the average worker who would get this raise is 35 years old. In 1968, the minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, was the equivalent of $10.74, more than $3 above today\\'s minimum wage of $7.25.

Moore (WI-04) wrote Governor Scott Walker to request details about his proposal to require mandatory drug testing for recipients of FoodShare and Unemployment Insurance. The signed letter is available here.\"It is time Governor Scott Walker stop blaming the poor for being poor,\" Rep. Pocan said. \"Before coming up with new, costly, and ineffective policies, Governor Walker needs to first explain to Wisconsin taxpayers how he intends to address next year\\'s projected $1.9 billion deficit.\"\"Drug testing as a condition of eligibility for critical, life-saving social services is a gross insult to Wisconsin\\'s struggling families,\" Rep. Moore said. \"The insinuation that those battling poverty are somehow more susceptible to substance abuse is as absurd as it is offensive. Governor Walker needs to focus less on finding ways to discriminate against Wisconsin\\'s most vulnerable and focus more on fixing his failed policies that contributed to our state\\'s current economic trouble.\"According to Hunger Task Force, states that have adopted drug testing policies have consistently demonstrated that they are invasive, costly, and constitutionally unsound.In 2011, Florida passed a similar drug testing requirement, which courts eventually ruled was unconstitutional.Florida Governor Rick Scott implemented drug testing for all recipients of federal benefits and state workers. The law required applicants to pay for the test and allowed denial of benefits to anyone who refused testing. From July-September 2011, only 9 failures were recorded, while 565 individuals were declined benefits due to refusal. Given that these are low-income individuals, denying benefits to those who refuse to participate assumes those individuals are drug users when in fact they may simply be unable to afford the test. By 2014, courts have repeatedly deemed the process unconstitutional, yet Florida spent nearly $400,000 defending the program in court. Only 2.6 percent of recipients in Florida tested positive for narcotics – below the national average – and the program cost more tax dollars to implement than it saved in denying benefits. ###',\n",

Everyone benefits when our middle class thrives.\"\"In today\\'s dynamic, global economy, there are more pathways to success than ever before. By strengthening apprenticeship programs, this critical legislation will enable young people nationwide to access these new opportunities,\" said Representative George Miller. \"The PACE Act will not only help young Americans find steady employment now, it will also prepare them for the jobs of tomorrow.\"\"The PACE Act will help workers and businesses by investing in apprenticeships and increasing the number of skilled workers in growing sectors, which is absolutely critical if we hope to keep our competitive edge in the 21st century global economy.\" said Senator Patty Murray. \"This bill will build on recent laws, like the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, to increase the number of highly skilled workers in various sectors of our economy. Workers in Washington state and across the country have benefitted from registered apprenticeship programs. These are investments we know have among the highest pay offs for our economy, and I am proud to stand with Rep. Miller, Rep. Pocan, and a strong coalition of businesses, workers, and educators to introduce this bill and keep this important work going.\"\"PACE would for the first time provide a legislative foundation, and increased funding, for the Office of Apprenticeship, while also providing the Secretary of Labor more systematic advice on apprenticeship regulatory matters from key stakeholders in the system.\" said Sean McGarvey President of North America\\'s Building Trades Unions. \"Perhaps most importantly, PACE would provide increased capacity to administer the National Apprenticeship Act at a time when much is expected in terms of high performance skilled workforce development in the American economy.  PACE, if enacted, would help to correct this imbalance between mission and capacity.\"\"We believe that this is a strong effort to address the nation\\'s skills gap and build a workforce that can compete and succeed in a global economy,\" said Eric Spiegel, CEO, Siemens USA.  \"Business-driven and demand-oriented apprenticeship programs allow for the development of skills to evolve with changes in industry.  We applaud Senator Murray and Congressmen Pocan and Miller for introducing legislation that recognizes that real-world training is a catalyst to ensuring that individuals have the skills needed for the jobs of today and the future.\"The PACE Act builds on the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act – which, ushered by Murray and Miller, passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan, bicameral support, and was signed into law by President Obama – to help workers attain skills for jobs in the 21st Century economy.Read the full legislative text of the PACE Act here.The PACE Act is supported by a variety of business, labor, education, and advocacy groups, including: Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD), International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), Siemens, American Association of Community Colleges (AACC), Association of Community College Trustees (ACCT),  SEIU Healthcare Northwest Training Partnership, Rebuilding America\\'s Middle Class (RAMC), Jobs for the Future (JFF), Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), AFL-CIO, SEIU, Association for Career and Technical Education (ACTE) and the Aspen Institute. Promoting Apprenticeships for Credentials and Employment Act (PACE Act)A highly skilled workforce is necessary to compete in the global economy, support economic growth, and maintain the standard of living of the United States.  According to the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, by 2018 the United States will face a shortage of workers with recognized postsecondary credentials – shortages of 3,000,000 workers with degrees and 4,700,000 workers with certificates.The registered apprenticeship program model is a longstanding, on-the-job training and education model that prepares workers for the skill demands of particular occupations and employers while, at the same time, providing the workers with recognized, portable credentials, and wages while in training.Apprenticeships have been successful in skilled trade industries, including construction and manufacturing, as well as service industries, such as health care, and holds great potential for expansion into other industries.A 2012 evaluation of registered apprenticeship programs by Mathematica Policy Research found that—the tax return on every Federal Government dollar invested in registered apprenticeship programs was $27;individuals who completed registered apprenticeship programs earned over $240,000 more over their careers than individuals not participating in such programs; andthe estimated social benefits of registered apprenticeship programs exceeded their costs by more than $49,000.And an evaluation in Washington State found that for each individual who completes a registered apprenticeship program, over the individual\\'s career, there is a 90-to-1 return on investment, for a total net benefit of just over $300,000 for that career.  Washington State also found that the general public receives a lifetime return on investment of 23-to-1, or around $80,000, for each person completing a registered apprenticeship program.The PACE Act will:increase the number of highly skilled workers in in-demand industry sectors and occupations;increase the attainment of recognized postsecondary credentials by participants;increase awareness about the value of the registered apprenticeship program model as an effective earn-and-learn model for students, workers, and employers;support the development of registered apprenticeship programs with employers, joint labor management partnerships, and other program sponsors;support the development and expansion of pre-apprenticeship programs that lead to success in a registered apprenticeship program; andsupport a closer alignment between registered apprenticeship programs, the workforce development system, and postsecondary education, and will promote the awarding of academic credit for the education and training aspects of apprenticeships.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'Image    Madison, WI—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today joined representatives from a coalition of building trades unions and highway industry associations at a press conference near the Verona Road construction project to call on Congress to save the federal Highway Trust Fund.\"We\\'re gathering here today because we are worried that Congress will not act in time. If Congress does not act by the end of August, the Highway Trust Fund will run dry,\" warned Rep. Mark Pocan. \"This would impact nearly 700,000 jobs across the country next year. Today, there are more than 100,000 active projects across the country, just like the one here at Verona Road. If Congress does not act soon, states like Wisconsin may have to choose which projects going on across the state continue and which ones will have to be delayed because of insufficient funds.\"States initially fund highway construction projects and then get reimbursed for the costs through the Highway Trust Fund. The question now is whether states will be paid back in a timely manner. Without the vital funding from the Highway Trust Fund, projects across Wisconsin could be left without the necessary resources to complete construction on schedule. If financial support from the Highway Trust Fund lapses, the cost of restarting delayed projects could balloon the costs and further jeopardize future construction. It could also lead to job losses in the region and prolong delays for commuters.\"Hundreds of thousands of workers across the country and many right here in south central Wisconsin are counting on Congress to do its job so we can keep doing ours,\" said Dave Branson, Executive Director of the Building and Construction Trades Council of South Central Wisconsin. \"Our members live in the local community and take pride in the work that they do.  They want to be sure the job can get done so their families can drive on new and safe roads.  They want to complete job without fear that the money may dry up and they could be out of a job.\"The Highway Trust Fund is \"user-supported\" through a federal gas tax. The HTF shortfall stems from the fact that the gas tax hasn\\'t been raised since 1993.  All while the country\\'s population has grown substantially and cars have become more fuel-efficient. Reduced financial support and the growing cost of surface transportation construction projects have resulted in the financial crisis the fund is facing today.\"Local businesses and communities rely on our roads and highways,\" said Jim Hoffman, President of Hoffman Construction Company. \"Without the guarantee funds that will be available, some states have decided to put projects on hold, because they don\\'t want to risk unfinished projects left without funding. Stopping the crisis facing the Highway Trust Fund will require Congress to take action before the end of August. We\\'re all counting on them to do the right thing.\"###',\n",

The United States is committed to protecting the rights of religious minorities, LGBT individuals and women across the globe. Moreover, time and again, the United States has spoken out against anti-LGBT activity and discriminatory laws in countries like Nigeria and Uganda and against unequal protection of women, in countries such as Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, and against the persecution of religious minorities in the Central African Republic, China, and Pakistan.Brunei's adoption of the revised penal code legalizes violence against its citizens, constituting torture or other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment. The United States must make it clear that we will not tolerate such abuses. International trade partners have much to gain from an economic relationship with the United States, and our trade agreements should insist that participating countries adhere to internationally recognized civil, political, and human rights standards. Targeting LGBT individuals or religious minorities and opening the door for discrimination and violence against women is a threat we cannot overlook, and should trade agreements like the TPP go into effect with the participation of human rights violators, the United States would lose its leverage to provide economic pressure on countries to reverse unacceptable policies.As the world's largest economy, the United States holds a significant place in world affairs and must use this position to address human rights atrocities in countries like Brunei. According with all applicable rules and regulations, we urge you to insist that Brunei address these human rights violations as a condition before the United States enter into any trade negotiations.###\",\n",

Raising the minimum wage would benefit 28 million Americans immediately and lift millions out of poverty.  This would help stimulate the economy immediately by making sure people have money in their pockets and that money is put back into the economy immediately.” Representative Pocan’s amendment would increase the minimum wage over three years from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour, indexes future annual increases to inflation thereafter, and gradually increases the tipped minimum wage to 70 percent of the minimum wage. The current minimum wage pays only $15,080 per year. Raising the minimum wage is critical to help lift those working hard to support their families out of poverty.  A majority of minimum wage workers are women and the average worker who would get this raise is 35 years old.“The myth of a minimum wage worker is a teenager living with their parents while working part-time after school,” Representative Pocan continued.  “In fact, the minimum wage worker is a very real person in all of our districts who has had a stagnant wage while the rest of the economy has prospered.

Mark Pocan (WI-02) took action today to force an up-or-down vote on legislation which would give 24.5 million Americans, including more than 500,000 Wisconsinites, a pay raise and lift approximately 900,000 people out of poverty. Pocan joined his colleagues in signing a discharge petition to bring up the Fair Minimum Wage Act (H.R. 1010). The bill increases the minimum wage over three years from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour, indexes future annual increases to inflation thereafter, and gradually increases the tipped minimum wage to 70 percent of the minimum wage.“The minimum wage is woefully inadequate to help keep hard-working people out of poverty,” Pocan said. “When millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules cannot support themselves or their families, when they live in poverty, we face an economic crisis. That’s why we must raise the minimum wage, which would give 24.5 million Americans and more than 500,000 hard-working Wisconsinites a pay raise and generate $500 million in increased economic activity in our state alone.”The current minimum wage of $7.25 pays only $14,500 per year, so this increase would lift approximately 900,000 Americans out of poverty. This is critical to those working hard to support their families.  A majority of minimum wage workers are women and the average worker who would get this raise is 35 years old. In 1968, the minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, was the equivalent of $10.74.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.— U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) issued the following statement regarding today’s new analysis from Ways and Means Committee Democrats that projects the Wisconsin economy will lose more than $51 million, and cost the U.S. economy $3 billion, in January and February alone due to the Dec. 28 expiration of federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation.  More than 1.8 million Americans, including more than 31,000 Wisconsinites, have now been cut off extended unemployment insurance because Republicans continue to block an extension of the program.“Refusing to extend long-term unemployment benefits not only threatens the livelihoods of thousands of Wisconsinites, but has cost our state economy more than $51 million in the last two months alone,” Pocan said. “There are few programs that more immediately stimulate the economy than unemployment insurance because these benefits are almost always put right back into the economy to pay for basic necessities, such as food or fuel. Republicans will continue to inflict serious damage to our economy if they do not join with Democrats and renew this vital, economic lifeline.”Pocan, who had pressed Speaker Boehner to address this issue in December, is a sponsor of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act, which would extend the emergency unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed for an additional year.Adding salt to the wound, failure to extend federal unemployment insurance would also hurt job growth throughout the nation, costing the economy 310,000 jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute, while decreasing GDP and increasing government spending for other safety net programs. The White House Council of Economic Advisors estimates that in Wisconsin alone, failing to extend the program will cost more than 5,000 jobs.###',\n",

Mr. Krueger, a steamfitter who was laid off from his job this past June, lost his unemployment insurance on December 28th because Congress failed to take action to extend this vital lifeline. Earlier this month, Pocan joined with Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47) to encourage their colleagues to invite a constituent who has lost unemployment benefits to the President’s speech.Brian is one of more than 30,000 Wisconsinites, and 1.6 million Americans, who have lost their unemployment benefits since December 28th.“I am honored to bring Brian Krueger as my guest to the State of the Union,” Pocan said. “Even though more than 1.6 million Americans, including over 30,000 Wisconsinites, have already lost their unemployment benefits while Congress stands on the sidelines, numbers alone do not tell the full story of the devastating consequences of our inaction.  Brian and his family know firsthand the challenges millions of out-of-work Americans face to support their families while tirelessly looking for a job. I am hopeful that Brian’s story, and the stories of millions of jobless Americans from across the country, will finally spur Congress to move past politics and instead represent our constituents who are struggling just to get by.”“I thank Congressman Pocan for inviting me to the State of the Union, and for his continued fight to help families like my own who have lost unemployment insurance,” Krueger said. “I’m working to get a job each and every day, and I know that my family is just one of thousands in Wisconsin dealing with these same issues. We need Congress to take action.”Brian is a steamfitter who lives in Mount Horeb with his wife Bridget and two children in high school. After working for General Heating and Cooling for 10 years, he was first laid off for a year starting in November of 2010.  Beginning in August of 2011, he started a two-year job building the new campus power plant.  After that job was completed in June of 2013, he was laid off again. Since that time, Brian has been applying for two to three positions a day.  He’s also applied for temporary and part-time positions.  He is also taking OSHA safety classes to make himself more marketable. Brian would have been eligible for federal benefits at the end of December had they not expired.  The Kruegers have applied for food stamps and the reduced lunch program for their two children, and are working with their mortgage company to keep up with their  mortgage payments.Brian’s wife initially contacted Pocan’s office in mid-January to explain their story and urge Congress to take action to extend emergency unemployment benefits.',\n",

Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Alan Lowenthal (D-CA) today encouraged their colleagues to join with them and invite a constituent who has lost unemployment benefits to the State of the Union on January 28, 2014.

Without Congressional action, millions of Americans are at risk of falling into poverty, and according to the Congressional Budget Office, our economy could lose approximately 200,000 jobs this year. Statistics and facts on their own though do not tell the full story, nor do they put a face on this important issue.  The President’s annual State of the Union Address, which this year will take place on Tuesday, January 28, 2014, is an opportunity for us to put a face on this issue, and for us all to gain a greater understanding of the effect unemployment insurance has on the people we represent. We thus encourage you to invite as your special guest for the State of the Union Address a constituent from your district who has recently lost his or her unemployment insurance, or is in danger of losing these benefits, due to Congressional inaction.After a year filled with far too much partisan acrimony, Americans are looking for Congress to show that we can work together on the issues important to them.

If implemented, Congress would vote to accept or reject a trade agreement, but would be unable to amend the text.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—As the United States continues to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a massive new trade deal with 11 other countries that would affect nearly every sector of the American economy, Congress and the American people continue to be left in the dark on the contents of the deal. In response, today U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) joined more than 150 of his Democratic colleagues in a letter to President Obama opposing the use of the “Fast Track” process or any mechanism that would rush the deal through Congress without proper oversight and input.  The letter is led by Representatives Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) and George Miller (D-CA).“Wisconsinites have seen these type of “free trade” deals rushed through Washington before, and we saw the results firsthand: closed factories, depleted industries and lost jobs,” Pocan said. “We cannot make the same mistakes of the past. If the administration wants to get the approval of Congress for this new agreement, we must take the time to conduct the careful and thorough oversight this measure requires.”The Constitution provides Congress with the authority to oversee all international trade agreements, but previously Congress has instituted a procedure called “fast track negotiating authority” or “trade promotion authority” which speeds up the trade agreement approval process by delegating wide swaths of Congress’s power to oversee international trade to the executive branch. If implemented, Congress would vote to accept or reject a trade agreement, but would be unable to amend the text. Members of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committees are looking to develop legislation that would reinstate the outdated Fast Track procedures that expired in 2007.“Twentieth Century ‘Fast Track’ is simply not appropriate for 21st Century agreements and must be replaced,” the members wrote. “A new trade agreement negotiation and approval process that restores a robust role for Congress is essential to achieving U.S. trade agreements that can secure prosperity for the greatest number of Americans, while preserving the vital tenets of American democracy in the era of globalization.”As a small business owner who has seen the effects of massive trade deals and their impact on American products, Pocan has been a leader in fighting for fair trade deals that protect American jobs and American industries. This summer, Pocan led a letter with 35 other freshman lawmakers calling for increased transparency from the administration on TPP and urging Congress not to give up its constitutional authority to oversee foreign trade agreements.The full text of the letter is below:Dear President Obama:We write to express our serious concern with the ongoing negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Free Trade Agreement (FTA), a potential agreement of tremendous consequence for our country. Specifically, we remain deeply troubled by the continued lack of adequate congressional consultation in many areas of the proposed pact that deeply implicates Congress’ constitutional and domestic policy authorities.For some time, members of Congress have urged your administration to engage in broader and deeper consultations with members of the full range of committees of Congress whose jurisdiction touches on the numerous issues being negotiated.  Many have raised concerns relating to reports about the agreement’s proposed content.  While your Administration’s goal was to sign a TPP FTA at the October 2013 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, we believe that to date the process has failed to provide adequate consultation with Congress.Such opportunity for input from Congress is critical as the TPP FTA will include binding obligations that touch upon a wide swath of policy matters under the authority of Congress. Beyond traditional tariff issues, these include policies related to labor, patent and copyright, land use, food, agriculture and product standards, natural resources, the environment, professional licensing, competition, state-owned enterprises and government procurement policies, as well as financial, healthcare, energy, e-commerce, telecommunications and other service sector regulations.  In light of the broad scope of today’s trade agreements, it is even more vital that Congress have a fulsome role in shaping these pacts’ terms. Given our concerns, we will oppose  “Fast Track” Trade Promotion Authority or any other mechanism delegating Congress’ constitutional authority over trade policy that continues to exclude us from having a meaningful role in the formative stages of trade agreements and throughout negotiating and approval processes.Congress, not the Executive Branch, must determine when an agreement meets the objectives Congress sets in the exercise of its Article I-8 exclusive constitutional authority to set the terms of trade.   For instance, an agreement that does not specifically meet congressional negotiating objectives must not receive preferential consideration in Congress.  A new trade agreement negotiation and approval process that restores a robust role for Congress is essential to achieving U.S. trade agreements that can secure prosperity for the greatest number of Americans, while preserving the vital tenets of American democracy in the era of globalization.Twentieth Century “Fast Track” is simply not appropriate for 21st Century agreements and must be replaced.  The United States cannot afford another trade agreement that replicates the mistakes of the past. We can and must do better.We are deeply committed to transforming U.S. trade policy into a tool for creating and retaining family-wage jobs in America, safeguarding the environment, maintaining consumer protection and improving the quality of life throughout the country.   We look forward to working with you to ensure that Congress and the Executive Branch are working together to meet that critical goal.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON—As the United States announced today it expects to complete work on a major new foreign trade agreement by the end of the year, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan today expressed continued concerns with the deal and encouraged Congress not to “fast track” the agreement for approval. Pocan recently reviewed sections of the bracketed draft text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade agreement currently being negotiated between the United States and 11 other countries in the Pacific region, and believes the current language would put Wisconsin workers, jobs and local businesses at a disadvantage and ship American jobs overseas.This summer, Pocan led a letter with 35 other freshman lawmakers calling for increased transparency from the administration on TPP and urging Congress not to give up its constitutional authority to oversee foreign trade agreements.“In Wisconsin we’ve already suffered through the effects of massive trade deals that shipped our jobs overseas and took “Made in America” products off our shelves. Unfortunately, this new trade agreement appears to be no better than deals of the past, and from what I can tell, may even be worse,” said Pocan. “Beyond putting Wisconsin workers and local businesses at a disadvantage, the agreement as it stands now would likely do nothing to prevent the grave labor and environmental abuses currently perpetuated by many of our trade “friends.”  While administration officials may be determined to complete negotiations by the end of the year, Congress is obligated not to rush its Constitutional-oversight without addressing provisions that could have lasting consequences for our economy.”The Constitution provides Congress with the authority to oversee all international trade agreements. But if recent precedent is followed, the TPP would likely reach the House floor with limited opportunities for Congress to offer input, and without the ability for Congress to amend the text.After Pocan reviewed specific sections of the agreement focused on procurement and labor, he had particular concerns regarding:The protection of Buy American and other procurement policiesThe ability to prevent harmful labor practices abroadThe enforcement of environmental protectionsHow participating nations could address humanitarian concernsThe determination of how jurisdictions, both in the U.S. and abroad, would be subject to the agreement“Some of the countries that are currently negotiating the TPP with the United States have atrocious labor practices,” Pocan said. “In order to bring these nations into the agreement, we will likely have to lower our standards, not raise them, and make it even harder to keep jobs in our country.”As a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Pocan led the passage of the American Jobs Act, which required all state contracts be performed in the United States.###',\n",

       "  'title': 'Pocan Calls on Sen. McConnell to Stop Denying Justice to Workers',\n",
       "  'date': 'July 9, 2013',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON—In another transparent attempt to weaken the National  Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and deny 80 million private sector workers, both union and non-union, the protection they are guaranteed under law, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is refusing to allow votes on President Obama’s nominees to the Board. Without a fully-functioning NLRB, hardworking Americans will have no recourse when their rights are violated, creating uncertainty for both workers and businesses.  In response, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) has joined more than 200 of his colleagues in a letter to McConnell, urging him to stop the obstructionist tactics and allow the Senate to vote on the president’s NLRB nominees.“The Republican attacks on the NLRB prevent the agency from performing its duties and leave workers and employers without the protections they need and deserve,” Pocan said. “As employees continue to wait for their cases to be addressed and for justice to be served, their livelihoods and their ability to provide for their families remain at risk. Senator McConnell needs to stop his partisan obstructionism and backdoor attacks to rewrite our nation’s labor laws and allow a vote on the President’s NLRB nominees without delay.” Earlier this year, President Obama nominated five individuals to the Board, all of whom continue to wait for votes by the full Senate. If the Senate does not act, come August 27th the five-member NLRB will only have two sitting members, one short of the legal minimum needed to conduct its work. This would be a disaster for workers and employers all across the country, as there would be no federal agency left to enforce labor laws for private-sector employers. Already, because of a recent decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that brought into question the ability of President Obama to make recess appointments to the Board, businesses are challenging NLRB decisions in unprecedented numbers—already there have been 600 challenges to Board decisions involving Obama’s recess appointees, Ms. Sharon Block and Mr. Richard Griffin. McConnell has stated that he will not allow votes on NLRB nominees unless Ms. Block and Mr. Griffin are replaced.“Demanding the resignation of Ms. Block and Mr. Griffin is counterproductive and ignores both legal process and precedent,” the members wrote to McConnell. “Each day that the Board sits idle is one in which workers’ lawful rights are put at risk.  We urge you to withdraw this partisan demand and allow the Senate to fulfill its constitutional responsibility to consider presidential appointments, and to do so without continued delay.”The full text of the letter is below:July 9, 2013Senator Mitch McConnell317 Russell Senate Office BuildingWashington, DC 20510                                                                                             Dear Senator McConnell:We are writing to express our serious concern over recent press reports detailing your position regarding the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Specifically, your office stated that the Senate will not vote on the full package of Board nominees unless current Board members Ms. Sharon Block and Mr. Richard Griffin are replaced. This is nothing more than a blatant and cynical attempt to shut down the NLRB’s lawful ability to investigate and remedy unfair labor practices.As you are well aware, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (DC Circuit), Noel Canning v. NLRB, decision to invalidate the President Obama’s recess appointments of Ms. Block and Mr. Griffin is not the final legal say on the matter. Therefore, their current nominations should not be disqualified. The President has asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and there is pending litigation in at least five other district courts. Demanding the resignation of Ms. Block and Mr. Griffin is counterproductive and ignores both legal process and precedent.At the moment, only three members are sitting on the NLRB, with one member’s term due to expire in August.  As a result, the Board is at risk of being unable to function.  Furthermore, employers are already using the Noel Canning decision to challenge the NLRB’s decisions and the DC Circuit Court is putting these cases on hold, leaving workers without remedy when they are illegally fired or when their employer refuses to negotiate in good faith.These delays and the uncertainty that they cause have real world consequences for American workers.  For example, Marcus Hedger from Illinois has lost his family home while waiting for a final decision on his illegal firing.  In September 2012 a unanimous bipartisan panel of the NLRB determined in that Mr. Hedger was terminated as a result of union activity and ordered that he be reinstated with back pay. However, the company appealed that decision to the DC Circuit Court. In January, the case was delayed due to the Noel Canning decision, leaving Mr. Hedger without any remedy. It has been several years since the situation began and he still is struggling for justice.The NLRB provides critical protections to American workers and gives businesses much needed labor certainty.  Each day that the Board sits idle is one in which workers’ lawful rights are put at risk. This continued ideological obstructionism is denying hardworking Americans the crucial worker protections that the NLRB provides. We urge you to withdraw this partisan demand and allow the Senate to fulfill its constitutional responsibility to consider presidential appointments, and to do so without continued delay.###',\n",

       "  'text': \"WASHINGTON – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a small business owner for more than two decades, today honored small businesses across Wisconsin in celebration of the 50th Annual National Small Business Week. National Small Business Week recognizes the immense contributions of the country’s small business owners to the economy and culture of America.“Small businesses are the backbone of our Wisconsin economy, and they are the key to ensuring long-term growth and job creation across the state,” Pocan said. “When we support our small businesses owners, we support our communities, our economy and the entrepreneurial drive of our citizens. But as a small business owner myself, I know firsthand the challenges than entrepreneurs face when trying to build and expand their business in a recovering economy. That’s why in Congress, I’m focused on how we can create an environment where small businesses can grow, hire and thrive. From providing incentives for businesses to create jobs, to reducing burdensome and confusing paperwork, to ending the sequester that cuts $900 million in critical small business loans, we can take proactive steps to empower our small business owners with the tools and certainty they need to get people back to work.”Under the sequester, small business owners are projected to lose access to more than $900 million in loans, and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the sequester will cost 750,000 American jobs this year, including 36,000 jobs in Wisconsin.  Pocan supports replacing the devastating sequester cuts with a balanced agreement that creates jobs, strengthens the middle class and responsibly reduces the deficit.A lifelong advocate for small businesses, Pocan has co-sponsored the following bills to support small businesses and promote economic growth:Make it in America Manufacturing ActCancel the Sequester Act of 2013Workforce Infrastructure for Skilled Employees (WISE) Investment ActJob Skills for America's Students ActInvest in American Jobs ActSmall Business Tax Equity Act\",\n",

We have a responsibility in Congress to take proactive and commonsense measures that can provide our business owners with certainty and promote economic growth. And yet Republican leadership, which can find time to vote for the 37th time to repeal the Affordable Care Act, has scheduled zero votes on any sort of jobs legislation.“With more than 200,000 Wisconsinites, and almost 12 million Americans, still out of work, jobs need to be our number one priority.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (March 8, 2019) – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02) today joined House Democrats in voting to pass H.R. 1, the For the People Act, a sweeping package of pro-democracy and anti-corruption reforms that will put the power back in the hands of the American people by ending the dominance of big money in politics; making it easier, not harder, to vote; and ensuring that politicians actually serve the public interest.Pocan is a Vice-chair of the Democracy Reform Task Force, which introduced the legislation. Several parts of bills Pocan has introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives have been included in H.R. 1, including one that limits the authority of states to remove voters from election rolls based on interstate voter registration cross-checks, as well as one that requires the use of paper ballots on electronic voting machines.Pocan also offered three amendments to the bill that were included in the bill\\'s final passage. The amendments include one that creates a new, single lobbying disclosure portal, one that requires voting machines to be made in America, and one that would end the practice of prison gerrymandering. As Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, he also secured inclusion of a provision that would require disclosure of the President\\'s business tax returns.\"Today, the swamp in Washington took the most direct hit that it has experienced in decades when House Democrats voted to restore power to the American people, clean up the corruption in Washington, and reform our democracy,\" said Pocan. \"With the passage of the For the People Act, House Democrats are making our government more ethical, expanding the right to vote, ensuring transparency by our elected leaders, and ending the out-of-control influence of big money in politics. These are concrete steps that will make a serious difference in our democracy and move us towards a system where government works for the public interest, not the special interests.\"\"As an original cosponsor of the For the People Act, I\\'m grateful that parts of two of my bills, the Voter Roll Integrity Act and Secure America\\'s Future Elections Act, were included in this legislation,\" continued Pocan. \"Ensuring that voter rolls can no longer be erroneously purged of still-eligible voters due to the interstate voter registration cross-check program, a tactic that Republicans across the country have employed to exclude millions of voters, and establishing paper ballot and manual counting requirements for electronic voting to safeguard our elections from foreign interference are critical steps in restoring confidence in election outcomes.\"\"I thank Congressman John Sarbanes for agreeing to include these provisions in H.R. 1. I\\'m also pleased that several amendments I offered were included in the For the People Act, including one that would create a single lobbying disclosure portal to increase transparency, one that would require voting machines to be made in America, and one that would end the practice of prison gerrymandering, which distorts representation at state and local levels,\" said Pocan.\"Majority Leader McConnell should listen to the American people, stop his dishonest attacks on this bill, and bring it up for a vote in the Senate. The fact is: Republicans are against expanding the right to vote, ensuring transparency, and reforming our democracy because they know that a corrupt system is the surest way for them to win. Rather than strengthen the swamp, the GOP should join Democrats in restoring power to the American people and support this legislation,\" concluded Pocan.Pocan previously introduced the Voter Roll Integrity Act (H.R. 3091), which would strengthen voter protections by ensuring that states can no longer erroneously purge voter rolls without the knowledge or consent of active and still-eligible voters through the interstate voter registration cross-check program. He has also introduced the Secure America\\'s Future Elections Act (H.R. 1562), which would address election standards to protect against cyber-threats, better voting machines and provide paper ballots, and mandate random audits of ballots to thwart interference.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, today introduced the Voter Roll Integrity Act, H.R. 3091 which strengthens voter protections by ensuring that states can no longer erroneously purge voter rolls without the knowledge or consent of active and still-eligible voters through a system called Interstate Cross Check.According a 2016 NBC report, an analysis of nearly 50 million registered voters from 12 different states demonstrated that over 7 million people were removed from the voting rolls, potentially without a comprehensive confirmation from the voter in question.  These purges disproportionately impact young people, minorities, and low-income voters.\"Kicking legally-registered voters off the voting rolls stifles democracy and creates an unnecessary burden for voters who find that they have been mistakenly and unfairly removed from the rolls,\" said Rep. Pocan. \"This is a problem affecting more than 7 million people across the country and I\\'ve heard from many of my constituents about this Interstate Cross Check. The Voter Roll Integrity Act will help ensure states cannot infringe upon an individual\\'s right to vote.\"\"Access to the ballot box is critical to a fair and functioning democracy, and Congress must ensure that no state is actively wiping eligible Americans from voter rolls,\" said Lisa Gilbert, Vice President of Legislative Affairs at Public Citizen. \"At a time when politicians rely on huge donors to get and remain in power, our last line of defense against a corporate takeover of our government is the American people. The Voter Roll Integrity Act is an important step towards ensuring that all Americans, particularly young people, people of color, and low-income voters are not blocked by states from raising their voices in our democracy.\"The Voter Roll Integrity Act would require that states:May only remove a voter from the rolls if they have independently confirmed her or his full name, including middle name; date of birth; last 4 digits of social security number; and suffix. Request a response from voters to confirm a change of address',\n",

       "  'title': 'Comprehensive Legislation Would Safeguard Future Elections from Cyber-Attacks',\n",
       "  'date': 'March 16, 2017',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – In light of the widespread Russian interference in the 2016 election, U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI), Keith Ellison (D-MN), and Hank Johnson (D-GA) today introduced the Securing America\\'s Future Elections (SAFE) Act. This comprehensive legislation would safeguard our elections from future foreign cyber-attacks and interference by permanently classifying the integrity and security of our elections as a key component of critical infrastructure. This important classification would place elections systems in the same category as other critical infrastructure including the power grid, the banking system, and other utilities. The SAFE Act also addresses election standards to protect against cyber-threats, better voting machines that provide paper ballots, and random audits of ballots to thwart interference.As we continue to uncover the extent of Russia\\'s aggressive cyber tactics against the 2016 election and potential Russian ties to the Trump Administration, Republicans on the House Administration Committee voted to shut down the Election Administration Committee (EAC), the federal agency created to help states improve their election systems and security. The EAC is the most well-equipped agency to deal with election technology issues, such as software patches, for voting machines from private vendors. Eliminating this crucial agency would create an easily exploitable opportunity to hackers. The SAFE Act would reauthorize the EAC for a period of 10 years and require a random audit of precincts/wards in each state to ensure there are no discrepancies between paper ballots and electronic ballots.\"We must make sure the widespread Russian hacking and interference in the 2016 election never happens again,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"That\\'s why we are introducing this comprehensive approach to secure our election process from start to finish. By making our elections a top national security priority, we can ensure cybersecurity standards for voting systems are upgraded and require paper ballots with all electronic voting machines. One thing Democrats and Republicans should agree on is that we should be doing everything in our power to guarantee the sovereignty of our county and the integrity of our elections. This bill will do just that.\"\"Few things are as critical as the integrity of our elections, which is why we must protect one of our most sacred institutions from foreign powers and domestic hackers who seek to undermine and influence our democratic process,\" said Rep. Keith Ellison. \"The SAFE Act makes our elections a top national security priority, creates cybersecurity standards to protect our voting systems, and ensures accountability to voters. The American people must have full confidence that their votes are protected and counted. Russia nor any other country should be able to interfere in our elections ever again, which is why we must pass the SAFE Act.\"\"Recent reports documenting an alleged data breach at Georgia\\'s Center For Elections Systems – involving as much as 7.5 million voter records – serve as a stark reminder of the vulnerability of our election infrastructure,\" said Rep. Hank Johnson. \"As a fundamental tenet of our democracy, our voting systems are a matter of national security and we must make sure they are not compromised or disrupted by outside parties. Expressing Congress\\' support to designate our voting systems as critical infrastructure will encourage the Department of Homeland Security and the states to better coordinate, engage, and share resources that will improve the security of our electoral process. The SAFE Act will help ensure the security of our voting systems and preserve public faith in the integrity of our electoral process.\"The SAFE Act would: 1. Permanently classify the security and integrity of our elections as essential to the United States\\' national security interests and allow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to designate election infrastructure as critical infrastructure. This includes storage facilities, polling places, vote tabulation locations, voter databases, voting machines, and other systems that manage the election process.  This important classification would place elections systems in the same category as other critical infrastructure including the power grid, the banking system, and other utilities.2. Authorize the necessary funding for upgrading cybersecurity standards of voting systems, including the software used to operate such systems, and to ensure the security of the manufacturing processes for such components through collaboration with the National Institute for Standards in Technology (NIST) and the Department of Homeland Security. The bill will also ensure cybersecurity for all voter registration databases.3. Require NIST and DHS to create basic cybersecurity standards for private companies contracted to work on elections systems in the US.4. Require all electronic voting machines to have a corresponding paper ballot. The EAC would be required to randomly audit 5% of wards/precincts in each state to ensure that there are no discrepancies between paper ballots and electronic ballots.5. Reauthorize the EAC (Election Assistance Commission) for a period of 10 years. The EAC is the most well-equipped agency to deal with election technology issues, such as software patches, for voting machines from private vendors. Eliminating this crucial agency would create an easily exploitable opportunity to hackers. 6. Require the DHS to conduct a review of elections systems yearly beginning in 2018.',\n",

       "  'date': 'February 16, 2017',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.  – Today, U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Keith Ellison (D-MN), along with Rep. John Lewis  (D-GA) and 24 original cosponsors introduced a resolution, which would explicitly guarantee the right to vote. At a time when voting rights across the country have come under unprecedented assault and faith in our election process is being undermined by President Trump, the Pocan-Ellison Right to Vote Amendment would amend the U.S. Constitution to provide all Americans with the affirmative right to vote.While most Americans believe an explicit right to vote is enshrined in our Constitution, the Constitution contains no expressed guarantee of an individual\\'s right to vote. A constitutional amendment can ensure this right is guaranteed while also providing a pathway to challenge attempts to restrict voting rights.\"The biggest strength of our democracy is that all citizens have an equal say through their vote,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"We have seen constant attempts by some states to erode voting rights and make it harder for citizens to vote. Our current President has also spread lies about illegal voting in what clearly looks like an attempt to undermine our election process. This constitutional amendment would help prevent these attempts to erode voting rights and affirm the principle of equal participation in our democracy for every citizen. Our democracy is strongest when everyone is able to participate, and it is time to fulfill that promise to the American people.\"\"Our democracy gains strength when more Americans participate in elections,\" Rep. Keith Ellison said. \"But millions cannot vote today because of restrictive voting laws in some states – and President Trump has pledged to expand those laws nationwide. A constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote would help stop this voter suppression. In 2016, 14 states had new restrictions in place for the first time in a presidential election. The impact this has on civic participation is devastating. Particularly for low-income communities and communities of color. Voting is central to the health of our democracy—every citizen in this country should have an inalienable right to vote.\"\"The vote is the most powerful non-violent tool for change that we have in a democratic society,\" Rep. John Lewis said. \"We need to make it simple and easy for every American citizen, who is of voting age, to weigh in on the matters that govern their lives.  This bill guarantees that eligible citizens cannot be so easily disenfranchised, and the right of each have a say in the democratic process is protected.\"The ongoing assault on voting rights in states across the country underscores the need for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, at least 46 bills to restrict access to registration and voting have been introduced in 21 states as of February 1, 2017, including efforts to require a photo ID, make voter registration more difficult, reduce early voting opportunities, and make it harder for students to vote.This legislation is also cosponsored by Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), Brendan Boyle (D-PA), Matt Cartwright (D-PA), Judy Chu (D-CA), Steven Cohen (D-TN), John Conyers (D-MI), Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA), John Garamendi (D-CA), Raúl M.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC – In response to a formal request from Congresswoman Gwen Moore (D-WI), Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Congressmen Ron Kind (D-WI) and Mark Pocan (D-WI), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced today that its Civil Rights Division plans to deploy resources to Wisconsin for tomorrow’s general election. Congresswoman Moore and Congressman Pocan responded to this announcement with the following statement: “I take great comfort in knowing that personnel from the U.S. Justice Department will be on the ground in Milwaukee during this historic election,” said Congresswoman Moore. “Too many Wisconsinites, especially those in communities of color, face a host of unnecessary obstacles in their efforts exercise their constitutional right to vote. This is simply unacceptable. My colleagues and I in Wisconsin’s Democratic congressional delegation would like to thank the DOJ for ensuring that all voters, regardless of party affiliation or political ideology, have the right to take part in our democracy, free of discrimination or intimidation.”“The decision by the Department of Justice, while welcome, is a bittersweet victory for those of us who want to ensure voting rights are upheld,” said Congressman Pocan. “Although the DOJ’s efforts to enforce federal voting-rights laws is essential to fending off the worst aspects of this relentless attack on the right to vote, my colleagues and I will fight to end the suppression and intimidation that have become normalized in this election. The bedrock of democracy is the robust participation of all of us in the political process—this has always been a core Wisconsin value. We cannot and will not tolerate the continued threat of disenfranchisement against hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites.” In an op-ed published earlier today, Congresswoman Moore and Congressman Pocan outlined their motivation behind the request to the DOJ and underscored how Wisconsin’s voter ID law puts the franchise of many Wisconsinites, particularly people of color, in serious jeopardy.Click here to read Congresswoman Moore and Congressman Pocan’s op-ed in the Huffington Post.Click here to read the full text of the signed letter to the DOJ.',\n",

       "  'text': \"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI), along with Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Reps. Ron Kind (D-WI) and Gwen Moore (D-WI), sent a letter to the Department of Justice requesting assistance in overseeing Wisconsin’s monitoring of the election, including providing poll-monitoring services in the state. The request was spurred by Wisconsin’s contentious and discriminatory Voter ID Law and a political environment that has become increasingly intimidating for voters.“We have continued to see how Wisconsin’s voter ID law puts the franchise of many Wisconsinites, particularly people of color, in real jeopardy,” the Members of Congress write. “Given the flawed efforts thus far by state officials to properly implement this law, with proof of demonstrably false information having been disseminated to voters just days before the election, we fear that irreparable harm may result—particularly to voters of color, who disproportionately bear the brunt of these policies and any Election Day intimidation efforts. We ask the Department to provide any resources or assistance it can in order to help our state navigate these unsettling circumstances.”The full text of the letter is below and a signed copy can be found here.Dear Attorney General Lynch,As you are aware, Wisconsin, which we represent, is among 14 states that have adopted new voter restrictions in advance of the November 8th election. The state’s 2011 voter identification law, one of the strictest in the country, has been repeatedly challenged in federal court due to its discriminatory effects on vulnerable populations’ voting rights.  Due to the law’s contentious nature and poor implementation, coupled with a political environment that is becoming increasingly intimidating, we are requesting the Department of Justice’s assistance in overseeing the state’s monitoring of the election, including by providing poll-monitoring services in Wisconsin. In 2014, a U.S. district court noted that more than 300,000 Wisconsinites lacked the newly requisite form of identification, and that this population disproportionately included persons of color. Judge Lynn Adelman further observed that state officials “could not point to a single instance of known voter impersonation occurring in Wisconsin at any time in the recent past,” casting serious doubt on the official rationale for the policy.A second federal court determined earlier this summer that even the “safety net” built into the law to help voters who have trouble obtaining ID was a “wretched failure” that “disenfranchised citizens” who are “overwhelmingly African American and Latino.”Deeming the provision unconstitutional, Judge James Peterson mandated changes in practice and public education to ensure that that process better serves all Wisconsinites with documentation challenges in obtaining identification so they can vote. Concurring with Judge Adelman, Judge Peterson also expressed “misgivings about whether the law actually promotes confidence and integrity,” and observed that prior to 2011, “Wisconsin had an exemplary election system that produced high levels of voter participation without significant irregularities.”Unfortunately, since that court order in late July, we have continued to see how Wisconsin’s voter ID law puts the franchise of many Wisconsinites, particularly people of color, in real jeopardy. Over the last month, press reports have revealed that on numerous occasions, Wisconsin Department of Motor Vehicle employees provided erroneous and incomplete information to potential voters who are unable to obtain IDs due to a lack of required documentation (like a birth certificate), despite their eligibility for alternative credentials.These revelations led Judge Peterson to remark on October 12, “I'm very disappointed to see that the state really did nothing in response to my order,” noting that voters are “at the mercy of the DMV, and its staff wasn't trained well enough to guide people through it.” We are deeply troubled by the prospect of such misinformation contributing to voter disenfranchisement in this election. While further scrutiny by the federal court has prompted state officials to institute additional training and public education efforts at the DMV, there is entirely too much at stake in the limited time left before the election to let this continue without additional oversight. In addition to misinformation, we are also concerned about potential voter intimidation at the polling places, particularly in light of recent, high-profile rhetoric that alleges “election rigging.” National figures have suggested that there is widespread voter fraud in our country and have encouraged private citizens to monitor the voting behaviors of certain communities for potential misconduct. Given the flawed efforts thus far by state officials to properly implement this law, with proof of demonstrably false information having been disseminated to voters just days before the election, we fear that irreparable harm may result—particularly to voters of color, who disproportionately bear the brunt of these policies and any Election Day intimidation efforts.We ask the Department to provide any resources or assistance it can in order to help our state navigate these unsettling circumstances.  For example, the Department has historically provided poll monitors on Election Day to help ensure that all eligible voters will be permitted to register and exercise their fundamental right to participate in our democracy. We therefore urge the Department of Justice to utilize any available election monitoring resources to ensure voters in Wisconsin are able to safely access the polls. The right to elect our public representatives is unrivaled in its importance to a fully functioning democracy.  With few days remaining until the election, it is imperative that we do everything in our power to limit the amount of harm caused to our state’s voters.Thank you for your consideration of this request and for the Department of Justice’s ongoing efforts to ensure the fairness of all elections in our country. # # #\",\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and U.S. Representatives Ron Kind (D-WI 3), Gwen Moore (D-WI 4) and Mark Pocan (D-WI 2) today called on the U.S. Department of Justice to conduct a review of Wisconsin’s voter identification requirements and consider bringing a legal challenge or join litigation in Wisconsin’s Eastern and Western District Courts. “The barriers these requirements have set up and the harmful impact they have had for many Wisconsin voters demonstrate that now is the time for a full and thorough review of the constitutionality of the voter ID law,” the members of Congress wrote. “These developments raise serious questions about the impact the voter ID law has had on the ability of many Wisconsinites to exercise perhaps their most fundamental constitutional right – the right to vote and participate in our democracy.  As such, we believe it is critical that the Department of Justice carefully review the effect of this law and what steps it can take to help uphold the voting rights of all Wisconsinites.”In a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the Wisconsin Congressional Democrats urge the Justice Department to conduct a review of Wisconsin’s potentially discriminatory voting requirements to determine whether they are consistent with the Voting Rights Act and federal constitutional protections for the right to vote. The members of Congress also call for a review of all the options available to the Department of Justice, including bringing a legal challenge or intervening in existing litigation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has ruled that eligible voters facing difficulty obtaining ID have the right to challenge the law as it applies to them.  This issue is now back before Wisconsin’s Eastern District court.  A separate challenge brought in the state’s Western District is scheduled to go to trial in May. While Wisconsin’s voter ID law has been under the scrutiny of federal courts for several years, the April 5th primary election was the first instance in which the law, one of the nation’s most restrictive, was implemented. This election day, there were numerous press reports of long lines and significant challenges for many voters, particularly students, to comply with the requirements of the new law. Additional press reports highlighted troubling statements by individuals closely connected to the state legislature’s consideration of the law, indicating that its passage may have been motivated, at least in part, by a desire to reduce youth and minority participation in elections.

       "  'date': 'February 9, 2016',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON — Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Keith Ellison (D-MN) sent a letter to PBS urging the moderators of Thursday’s Democratic Debate in Milwaukee to bring up the topic of voting rights.The text of the letter is below and available online here.Dear Public Broadcasting Service:We have had 13 Presidential debates and heard from the candidates on a wide range of issues from White House floral arrangements to presidential eligibility, yet voting rights is glaringly absent from the conversation. In fact, Democratic candidates have only spent about three minutes on the topic over their five debates. We urge PBS to include the topic of voter participation in Thursday’s Democratic Presidential debate in Milwaukee. By failing to have a substantive dialogue about voting rights, debate moderators and candidates are ignoring a disturbing trend. Across the nation, the democratic process is being undermined through voter suppression laws. Thursday’s democratic debate is the time to outline a plan to make it easier to vote.  Since the 2013 Supreme Court decision Shelby County v. Holder, which weakened the Voting Rights Act (VRA), laws limiting voter participation have been enacted in states across the country. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, since the beginning of the 2015 legislative session at least 113 bills have been introduced in 33 states that would require photo ID, reduce early voting, or make voter registration more difficult. For instance, 16 states—including Wisconsin—will have new voter restriction laws in place for this election, which they did not have in 2012.In Wisconsin, the partisan voter ID law places huge burdens on voters around the state. Residents who live in rural counties where the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has limited hours, homeless veterans concentrated in cities like Milwaukee, and students with technical college IDs, who typically come from lower income households face additional hurdles to get the proper ID to vote. In one particular case, a homeless veteran in Milwaukee spent two years making trips to the DMV and Social Security office because his government issued veterans license was not accepted at the polls. It is no coincidence that these laws are designed to deliberately make it harder to for people of color, young people, low-income individuals, and seniors to vote. It is also not surprising why voting rights have not come up in GOP debates. Conservatives help advance their policy agenda by suppressing the vote of folks who care about social security, student debt, universal health care and affordable housing. They look the other way while voters wait in line for hours to vote, or can’t vote because they can’t leave their job while the polls are open.  Given that the 2016 election will be the first presidential contest in 50 years without the full protections of the VRA, it is more important than ever for Democratic candidates to detail their plans to ensure the American people have a voice in the electoral process. Voter restriction laws have consequences. A recent studyat UC-San Diego found that strict ID laws could be expected to depress the Latino vote turnout by 9.3 points, African-American turnout by 8.6 points, and Asian-American turnout by 12.5 points. This dispels the myth that voter ID laws don’t harm participation rates. Additionally, wealthy Americans vote at much higher rates than low income Americans—and our economic policies reflect this. When low income Americans vote in greater numbers, elected officials implement more policies that serve them. We can no longer ignore how low voter participation affects the future of our country.Grassroots organizers across the country are already working to connect the issues facing working families to the right to vote. This past weekend at the Congressional Progressive Caucus summit, we heard from Reverend William Barber II, organizer of Moral Mondays, who emphasized the need to address voting rights. While the right to vote is inherent throughout our nation’s founding documents, there is nothing in the Constitution that explicitly guarantees our right to vote.As authors of a constitutional amendment to affirm the right to vote, we believe it is crucial to frame Thursday’s debate around voting rights. The people should be selecting their leaders, not the other way around. Our democracy is strongest when everyone is able to participate and it is time to fulfill that promise to the American people.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. — U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Keith Ellison (D-MN), today introduced H.J.Res.25 with Reps. Steve Cohen (D-TN) and Judy Chu (D-CA) and 21 House Democrats to explicitly guarantee the right to vote in the Constitution. The Pocan-Ellison Right to Vote Amendment would amend the U.S. Constitution to provide all Americans with the affirmative right to vote and protect this fundamental right.  While most Americans believe an explicit right to vote is enshrined in our Constitution, the Constitution in fact contains no expressed guarantee of an individual\\'s right to vote, a point that was confirmed by the Supreme Court\\'s decision in Bush v. Gore. Only a constitutional amendment can ensure this right will be guaranteed in the future.\"A core principle of our democracy is the ability for citizens to participate in the election of their representatives,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"We have seen constant attempts by some states to erode voting rights and make it harder for citizens to vote. This amendment would affirm the principle of equal participation in our democracy for every citizen. As the world\\'s leading democracy, we must guarantee the right to vote for all.\"\"Our nation is stronger when we make it easy for Americans to participate in democracy,\" Rep. Keith Ellison said.  \"But states all over the country are passing laws to make it harder to vote. A guaranteed right to vote in the Constitution would go a long way towards increasing access to the ballot box for all Americans.\"\\n      Image    \"With more than 300 successful voting rights lawsuits over the last 2 decades, the Supreme Court striking down critical Voting Rights Act protections, and states across the South making it harder for citizens to vote, it is clear that more must be done to protect this cornerstone of our democracy,\" said Congressman Steve Cohen. \"Our constitutional amendment would clearly and unequivocally guarantee the right to vote for each and every American, and would be an important step forward in the march for civil rights.\"\"It is shocking that in a country dedicated to the principle of government by the people, for the people, there is no constitutionally enshrined right to vote,\" said Rep. Judy Chu. \"Without a right to vote, minorities are at risk of being excluded. We saw this when women were told to keep out of government, we saw it in the Jim Crow South, and I\\'ve seen it in my own family\\'s experience with the Chinese Exclusion Act. Universal suffrage is still recent in American history, and it is dismaying to see it already under attack by status quo stalwarts who fear the diversity that makes America so great. That is why I am a proud original cosponsor of the Right to Vote Constitutional Amendment that makes it clear once and for all that citizens have a fundamental right to vote. It will put a stop to the ongoing assault on voting rights we are seeing across the nation.  Finally, the ability to take part in our elections will be equal to the ability to speak freely. \"Today, I am honored to join in support of Congressmen Mark Pocan and Keith Ellison as they introduce legislation that would add a right to vote amendment to the U.S. Constitution,\" said Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, Sr. \"As our civil and human rights democratic movement continues to struggle for full equality for all Americans, it\\'s not obvious that there was a ‘before Selma\\' dimension to our struggle for voting rights, but that there must also be a ‘beyond Selma\\' dimension.\"While the right to vote is essential to our democracy, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, at least 83 restrictive bills were introduced in 29 states whose legislatures have had floor activity in 2014, including efforts to require a photo ID, make voter registration more difficult, reduce early voting opportunities, and make it harder for students to vote.The text of the amendment is below:SECTION 1: Every citizen of the United States, who is of legal voting age, shall have the fundamental right to vote in any public election held in the jurisdiction in which the citizen resides.SECTION 2: Congress shall have the power to enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation.',\n",

Pocan continued. \"I am especially pleased President Obama pushed for critical infrastructure investments. These investments will provide good jobs for hard-working Americans and ensure our country has a 21st century transportation system to compete in the global marketplace.\"I also support President Obama\\'s plan to close the income inequality gap by raising fees on the largest financial institutions and restoring tax fairness by reinstating the Reagan era capital gains tax rate for the highest earners to 28 percent to pay for initiatives which will benefit the middle-class and tax breaks for hard working Americans,\" said Rep. Pocan. \"Investing in education opportunities will also ease the economic squeeze on working families.\"While I support much of what the President had to say tonight, I am disappointed he pushed for an expansion of our nation\\'s flawed trade policies,\" Rep. Pocan said. \"I support fair trade, but I cannot support more bad trade deals that will hurt our American jobs and American industries.  I hope President Obama and U.S. Trade Representative Froman are open to the concerns my colleagues and I have expressed about the consequences of fast-track legislation and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations.\"Now that President Obama has laid out his agenda to help grow the middle-class and sustain our economic recovery, the onus is now on Congress to act,\" concluded Rep. Pocan. \"The American people cannot wait any longer for a gridlocked Congress to take action.  It is time to move our country forward, but we can only make progress if we work together to increase opportunities for every single American.\"\\n      Image',\n",

But the efforts to live up to Dr. King’s call to “make real the promises of democracy” continue. While the March on Washington is largely credited with inspiring the passage of the landmark Voting Right Act of 1965, we now face renewed threats to our fundamental right to vote. We do a disservice to the memories of Dr. King and Bayard Rustin if we do not protect against forces wishing to promote the rights of certain citizens while limiting those of others.“That is why I have introduced an amendment to the U.S. Constitution enshrining the right to vote. Passage of this amendment will mean that no matter who you are, where you live, or where you come from, every American would have the right to vote, and the ability to protect their individual rights and freedoms.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON—U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Keith Ellison (D-MN), authors of the Right to Vote Amendment that would provide an affirmative constitutional right to vote for all Americans, today issued the following statement after the Supreme Court rejected Section 4 of the landmark Voting Right Act, which contains a formula to determine specified jurisdictions that need federal government approval before making voting changes that could be racially discriminatory. In its ruling on Shelby County v. Holder, the Court determined that the current formula was outdated. Congress is now required to pass a new formula that reflects current conditions. “Today’s Supreme Court decision is an assault on what should be our most fundamental right as Americans. While the Court is correct that current law to protect voters from discriminatory voting laws is outdated, it is because it’s not expansive enough. The right to vote is under attack across the country. Already in 2013, more than 30 states have introduced over 80 restrictive voting laws that often target low-income, student, elderly and minority voters. “As disappointed as we are by today’s decision, it demonstrates why we cannot wait to enact a constitutional amendment that would guarantee an affirmative right to vote for all Americans—no matter where they live. A country built on the foundation of civic participation should never tolerate any politically-motivated threats to our ability to express our views at the polls. We will continue to work with our colleagues and build the grassroots support needed to ensure we protect our right to vote.” Last month, Pocan and Ellison introduced legislation to explicitly guarantee the right to vote in the Constitution. The Pocan-Ellison Right to Vote Amendment would amend the Constitution to provide all Americans the affirmative right to vote and empower Congress to protect this right.

The ironically titled “Preventing Greater Uncertainty in Labor-Management Relations Act” would in fact promote more uncertainty for both employees and employers by preventing the NLRB from issuing any new decisions or enforcing existing decisions.The bill, which will be voted on by the U.S. House of Representatives today, arrives at the same time Senate Republicans are filibustering President Obama’s nominations to the NLRB in a transparent attempt to reduce its authority and deny rights and protections to millions of Americans across the country.“It seems there are no limits that some will go to deny hardworking Americans with the rights and protections they are legally entitled to,” Pocan said. “By effectively dissolving the NLRB, this bill would lead to unnecessary chaos by severely damaging labor relations and creating further uncertainty for both employees and employers. Without a legal avenue for workers to pursue, employers could be emboldened to ignore existing regulations, and worker strikes could become more prevalent since unions would be left with no other recourse.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Pocan (WI-02),\\xa0a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee,\\xa0released the following statement after he voted against the Bipartisan Budget Bill:“For months, I have been calling on Speaker McCarthy to put a clean debt ceiling bill on the floor to avoid bringing our nation to the brink of an unnecessary economic catastrophe, just as we did three times under President Trump and 78 times since 1960. Instead, he and his Republican colleagues chose to engage in hostage-taking, refusing to raise the debt ceiling to avoid default unless paired with devastating cuts to essential government programs. While I am relieved the President and Democratic Leadership were able to walk back the worst of the Republicans’ demands, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I was unable to support this final agreement due to remaining unanswered questions.“This bill critically undercuts the appropriations process, one of the last processes in Washington where Democrats and Republicans work together. Severely restraining domestic spending while continuing to inflate unchecked defense spending for the Pentagon shows Republicans are not actually serious about addressing the deficit.\\xa0“With too many unanswered questions and unknown, undisclosed side deals, including a shortfall of $58 billion in promised domestic funding not explicitly guaranteed in the language of the bill for things like education, healthcare, and more, I could not, in good conscience, vote for this bill.\\xa0“In addition to my serious concerns about the impacts to the appropriations process and backroom deals, this bill expands SNAP work requirements for older Americans and threatens cash assistance for the lowest-income families, while simultaneously rescinding critical IRS investments intended to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. Moreover, this bill weakens key environmental and climate protections.\\xa0“While I am relieved that we will avoid an economic default, I remain steadfast that we never should have had to engage with an extreme MAGA Republican dominated caucus in hostage negotiations over Americans’ livelihoods to begin with. Looking forward, we should eliminate the unnecessary debt ceiling to avoid any question of the full faith and credit of the United States.”',\n",

This bill takes a step forward in getting us on the right track to create economic opportunity for all in the 21stcentury and beyond.\" Congressman Pocan\\'s surface transportation projects included in the INVEST in America Act are listed below. $6.275 million to reconstruct Atwood Ave. in Madison from Fair Oaks to Cottage Grove Rd.  This project will reconstruct the existing roadway with pedestrian and bicycle multi-use paths and reconstruct a portion of the popular Lake Loop Bike Path.$2 million to replace the functionally obsolete and structurally deficient bridge over Pheasant Branch in the City of Middleton on County Highway M/Century Ave.  A bike tunnel and trail improvements will be included in the project to connect the existing bike network.$2 million to resurface County Highway CV along the northern and western boundary of the Dane County Regional Airport and include on-road bike facilities and replace drainage structures.$2 million to resurface and widen County Highway CC in the Town and Village of Oregon which will enable on-road bike lanes.  Curbs, gutters, and ditches in areas within the Village of Oregon would also be improved.$2 million to resurface and widen County Highway P and improve on-road bike lanes.  Replacing and/or widening drainage structures would also occur, and curbs and gutters will replace ditches in areas within the unincorporated Village of Klevenville.  The Military Ridge Trail Cross would also be improved.$2 million to repair 6.56 miles of deteriorating pavement on US 14 between Spring Green and Madison.$1.6 million to convert the existing WIS 23/WIS 136 intersection in Reedsburg into a single lane roundabout in response to multiple fatal crashes that have occurred at the intersection over the last four years.  Wisconsin roundabouts have been demonstrated to reduce the number of crashes resulting in death or injury by more than half.$125,000 to resurface Highway 033 in Reedsburg from Preston Ave. to State Highway 023.See Congressman Pocan\\'s initial letter to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure requesting these projects here.

       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI—Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02) released the following statement in response to the Wisconsin Supreme Court\\'s reversal of Governor Evers\\' emergency order threatening millions of dollars every month in federal food assistance for Wisconsinites. \"As Wisconsin once again sees a rise in COVID-19 cases and deaths, now is not the time to challenge public health orders and threaten food security for thousands of Wisconsinites. Overturning the Governor\\'s emergency order means Wisconsin could very likely lose $50 million per month in additional federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funds that so many Wisconsinites have relied on during this pandemic.  \"I urge the Republican-controlled legislature to step in for the people of Wisconsin to issue an emergency order to protect Wisconsinites and ensure we don\\'t lose crucial food assistance for Wisconsin families. The state legislature has already opposed expanding Medicaid to cover nearly 91,000 additional low-income people—which would have saved Wisconsin $1.6 billion over the next two years. Pair that with the $50 million we will lose monthly in federal food benefits, and the Wisconsin GOP is not only forcing hundreds of thousands of families to go hungry, but they are being inexplicably fiscally irresponsible. Acting now will not only help people in need, but also protect taxpayers from an unneeded loss of federal funds. Any other action is fiscally irresponsible.\" During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Agriculture has allocated additional emergency SNAP aid to states that have enacted emergency orders. Governor Evers\\' emergency order—which included the statewide mask mandate—ensured that Wisconsinites would receive millions in additional federal food assistance. Without the emergency order or additional action by the state legislature, Wisconsin could lose that aid.',\n",

       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI—Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Barbara Lee (D-CA) led a group of 29 Democrats demanding that this year\\'s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorize a level of spending below last year\\'s budget, in a letter to House Armed Services Committee (HASC) leadership this morning.Since the start of the Trump administration, defense spending has increased every year—over $100 billion, almost 20%, in three years. Now more than ever, in the middle of a global pandemic, we cannot allow this ballooning spending to be directed towards this president\\'s warmongering. Over 90,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, and we must focus our spending efforts on the expansion of testing, contact tracing, treatment, vaccine development and relief for the people of this country. Last year\\'s NDAA authorized $738 billion in defense spending for FY20, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) got 1/90th of that: less than $8 billion.\"We are facing a crisis in this country and billions of dollars in defense spending increases won\\'t solve it,\" said Congressman Pocan. \"Year after year, we see taxpayer dollars line the pocket of defense contractors instead of supporting the American public. The enemy we\\'re fighting right now is COVID-19, so our sole focus should be on expanding testing, tracing and treatment, funding towards vaccine development, and relief for the American people. Increasing defense spending now would be a slap in the face to the families of over 90,000 Americans that have died from this virus.\"\"Year after year, the Pentagon budget has inflated to historic levels while the vital needs of everyday people are left unmet,\" said Congresswoman Lee. \"The COVID pandemic has laid bare how America has failed to make its budgets reflect the real needs of our everyday families. It\\'s long past time that we address our bloated military budget and retarget resources towards policies and programs that matter the most for keeping us safe, healthy, and secure.\"Last year\\'s House NDAA passed out of the House of Representatives in July with zero Republican votes and eight Democratic \"NO\" votes—both Pocan and Lee voted against last year\\'s defense spending increase. Republicans withstanding, 19 Democrats would need to vote \"NO\" this year for the bill to fail. 29 Democrats signed this letter.This letter was co-signed by Representatives Blumenauer (D-OE), Cohen (D-TN), DeFazio (D-OR), DeGette (D-CO), Espaillat (D-NY), Evans (D-PA), J.

From denying his request for border wall funding and refusing to defund sanctuary cities, to reducing the number of detention beds for undocumented immigrants, many of President Trump\\'s signature campaign promises were left out of this bill. Further, the Trump Administration\\'s budget request was largely rejected, meaning that some proposed cuts to critical programs will not occur, and Trump-DeVos priorities such as new dollars for school choice programs will go unfunded.

       "  'date': 'April 15, 2016',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Reps. Jim Renacci (OH-16) and Mark Pocan (WI-02) were joined by Reps. Daniel Webster (FL-10), John Carney (DE at-large), Derek Kilmer (WA-06), and Richard Hanna (NY-22) to introduce bipartisan legislation to eliminate a Washington-created budget gimmick and protect employees and their employers.Under current law, pension insurance premiums that are paid by employers to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) are included in the federal budget and are considered “on-budget.”  This provides the illusion this revenue can be used for general government spending, even though these premiums cannot be allocated to other government programs besides the PBGC benefit pension plans.  In recent years, Congress has increased the PBGC premiums several times in order to off-set increased spending; most recently increasing premiums through 2025 by $7.65 billion in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. The Pension and Budget Integrity Act simply moves these premiums “off-budget”, and ensures that Congress is raising premiums only if and when it is appropriate. “For too long Congress has raised pension premiums as a gimmick to balance the budget on the backs of working class Americans,” said Rep. Mark Pocan. “This legislation will ensure that when Congress chooses to increase these premiums, it does so for the benefit of the PBGC and pension beneficiaries.”“We need to improve our country’s fiscal health by balancing the federal budget, and it cannot be done with accounting gimmicks.  In this case, the pension premiums are being raised in order to pay for our federal programs, but in reality that revenue will only be allotted to PBGC plans.  Budget gimmicks only result in contributing to our nation’s growing debt.  Our commonsense, bipartisan bill promotes sound budgetary policy and helps protect the PBGC from losing vital premium contributors,” Rep. Jim Renacci said.“Far too often, the federal budgeting process includes technical maneuvering for the purpose of swaying perception or public opinion. Over the past few years, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) has fallen victim to this distorted practice. I applaud Rep. Renacci for his bipartisan legislation to eliminate this budget gimmick and join his efforts to make the federal government more transparent and accountable in their spending,” Rep. Daniel Webster said.“The Pension and Budget Integrity Act protects the retirement income of hard-working Americans from congressional budgeting tricks. Over the years, Congress has used this stunt instead of working on bipartisan solutions that would honestly deal with our spending. This bill is a step in the right direction towards a more responsible way of spending,” Rep. John Carney said.“American workers deserve to know that their retirement earnings will continue to be safe,” said Rep. Derek Kilmer. “For too long pension premiums paid by employers have been at risk from Congressional budget stunts. Our bipartisan bill ensures that Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation funds are not subjected to the Congressional budget making process so workers can have peace of mind and we can focus on actually balancing our budget.”',\n",

Mark Pocan (D-WI) today released the Progressive Caucus’ budget for fiscal year 2017, called The People’s Budget: Prosperity Not Austerity; Invest in America.“The People’s Budget reverses harmful austerity cuts and fixes a system that for far too long has only benefited those at the top,” Rep. Pocan said. “The Progressive Caucus Budget rebuilds our crumbling roads and bridges, creates good paying jobs, and increases educational opportunities from pre-kindergarten to college. Our budget invests in the American people and gives working families the best opportunity to get ahead.” “The People’s Budget is a true expression of progressive values,” Rep. Grijalva said. “More than numbers and charts, our budget is a path forward for the American people who’ve had their wages flat line and savings erode. It alleviates our overcrowded classrooms where kids struggle to learn, and makes higher education a reality for any student committed to earning a college degree. It ensures profit motives and systemic inequalities have no place in our criminal justice system or our immigration policies. The investments we detail will create jobs, protect the environment and promote growth by requiring the wealthiest among us, corporations and Wall Street to contribute their fair share to our society. While Republicans continue fighting over how much more seniors should sacrifice, The People’s Budget shows that their harmful cuts are a false prophecy for American economic success.”“It’s time to invest in our country and in working people who simply want to provide for their families,” Rep. Ellison said. “The People’s Budget helps families by creating jobs, improving education, and rebuilding our roads and bridges. We’ve seen what good investments can do in the Twin Cities. After the Green Line Light Rail was completed in 2014, businesses have grown and another $2.5 billion in private investment has poured in along the route.  In cities like Flint, Michigan, we see what happens when governments put cutting costs ahead of people’s health. The state government’s refusal to invest in Flint has resulted in lead exposure for thousands of residents - all because the state government wanted to cut corners. A tragedy like Flint cannot happen again. We can and should make fair investments in America, and The People’s Budget is the best path forward.”   The executive summary for The People’s Budget is below and the full budget can be found here.The People’s Budget Executive SummaryWhile our economy is rebounding from the Great Recession, hardworking Americans are being left behind. Our economic and political system has lost sight of what matters most: We the People. The Congressional Progressive Caucus’ Budget for Fiscal Year 2017 provides major reinvestments in our country through infrastructure, education, and wage growth to increase opportunity for all. The People’s Budget is a down payment on a brighter future for all Americans, ensuring every family struggling to make ends meet has a fair shot at the American Dream.An investment in roads, bridges, and railways is an investment in the safety and prosperity of the American people. The People’s Budget commits $1 trillion in infrastructure spending overall to transform our country’s crumbling roads, bridges, and facilities into a 21st century network, creating jobs and improving economic opportunities in the process. This includes billions for water lines nationwide and $765 million specifically for Flint, Michigan, to replace toxic pipelines and provide needed health, education, and other services for residents exposed to lead. Families should never have to worry about whether their water is safe to drink, or their roads are safe to drive on. Access to equitable education opportunities is key to ensuring future generations are prepared for success. From pre-school through college, every student deserves the right to high-quality affordable education. The People’s Budget invests in our students by providing robust early learning opportunities, effective public schools for all students, and debt-free college. The People’s Budget creates 3.6 million good paying jobs to push our economy back to full-employment, which will provide the necessary economic conditions to spur across-the-board wage growth for hardworking Americans. It empowers working families, protects collective bargaining, and seeks to close the pay equity gap. It also increases funding for worker protection agencies to crack down on wage theft, combat overtime abuses, and safeguard workers’ retirement savings. Now is the time for Congress to remove the barriers that have held down wages for working Americans.The People’s Budget makes major public investments to rebuild America by fixing our crumbling roads and bridges, improving schools, moving towards clean energy, and creating good paying jobs in the process.# # #',\n",

There are currently only five legislative days left for Speaker Boehner to find a solution to keep the government open.\"We seem to have short memories here in Congress, but the last time the Tea Party engineered a government shutdown, our economy lost $24 billion and 120,000 jobs,\" said Rep. Pocan. \"As a member of the Budget Committee and a small business owner for nearly 30 years, I know businesses and workers across the country struggle to cope with this continual fiscal uncertainty and legislative chaos. Our economic growth should not be jeopardized because a small number of right wing extremists want to cut access to health care services for millions of Americans. Forcing a government shutdown is not the action of responsible adults and I urge Speaker Boehner to work with Democrats to keep our government open. It\\'s time for Congress to grow up.\"\"A Republican-led government shutdown would not only wreak havoc on our economy, but it would also further delay action on finding a long term fix to the Highway Trust Fund, reforming our broken immigration system, and many other important issues that need attention,\" said Rep. Ellison. \"But worst of all, a shutdown will negatively affect millions of people, as it will stop the paychecks that hundreds of thousands of Americans depend on to put food on the table. It will also prevent seniors and veterans from getting the benefits they need to make ends meet and keep children out of head start educational programs. If the Republican Leadership chooses to cede power to the most extreme members of the Republican caucus, working Americans, seniors, military veterans, and students will be hit hardest. I urge Speaker Boehner to work with Members of Congress who recognize that the American people do not want, and cannot afford another government shutdown.\"\"It is a sad fact about politics today that the American people are faced with a government shutdown every time a new fiscal year begins in Washington,\" said Rep. Grijalva. \"As the list mounts of urgent issues Republicans are neglecting, the American people are left to wonder why they\\'re facing another self-inflicted wound from people elected to lead this nation.

We remain deeply concerned about the economic impacts of the shutdown on the American people.The 2013 government shutdown not only undermined people\\'s faith in our government domestically and internationally, it cost the American taxpayers $24 billion dollars. On September 18, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen further warned that a government shutdown would jeopardize the country\\'s economic health. Shutting down the government is not only irresponsible; it is costly and risks Americans\\' economic security. Congress\\' to-do list is growing.  Before the end of the year, Congress must pass a transportation and infrastructure bill, a number of tax-extenders, the child nutrition reauthorization, Perkins Loan Program reauthorization, the Export-Import Bank reauthorization, raise the debt ceiling, and update the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, among many other priorities. Given this, we urge you to work with the Members of Congress who are unwilling to risk the economic security of Americans, and avoid a government shutdown. Here\\'s a snapshot of the numbers from the last shutdown:-19,000 children served by Head Start grants lost access to their school facilities-2 billion dollars was lost as a result of payroll costs or lost productivity of furloughed workers-800+ U.S. Department of Agriculture food safety inspections were delayed-40,000+  veterans\\' disability claims were stalled-700 small business applications were unable to be processed, amounting in $140 million in delayed loans.-1,400 military service members experienced delays in services aimed to ease their transition into civilian life-Hundreds of critically sick Americans were prevented from enrolling in National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trials – with 98 percent of the National Science Foundation, nearly three-quarters of NIH, and two-thirds of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employees furloughedAs you move forward with negotiations, keep in mind the serious economic impact of the shutdown on American families and work with Congressional Democrats and Members who recognize we cannot afford another shutdown.Sincerely,Keith EllisonRaúl M.

       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C — U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Budget Committee, today issued the following statement on the Republican Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Resolution:\"Budgets show our priorities, and what is clear is House Republicans want hard-working Americans to work harder for less.  Since the financial crisis, real wages for American workers have barely grown at all. This budget does nothing to help working families get ahead or improve employment opportunities and paychecks. Instead, it is chock-full of tax giveaways to the wealthy and expands a tax code already tilted to benefit the top 1 percent. Our country deserves a budget which benefits every American, not just the wealthy few.\"This budget proposal makes it harder for middle-class families to pay for college and does not provide a single penny to address the $1.2 trillion student loan debt crisis. Republican cuts to education are essentially ensuring the future belongs to the privileged few by greasing the ladders of opportunity for children from middle-class families and making a college education less affordable.  Repeated cuts to education will hurt our nation\\'s economy over the long-term and our ability to compete in the global economy.\"Under the Republican plan, the promise of a secure retirement after a lifetime of hard work will be a thing of the past. Their plan once again ends the Medicare guarantee and makes deep cuts to the safety net for America\\'s seniors. Seniors on Medicare will have to pay more for preventive health services and prescription drugs, in essence a tax hike on those who can afford it the least.  \"These are not my values or the values of my constituents in South Central Wisconsin. I understand tough choices need to be made when coming up with a budget. But balancing budgets on the backs of seniors, students, and working families is a reckless and irresponsible choice.  Congress should work together to develop a budget for the American people which creates good-paying jobs and expands economic opportunity for all.\"###',\n",

       "  'date': 'September 11, 2014',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today introduced three pieces of legislation to close tax loopholes which allow U.S. corporations to use so-called \"tax inversions\" to reduce a company\\'s tax burden. \"Large corporations have taken advantage of tax loopholes to hide billions in corporate profits overseas and avoid paying taxes in the United States,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"Enough is enough.  This legislation will stop corporate deserters from abusing the U.S. tax system.  Main street businesses across Wisconsin and across the United States are playing by the rules and paying their share while Wall Street corporations, with their teams of lawyers, are finding new tax loopholes to avoid paying their share of taxes; that\\'s just wrong.\"A recent report by Bloomberg shows multinational companies accumulated nearly $2 trillion in accounts outside the U.S., in 2013 – an increase of 11.8 percent as corporations shift more profits to offshore tax havens.The Obama Administration is also considering executive action to curtail tax benefits for U.S. companies that use inversions to reduce their tax burden.BACKGROUNDCorporate inversion is a process by which an existing U.S. corporation changes its country of residence, typically to one that has lower tax rates and less stringent corporate regulations.  The process involves re-incorporating overseas in order to reduce the tax burden on income earned abroad. Corporate inversions are used by companies that receive a significant portion of their income from foreign sources.LEGISLATION:Corporate Fair Share Tax Act\"Earnings stripping is even more costly than standard inversions,\" said Rep. Pocan. \"This legislation closes the loophole used by companies to shirk paying their taxes and eliminates the advantage for companies to shift debt here.\"Policy summary:This provision cracks down on corporate earnings stripping, a method of avoiding taxes in which U.S.-based groups are loaded up with debt owed to the affiliated foreign company; the U.S. entity then pays high levels of interest on this debt, which nets them significant tax deductions or wipes out taxable income in the U.S. Specifically, the provision limits the deductions a corporation may claim to a level at which the U.S. entity\\'s share of interest on debt is proportionate to the U.S. entity\\'s share of earnings. The Treasury Department estimates this would increase revenue by $48.6 billion over the next ten years.Putting America First Corporate Tax Act\"Today, corporations are not required to pay taxes on overseas profits immediately,\" said Rep. Pocan. \"This legislation closes an egregious loophole and requires companies to pay taxes on overseas profits immediately instead of postponing payments and indefinitely hide income in tax havens.\"Policy summary:Currently corporations can defer paying taxes on foreign profits until that money is repatriated back to the U.S., often via dividends to shareholders. Our provision changes Section 956 of the tax code to close this loophole and require controlled foreign corporations to pay U.S. taxes on future active income beginning on December 31, 2014. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that ending this loophole would increase revenue over the next ten years by $114 billion.Corporate Transparency and Accountability Act\"The American people deserve to know which companies are avoiding paying their taxes\" said Rep. Pocan.  \"This legislation will increase transparency on corporate financial reports and ensure the data is easily available to the public.\"Policy summary:This provision restores a previous requirement of corporations to disclose both pre-tax profits and the total amount paid in state and federal taxes. The language also mandates this information be publicly available on the SEC website in a way that is searchable, sortable, and downloadable.###',\n",

Mark Pocan (WI-02) today joined Roman Candle Pizza founder and owner, Brewer Stouffer, and Wisconsin Business Alliance Executive Director, Lori Compas at a press conference to call on Congress to close the so-called \"inversion\" corporate tax loophole and address the broader issue of corporate tax avoidance. The press conference at Roman Candle Pizza highlighted how companies have taken advantage of the U.S. tax code through inversions, opening offshore subsidiaries and tax havens to avoid paying taxes in the United States.\"It is time Congress stop corporate deserters from abusing the U.S. tax system and avoid paying taxes,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"Main street businesses like Roman Candle Pizza and thousands of others across Wisconsin are playing by the rules and paying their share while Wall Street corporations are finding new ways to dodge taxes. Corporations that avoid paying their taxes put the burden on American families and small businesses who have to shoulder a heavier load.\"Large corporations have taken advantage of the U.S. tax code to put billions in corporate profits in overseas accounts to avoid paying taxes in the United States. President Obama and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew have called on Congress to take action to permanently close the \"inversion\" tax loophole and save nearly $20 billion over 10 years, according to an estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation.  \"Tax inversion is not a left-or a right issue, but an issue for all American taxpayers,\" said Brewer Stouffer, founder and owner of The Roman Candle Pizza. \"Every business that has a shop or an office or a factory in the US is benefitting from all the services and opportunities our country and communities provide. They should pay for the privilege. Let\\'s make sure that all companies are playing by the same rules that The Roman Candle and most small business do every day.\" A report by Bloomberg shows multinational companies accumulated $1.95 trillion outside the U.S., in 2013 – an increase of 11.8 percent as corporations shift more profits to offshore tax havens.\"Congress should close the tax loopholes that allow large corporations to get out of their responsibility and require corporations to disclose the amount of federal income taxes that they pay,\" said Wisconsin Business Alliance Executive Director, Lori Compas. \"When large corporations use safe drinking water, schools, roads, and police and fire protection use just like we do, but then try to avoid their responsibility by relocating overseas, it hurts our local economy and leaves small businesses like ours footing the bill.

Mark Pocan (WI-02) today called on Congress to take steps to restore tax fairness for America’s middle class families.“It’s clear our tax code unfairly benefits the wealthiest Americans, while middle class families struggle to make ends meet.  Economic inequality has grown over the past decade and it’s time for Congress to work together on tax reforms to fix this injustice.  We must close unfair tax loopholes, end special interest tax breaks for corporations, and reform the tax code to support the creation and retention of good-paying jobs here in the United States,\" said Representative Pocan.According to an analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice, the Republican budget would raise taxes on middle class families with children by more than $2,000 per year to pay for an average tax cut of $200,000 for the very wealthy and corporations shipping jobs overseas.  The Republican proposal would also shift long-term costs onto the backs of seniors and the middle-class by turning Medicare it into a voucher program and slashing investments in infrastructure and the education of our children.“Unlike the Republican budget, Democrats have put forward plans to cut taxes for the middle class and small businesses to spur economic growth and build an economy that works for everyone,” continued Representative Pocan. “We should not mortgage the future of our children to pay for tax cuts for millionaires and corporations shipping jobs overseas.  Together, we can close the opportunity gap by strengthening the middle class, creating jobs, investing in our infrastructure and our children’s education, and responsibly reducing the deficit.”###',\n",

Mark Pocan (WI-02) today issued the following statement on House passage of the Republican budget proposal:“For the 4th year in a row House Republicans have laid out a road map for what they would do if they controlled the House, Senate, and the White House,” said Representative Pocan. “The consequences of the Republican budget would be very real to the 3 million Americans who could lose their jobs, the millions of seniors who would see Medicare turned into a voucher program, and the millions of students who would see higher student loan rates and interest payments. Luckily for 98% of Americans who would be hurt by the Republican budget, it is not going anywhere.”According to the Economic Policy Institute, the GOP-Ryan budget would have a devastating impact on American workers and the larger economy.  EPI estimates that the Republican budget plan would decrease GDP by 0.9 percent and decrease nonfarm payrolls by 1.1 million jobs in fiscal year 2015, compared to CBO’s current-law baseline. In 2016, when the Republican budget cuts to discretionary spending starts, GDP would decrease by 2.5 percent and cost 3.0 million jobs – the equivalent of firing Wisconsin’s entire workforce.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today introduced an amendment to the Republican FY2015 budget proposal which would raise the minimum wage for nearly 28 million Americans, including more than 500,000 Wisconsinites, and lift millions of people out of poverty:“America deserves a raise,” said Representative Pocan. “The minimum wage has less value today than it did in 1968 and American workers have not seen an increase in the minimum wage since 2009.  Raising the minimum wage would benefit 28 million Americans immediately and lift millions out of poverty.  This would help stimulate the economy immediately by making sure people have money in their pockets and that money is put back into the economy immediately.” Representative Pocan’s amendment would increase the minimum wage over three years from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour, indexes future annual increases to inflation thereafter, and gradually increases the tipped minimum wage to 70 percent of the minimum wage. The current minimum wage pays only $15,080 per year. Raising the minimum wage is critical to help lift those working hard to support their families out of poverty.  A majority of minimum wage workers are women and the average worker who would get this raise is 35 years old.“The myth of a minimum wage worker is a teenager living with their parents while working part-time after school,” Representative Pocan continued.  “In fact, the minimum wage worker is a very real person in all of our districts who has had a stagnant wage while the rest of the economy has prospered.  Raising the minimum wage is a win-win-win situation – a win for workers, a win for small businesses, and a win for the economy.”###',\n",

Instead of focusing on jobs, House Republicans continue to pursue an agenda that does nothing for Americans struggling to find work. Speaker John Boehner seems content to sit on the sidelines as more than 1.7 million Americans, including 31,000 Wisconsinites, try to cope with the loss of their unemployment insurance. Leaving these Americans out in the cold not only makes it harder for them to find work, but also does unnecessary harm to our economy.

While I commend the budget conference committee on its work to reach a deal, just because Congress has a deal does not mean Congress has done its job.“I am thankful this proposal provides some minor relief over the next two years from the devastating, across-the-board sequester cuts that were set to once again hit critical programs in Wisconsin. Unfortunately, sequestration will continue to do needless harm to our families, our students and our economy in the coming year and for years to come. We must continue to work on a solution to replace these harmful cuts once and for all.  “At the end of the day, the bill abandons 1.3 million Americans who desperately need unemployment insurance, and does nothing to promote economic growth or job creation. Furthermore, the legislation is paid for on the backs of the middle class and military families, while not touching the wealthiest amongst us and allowing corporations to continue to benefit from tax loopholes.”“Congress shouldn’t be patting ourselves on the back just because we didn’t shoot ourselves in the foot. After a year marked by petty partisanship and Tea Party obstructionism, we have to do better. The challenges of growing our economy and strengthening the middle class are too important to keep kicking down the road. There is more work to do, and I urge the House to stay in Washington until we do it.”Pocan was also disappointed that the deal only blocks a scheduled cut in payments for doctors under Medicare (also called the SGR formula) for three months.

Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Budget Committee, today encouraged his colleagues to ensure their work focuses on the top problem facing our country: the need for further economic growth that will get the people of Wisconsin and America back to work.It has been four years since Congress has passed a budget. “The top priority of any budget plan should be helping to get the people of Wisconsin and this country back to work.  As the CBO has reported, nearly three-fourths of our deficit in 2014 will be caused by unemployment and underemployment in our economy. The first step the committee should take to promote job creation is to end the indiscriminate sequester cuts that estimates show will cut 36,000 jobs in Wisconsin. The committee should also prioritize investments in areas that spur economic development—from education to infrastructure to innovative research.“I also believe that where there is wasteful government spending, or programs that would benefit from reform, we should address those concerns. That includes wasteful tax breaks to corporations and special interests that add to our yearly deficits. Any balanced plan considered by the committee should include revenue options in addition to any potential cuts.“However, I do not believe, and I will not support, any plan that tries to solve our country’s economic woes by cutting benefits to programs such as Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid relied upon by our neediest citizens.  We do not create jobs or grow our economy by denying seniors and the poorest Americans needed support.“Democrats and Republicans must work together and do our jobs. That means our nation needs a national budget—a roadmap that lays out our priorities and guides our future.”The Budget Conference Committee has until December 13th to finish its work.',\n",

Although we have avoided an economic calamity for now, Congress has failed to produce a budget for the past four years. We will not be able to take needed action on job growth, ending the indiscriminate sequester cuts, or protecting Social Security and Medicare for generations to come unless we make a concerted effort to work together and push the partisan gamesmanship aside.  “As we move forward on negotiations on a full-year budget, I am hopeful Congress learns from the lessons of this past month and puts country over ideology.”###',\n",

       "  'date': 'October 15, 2013',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—Just two days until the government reaches its borrowing limit and risks defaulting on its loans, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today highlighted the severe effects a government default would have on nearly every single Wisconsinite. While certain Republicans have recently claimed that breaching the country’s debt limit would have a minimal impact, a new report from the minority on the Ways and Means Committee confirms what most economists and financial leaders are saying: a default would be devastating to Wisconsin seniors, veterans, students, small businesses and middle class families. Pocan has joined many of his colleagues in calling for clean and long-term action on the debt limit that protects the stability of the U.S. economy.Raising the debt limit does not authorize new spending;  it simply allows the US Treasury to pay the bills we owe.“This is a manufactured crisis with serious real-life consequences for nearly every Wisconsinite,” said Pocan, a member of the House Budget Committee.  “If the stability of our economy and financial markets is threatened, Wisconsinites could see their hard-earned retirement savings lost, seniors and veterans could face delays in the monthly Social Security and disability checks they rely on, and the costs of homes and student loan rates could dramatically increase due to higher interest rates.  Refusing to raise the debt limit would constitute nothing short of fiscal malpractice; House Republicans need to stop threatening the full faith and credit of the United States and start working with House Democrats and the Senate on protecting the economic security for all Americans.” While more than 250,000 Wisconsin residents took out a home mortgage or refinanced their existing mortgage last year, the new analysis shows that mortgage rates could rise dramatically during a default, pushing up overall home loan costs. When Republicans threatened default in 2011, mortgage interest rate spreads increased by 0.7 percentage points. That same increase today would cost families an extra $100 a month, or $36,000 over the life of a typical 30-year home loan.Retirement savings are expected to fall significantly, potentially costing the average person in Wisconsin a drop of $15,000 in 401(k) assets and almost $23,000 in IRA assets just as they did in July and August 2011, when Republicans pushed the U.S. to the brink of default. More than 1.1 million Social Security recipients here in Wisconsin may not get their monthly checks and 57,745 disabled veterans may not get their pensions as the Treasury Department is unable to borrow. Student loans will cost significantly more. And doctors and hospitals may not get paid for treating patients with Medicare.The full Wisconsin analysis is available here.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON – Twelve days into the GOP-induced government shutdown that has furloughed Wisconsin workers, threatened the food security of 113,000 Wisconsin women and children, and stalled business for Wisconsin companies, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) took action today to force a vote to reopen the government. Pocan joined his colleagues in signing a discharge petition that would bypass Speaker Boehner and force the House to vote on a clean continuing resolution to fund the government, which has already been passed by the Senate and according to reports would pass the House. Thus far Speaker Boehner has refused to allow a vote on the legislation, even though it would allow the government to reopen right now.“We shouldn’t have to force a vote to reopen the government, but unfortunately the Tea Party-controlled Republicans continue to be more interested in stomping their feet and holding their breath than doing their jobs,” Pocan said. “Furloughed workers in Wisconsin and small business owners don’t have time to wait for Speaker Boehner to find the courage to stand up to the extreme wings of his party. We need to reopen the government, raise the debt ceiling and then sit down to negotiate a comprehensive, balanced and long-term budget. And we need to do it right now.” A discharge petition requires the House to consider a piece of legislation once a majority of Members of Congress have signed it. Seven discharge petitions have received 218 signatures over the last 30 years.Here are some of the ways the shutdown is hurting middle class families and small businesses in south central Wisconsin:The Wisconsin National  Guard is unable to perform its monthly trainings,  impacting both Guard readiness and the monthly incomes for Guard members (WEAU)The Small Business Administration (SBA) is not processing new loans—Last year, the SBA approved more than $83 million in loans in the second district  (SBA)85,000 Wisconsinites will lose their food stamps starting November 2nd if the federal government shutdown lasts till Oct. 17th; an additional 85,000 people will lose their benefits each subsequent day the government is shutdown (MJS)If the shutdown continues until the end of the month, the Women, Infants, and Children program (WIC) that provides nutrition support for mothers and children  will run out of money. About 113,000 Wisconsinites participate in the WIC program every month.  (AP)The shutdown effects federal financial aid, funding for academic research and Veterans Administration benefits to student at UW-Madison and throughout the UW-System. UW-Madison has received more than a dozen stop-work orders from federal agencies such as the National Institutes for Health and National Park Service for work being done by about 90 UW-Madison employees for those agencies.

       "  'date': 'April 22, 2013',\n",
       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI – One week after Congress missed its legal deadline to pass a final budget, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today called on Speaker John Boehner and House Republicans to stop blocking the budget process. Last week, Pocan sent a letter to Speaker John Boehner with his fellow House Budget Committee Democrats urging the Speaker to immediately appoint budget conferees so Congress can move forward and pass a final budget that lays out our national priorities.The legal deadline for Congress to pass a budget was April 15.“The people of Wisconsin and the nation deserve a federal budget that reflects our values and lays out our priorities—just like we produce in Wisconsin every year,” said Pocan, who served on the Joint Finance Committee in the Wisconsin State Assembly for six years. “Without a new, comprehensive federal budget, we cannot respond to emerging needs, cut wasteful programs or invest in new initiatives that support economic growth and our middle class families. Unfortunately, if my Republican colleagues refuse to appoint conferees, any progress toward a finalized budget will be halted. I urge my colleagues to come to the table and work on a budget solution that promotes American prosperity and job creation.”Normal legislative procedure dictates that since the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate have passed separate budgets, they convene a conference committee to work out the differences. Despite repeated calls in the past by House Republicans for the Senate to complete a budget, they are refusing to appoint conferees, and are now the only party standing in the way of advancing the budget process.“There are significant differences in opinion on how to best set the budget on a sustainable path, strengthen the economy and create well-paying jobs, and strengthen the programs providing the modest benefits that allow our seniors to live with dignity.  Yet, despite those disparate views, there is no excuse for dysfunction in Congress, and there can be no justification for the failure to engage in a meaningful attempt to find common ground,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter.“It is the responsibility of Congress to complete its business on time,” they said. “For so many Americans struggling to make ends meet, there can be no further delay.  On behalf of these men and women, we respectfully request that you proceed with appointments to a conference committee on the budget resolution.”The full text of the letter is below.April 17, 2013The Honorable John BoehnerSpeaker of the House of RepresentativesH-232, The CapitolWashington, DC 20515Dear Speaker Boehner,We write today to strongly urge the immediate appointment of conferees to negotiate a Fiscal Year 2014 reconciled budget resolution with the United States Senate.  Last month, the Senate joined the House of Representatives in passing a Concurrent Resolution on the budget.  Now that President Obama has provided his spending blueprint for the approaching fiscal year, it is the responsibility of both chambers to promptly organize a conference committee and proceed with budget deliberations under regular order.Clearly, there are aspects of all three proposals that will elicit strong debate between chambers and across the political spectrum.  However, the American people, many of whom are still enduring the effects of an economy in recovery, deserve no less than an honest and serious effort by the House and Senate to reconcile differences and move our nation forward by enacting a budget.There are significant differences in opinion on how to best set the budget on a sustainable path, strengthen the economy and create well-paying jobs, and strengthen the programs providing the modest benefits that allow our seniors to live with dignity.  Yet, despite those disparate views, there is no excuse for dysfunction in Congress, and there can be no justification for the failure to engage in a meaningful attempt to find common ground.The joint statement issued by Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan regarding efforts to proceed with regular order was an encouraging step.  Section 301 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 sets a statutory deadline of April 15 for Congress to complete action on adopting a joint budget resolution conference report– a deadline that Congress has already missed.  It is the responsibility of Congress to complete its business on time.  For so many Americans struggling to make ends meet, there can be no further delay.  On behalf of these men and women, we respectfully request that you proceed with appointments to a conference committee on the budget resolution.Sincerely,Chris Van Hollen (MD-08), Ranking MemberDavid Cicilline (RI-01)Allyson Schwartz (PA-13)John Yarmuth (KY-03)Bill Pascrell (NJ-08)Tim Ryan (OH-17)Gwen Moore (WI-04)Kathy Castor (FL-11)Jim McDermott (WA-07)Barbara Lee (CA-13)Hakeem Jeffries (NY-08)Mark Pocan (WI-02)Michelle Lujan Grisham (NM-01)Jared Huffman (CA-02)Tony Cardenas (CA-29)Earl Blumenauer (OR-03)Kurt Schrader (OR-05)###',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02), a member of the House Budget Committee, today expressed concern with the budget proposal released by President Obama. Pocan is disappointed with the decision to include a change in how benefits are calculated for Social Security recipients, also known as a chained CPI. According to the Social Security Administration, moving to a chained CPI formula would reduce an 85-year-old’s benefits by more than $1,100 a year.“The best way to reduce our long-term deficit is to get people back to work, and the president’s budget includes many strong initiatives that will help grow our economy and create jobs for south central Wisconsin. I am particularly pleased that the president’s proposal increases investments in the kind of  innovative research and development that is taking place at the University of Wisconsin, while also providing $50 billion for infrastructure projects that will put people back to work on much needed upgrades to our roads, bridges and airports. The president’s budget smartly focuses on promoting advanced manufacturing, as well as supporting small business owners through a tax credit for hiring new workers. His budget also replaces the irresponsible and indiscriminate sequester cuts that are currently leading to furloughs and unnecessary hardships in the second district.“However, while I respect the President’s desire to achieve a comprehensive and bipartisan budget proposal, I cannot support decreasing social security benefits to those just getting by, especially in the years when they need it most. Social security is a moral promise of economic security we make to our seniors, our veterans, people with disabilities, and our children, and it is a promise we cannot break. Social security has not contributed to our current fiscal problems, and cuts of any kind, including a chained CPI, should not be on the bargaining table. I cannot support any proposal that includes these types of Social Security benefit reductions.“I am proud to have signed onto a letter to the President with 106 of my Democratic colleagues explicitly expressing our opposition to chained CPI, and to any cuts to Social Security, to Medicare and to Medicaid benefits. Instead of cutting benefits to those who can least afford it, we should look at commonsense entitlement reforms, such as lifting the cap on earnings subject to the social security payroll tax, which would help extend the solvency of this critical program.“As the budget process continues, I hope to work with the President and my colleagues in Congress on balanced, substantive steps we can take to create jobs, reduce our long-term deficits and support our seniors and working families in Wisconsin.” ###',\n",

Once again, Republicans in the House have passed a budget that the American people do not support, and has no real chance of becoming law,” Pocan said. “This is a budget whose math is bogus, but whose consequences are real and serious for our middle class families in Wisconsin. From destroying jobs, to raising taxes on the middle class, to turning Medicare into a voucher system, it makes the wrong decisions and reflects the wrong priorities for Wisconsin.“But the biggest problem with the GOP budget is that it fails to tackle the greatest threat to our long-term deficit—our need to grow our economy and create jobs. With 12 million Americans still unemployed, and millions more who are underemployed, the best budget we can put forth is one that fosters job growth. When we get the people of Wisconsin and this country back to work, we will simultaneously fight our deficit and grow our economy.”“We will accomplish nothing though if Republicans insist on pushing rejected and recycled policies of the past. We need to work together on a responsible plan that aggressively invests in job growth—in education, in infrastructure and innovation—while cutting wasteful spending and redundant programs where they exist. We must continue to work to reduce health care costs and look at a variety of ways we can find savings and make Medicare more efficient and effective, as proposed in a number of Democratic proposals.  And we must decide that as a Congress, we are less interested in partisan posturing, and more interested on working on solutions that put our country on a path to economic prosperity.”The GOP Budget Proposal would have a devastating impact on Wisconsin families:Keeps the sequester cuts in place, meaning 36,000 Wisconsinites and 2 million Americans will lose their jobsTurns Medicare into a voucher program, forcing 873,753 Wisconsin seniors out of traditional MedicareIncreases tax breaks for the very wealthy and big business at the cost of $3,000 a year to middle class families.As a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, Rep.

It represents a dereliction of duty for the House Republican leadership to allow members to leave when hundreds of thousands of jobs are on the line and the economic security for middle class families is at risk.“All throughout the past few weeks, I’ve heard from my constituents and local business owners about furlough notices and potential closings due to these devastating cuts. Anyone who says the sequester won’t harm our families in Wisconsin and hurt our country’s economic growth is living with their heads in the sand.  “I urge the House leadership to bring us back into session. I am ready and prepared to work with my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, as long as it takes, so we can avoid this unnecessary and irresponsible budget tornado as soon as possible.”According to a report released by the White House earlier this week, Wisconsin communities would face the below consequences if the automatic spending cuts are not stopped and replaced:Teachers and Schools: Wisconsin will lose approximately $8.5 million in funding for primary and secondary education. In addition about 10,000 fewer students would be served and approximately 50 fewer schools would receive funding.Education for Children with Disabilities: Wisconsin will lose approximately $10.1 million in funds for teachers, aides, and staff who help children with disabilities.Work-Study Jobs: Around 550 fewer low income students in Wisconsin would receive aid to help them finance the costs of college and around 420 fewer students will get work-study jobs that help them pay for college.Head Start: Head Start and Early Head Start services would be eliminated for approximately 900 children in Wisconsin, reducing access to critical early education.Protections for Clean Air and Clean Water: Wisconsin would lose about $3,875,000 in environmental funding to ensure clean water and air quality, as well as prevent pollution from pesticides and hazardous waste. In addition, Wisconsin could lose another $1,479,000 in grants for fish and wildlife protection.Military Readiness: In Wisconsin, approximately 3,000 civilian Department of Defense employees would be furloughed, reducing gross pay by around $12.4 million in total. Army: Base operation funding would be cut by about $1 million in Wisconsin.Job Search Assistance to Help those in Wisconsin find Employment and Training: Wisconsin will lose about $661,000 in funding for job search assistance, referral, and placement, meaning around 23,120 fewer people will get the help and skills they need to find employment.Child Care: Up to 500 disadvantaged and vulnerable children could lose access to child care, which is also essential for working parents to hold down a job.Vaccines for Children: In Wisconsin around 2,540 fewer children will receive vaccines for diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, whooping cough, influenza, and Hepatitis B due to reduced funding for vaccinations of about $173,000.Public Health: Wisconsin will lose approximately $543,000 in funds to help upgrade its ability to respond to public health threats including infectious diseases, natural disasters, and biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological events. In addition, Wisconsin will lose about $1,390,000 in grants to help prevent and treat substance abuse, resulting in around 2,600 fewer admissions to substance abuse programs. And the Wisconsin Department of Health Services will lose about $108,000 resulting in around 2,700 fewer HIV tests.STOP Violence Against Women Program: Wisconsin could lose up to $120,000 in funds that provide services to victims of domestic violence, resulting in up to 500 fewer victims being served.Nutrition Assistance for Seniors: Wisconsin would lose approximately $653,000 in funds that provide meals for seniors.###',\n",

       "  'date': 'February 25, 2013',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON—Unless Congress takes action, in just four days the government will initiate $85 billion in automatic spending cuts that will severely impact Wisconsin schools, seniors and small businesses. Following a report released by the White House last night that highlighted the specific effects of these cuts on the Badger state, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) once again called on his colleagues in Washington to come to the table and work on a balanced plan to avoid this unnecessary crisis.“How many warnings will Washington need to force us to take action and avoid this unnecessary and irresponsible budget tornado? How many teachers will we need to layoff, how many more small businesses will struggle to obtain a loan, and how many seniors will need to go hungry for us to decide that the time for political posturing is over?” said Rep. Pocan. “Despite what others in Washington and Madison may say, the effects of these cuts are real and serious. Middle class families in Wisconsin do not deserve to have their economic security put at risk because some in Washington find it politically inconvenient to do their jobs.“I have joined my Democratic colleagues in the House to support a plan that would replace these automatic spending cuts with commonsense initiatives that will promote economic growth and reduce our deficit without unduly threatening the security of the neediest Wisconsin residents. I am ready and eager to work with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle on these and other solutions that will restore the security and certainty our families in Wisconsin need.”Previous reports on the effects of sequestration have shown that the across-the-board spending cuts would result in the loss of 2.14 million jobs nationally, including 36,000 jobs in Wisconsin, and loan guarantees to small businesses would be reduced by up to $900 million across the country.The new report indicates that Wisconsin communities would face the below consequences if the automatic spending cuts take place on Friday:Teachers and Schools: Wisconsin will lose approximately $8.5 million in funding for primary and secondary education. In addition about 10,000 fewer students would be served and approximately 50 fewer schools would receive funding.Education for Children with Disabilities: Wisconsin will lose approximately $10.1 million in funds for teachers, aides, and staff who help children with disabilities.Work-Study Jobs: Around 550 fewer low income students in Wisconsin would receive aid to help them finance the costs of college and around 420 fewer students will get work-study jobs that help them pay for college.Head Start: Head Start and Early Head Start services would be eliminated for approximately 900 children in Wisconsin, reducing access to critical early education.Protections for Clean Air and Clean Water: Wisconsin would lose about $3,875,000 in environmental funding to ensure clean water and air quality, as well as prevent pollution from pesticides and hazardous waste.

This bill provides much-needed military assistance to Ukraine to fight back and regain its territory, hopefully putting an end to this war without putting American boots on the ground. I’m glad Speaker Johnson finally allowed the House to take action on this critical funding on its own, and I was glad to vote in favor of the Ukraine Supplemental.\\xa0“Today’s votes also included billions of dollars in unconditional weapons for Israel. While the Israel Supplemental bill also included necessary funding for global humanitarian assistance as well as funding for the Iron Dome and other Israeli defense systems that rightly enable Israel to defend itself, I could not in good conscience vote for more offensive weapons to be given to Israel to be used in Gaza without any conditions attached. The devastation inflicted upon innocent civilians in Gaza is unjustifiable, and the United States cannot continue providing Prime Minister Netanyahu with a blank check to expand this conflict. Further arming Netanyahu and his extreme coalition could only lead us to a wider conflict in the Middle East. A ceasefire and freeing the hostages while also redoubling the efforts to achieve a two-state solution is the surest way toward peace in the region; more bombs to kill starving kids is not.”\\xa0Pocan also voted in favor of legislation to provide $8 billion to bolster security in the Indo-Pacific, including through security assistance to Taiwan.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Congressman Mark Pocan (WI-02), spoke on the House Floor about the ongoing war in Gaza after the Israeli military targeted a World Central Kitchen humanitarian aid convoy killing seven, including an American citizen. Pocan highlighted a letter he led, along with 55 of his colleagues, to President Biden and Secretary Blinken calling for future offensive arms transfers to Israel to be withheld until a full investigation into the World Central Kitchen airstrike has been completed and to continue withholding arms transfers if Israel fails to sufficiently mitigate civilian harm and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid.Click here to watch the full speech and find the transcript of Rep. Pocan’s remarks below.\\xa0Rep. Mark PocanApril 9, 2024Floor Remarks on the Ongoing War in Israel and GazaRemarks as DeliveredI’ve been attending town halls and meetings across my district over the last two weeks. Smaller communities in Wisconsin like Edgerton, Sauk City, Monroe, Mazomanie, and Darlington. Smaller communities with hard-working people with a strong work ethic and upper Midwestern values like fairness and compassion.And at those meetings, I’ve heard a common thread. They don’t like what they are seeing in Gaza and Israel. The vast majority recognize that the attack on October 7th was horrific, and Israel had a right to respond. But they didn’t have a right to collectively punish 2.3 million people stuck in Gaza.They know that 1,200 people are dead in Israel from the attack, and over 130 people are still being held by Hamas. But they also know that nearly 34,000 people are dead in Gaza, 70% of which are women and children – clearly not members of Hamas.They know that 2 million people have been displaced in Gaza, and the majority of the buildings and infrastructure have been demolished or damaged by Israeli bombs.They know that the people are dying of starvation because almost every entry point to Gaza is through Israel, and not enough supplies and aid are getting through. And, they understand that the United States is trying to help with aid, but we have to drop it from the air or bring it in by sea because our friend Israel won’t allow us to bring it in through easier, safer ways like by truck and transport.They know that aid workers are being killed – 200 plus to date – including some from Chef Jose Andres’s World Central Kitchen. The limited food, water, and supplies that are being let in have to be distributed, but aid workers are too often killed in the process of delivering humanitarian aid, making alleviating suffering even more difficult.And they don’t understand how we can both provide armaments and aid to the same area, as that doesn’t make sense to people with Midwestern sensibilities.They tell me it looks like punishment for being Palestinian. They tell me it appears Benjamin Netanyahu wants people to leave Gaza for good. They tell me it looks too much like what genocide would look like – and that concerns them greatly.And the bombings of the World Central Kitchen workers – the seemingly targeted and repeated bombings, despite the Israeli military knowing their location and purpose – has been one more step too far by Netanyahu’s government’s handling of this war.Enough is enough.The indiscriminate killing must stop. The aid must flow. The hostages must be released. A ceasefire must hold to protect every child in Gaza and Israel.The devastation has been severe, far more severe than it ever needed to be. The world would have understood a response going after Hamas killers. But the Netanyahu government has gone too far, way too far, in its response.That’s why I helped lead a letter, signed by 56 members of Congress, to the President, to stop any additional offensive arms transfers to Israel without a thorough investigation of the World Central Kitchen killings and a plan for aid and assistance to get to starving Palestinians.The United States has long supported two nations, existing side-by-side, in peace – a two-state solution. But Benjamin Netanyahu doesn’t support that reasoned path to peace. And that, along with his punishing innocent Palestinians while allegedly going after Hamas, has made it time to get a divorce from Benjamin Netanyahu.I support the overwhelming majority of Israelis who want peace. They want to live safely without bombs raining on them from extremists in Gaza. They too don’t like the direction and mistakes of the Netanyahu administration. And they want the hostages returned immediately.And the overwhelming majority of Palestinians want peace as well. They just want to live their lives with dignity and independence, as they should. But they need to be treated as equals with human rights, which too often they are not.I urge our government to do more to help distribute aid, utilizing great groups like the World Central Kitchen and UNRWA and others that are doing this work. And our government must stop supplying any offensive weapons or equipment that damages Gaza further, especially in regards to any invasion of Rafah.Let’s take this awful current situation and make some good come out of it. We need to double down on a two-state solution that recognizes the many, many good people of Israel and Palestine that want to live in peace.It is achievable. And the United States is crucial to that peace. That’s what I’m hearing in my district.I yield back.',\n",

       "  'date': 'April 5, 2024',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02), Jim McGovern (MA-02), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09) and 37 of their colleagues sent a letter to President Biden and Secretary of State Blinken asking them to withhold pending offensive weapons transfers to Israel after seven humanitarian aid workers from World Central Kitchen, including one American, were killed in an Israeli airstrike, and to place conditions on future weapons assistance.“We write to express our shared concern and outrage regarding the recent Israeli airstrike which killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers, including an American citizen,” the Members wrote. “In light of this incident, we strongly urge you to reconsider your recent decision to authorize the transfer of a new arms package to Israel and to withhold this and any future offensive arms transfers until a full investigation into the airstrike is completed. If this strike is found to have violated U.S. or international law, we urge you to continue withholding these transfers until those responsible are held accountable. We also urge you to withhold these transfers if Israel fails to sufficiently mitigate harm to innocent civilians in Gaza, including aid workers, and if it fails to facilitate – or arbitrarily denies or restricts – the transport and delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza.”“It is estimated that over 32,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of this war, nearly half of whom are children,” the Members continued. “While we appreciate your administration’s recent efforts to increase the delivery of desperately needed humanitarian aid to Gaza, these efforts will not be sufficient to meet the extraordinary need on the ground. The Israeli government’s restrictions on the flow of aid into Gaza, coupled with the death and grave harm that aid workers have faced during this war, are compounding this hunger crisis. Recent reports indicate that hundreds of aid trucks sit idle outside the Rafah border crossing due to Israel’s restrictions. And now over 200 aid workers have been killed since the start of the war. These attacks and deaths are having a chilling effect with the World Central Kitchen and other humanitarian groups now suspending their operations in Gaza. Until now, World Central Kitchen has provided more than 43 million meals to Palestinians in Gaza, lending support to 68 community kitchens throughout the territory and serving more than 170,000 hot meals each day. Its services are irreplaceable, and its absence will fuel the growing hunger crisis in Gaza.”“In light of the recent strike against aid workers and the ever-worsening humanitarian crisis, we believe it is unjustifiable to approve these weapons transfers,” the Members concluded. “We again strongly urge you to withhold any offensive weapons transfers until the investigation into the airstrike is concluded and, if it is found this strike violated U.S. or international law, those responsible are held accountable. And we again urge you to ensure that any future military assistance to Israel, including already authorized transfers, is subject to conditions to ensure it is used in compliance with U.S. and international law.”Click here to see the full text of the letter.The letter was signed by:\\xa0Pocan, Mark; McGovern, James; Schakowsky, Jan;\\xa0Adams, Alma; Balint, Becca; Barragán, Nanette; Beyer, Donald; Blumenauer, Earl; Bowman, Jamaal; Bush, Cori; Cárdenas, Tony; Carson, André; Casar, Greg; Castro, Joaquin; Chu, Judy; Dean, Madeleine; DeLauro, Rosa; DeSaulnier, Mark; Dingell, Debbie; Doggett, Lloyd; Escobar, Veronica; Eshoo, Anna; Garamendi, John; García, Jesús; Garcia, Robert; Garcia, Sylvia; Green, Al; Hayes, Jahana; Huffman, Jared; Jackson, Jonathan; Jackson Lee, Sheila; Jacobs, Sara; Jayapal, Pramila; Johnson, Henry; Khanna, Ro; Kildee, Daniel; Lee, Barbara; Lee, Summer; Lofgren, Zoe; McCollum, Betty; Mullin, Kevin; Norton, Eleanor; Ocasio-Cortez, Alexandria; Omar, Ilhan; Pelosi, Nancy; Pingree, Chellie; Pressley, Ayanna; Ramirez, Delia; Raskin, Jamie; Stansbury, Melanie; Takano, Mark; Thompson, Bennie; Tlaib, Rashida; Tonko, Paul; Velázquez, Nydia; Watson Coleman, Bonnie',\n",

These measures include expanding access to child care, keeping workers safe, and giving our troops a raise. Any inaction toward this bill could have shut down the government, allowing the GOP leadership to give us a bill that would have been worse, riddled with extreme priorities. House Democrats played the best hand with the cards we were dealt.\\xa0“I’m not supportive of some provisions in this bill, including a delay of additional funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). This is a continuation of the Administration’s current policy toward the agency which must be overturned. I support immediately providing much-needed funding toward the agency and will continue my work to do just that.”\\xa0By passing the bill, Democrats rejected many extreme Republican cuts and policy riders. Instead, this government funding package provides:$1 billion increase for child care and Head Start.$20 million increase for Title I education funding, rejecting Republican efforts to eliminate 224,000 teachers’ jobs.$14 million increase in funding for special education.Protects funding for the maximum Pell Grant at $7,395 per student.\\xa0$1.1 billion for Senior Nutrition Programs, which includes Meals on Wheels.Increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health, including for cancer and Alzheimer’s research.Provides 5.2% pay increase for servicemembers and increases the Basic Allowance for Housing by 5.4%.\\xa0$1 billion increase for climate change and resilience activities.Adds 12,000 more Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who assisted the United States.Includes $29.9 billion to support the reunification of migrant families cruelly separated at the southern border by the Trump administration.Removes numerous Republican policy riders including 10 that would have limited women’s access to reproductive health, 44 that attacked the rights of the LGBTQI+ community, and banned funding for President Biden’s executive orders to address the climate crisis.As a member of the Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for drafting all federal funding legislation, Rep. Pocan looks forward to Wisconsin – and Wisconsin’s 2nd Congressional District – receiving the funding it needs and deserves.This package includes the following funding bills: Defense; Financial Services and General Government; Homeland Security; Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies; Legislative Branch; and State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs.A detailed summary of the legislation is available here.A package containing six other appropriations bills for fiscal year 2024, including all of Rep.

While the violent attack by Hamas on the Israeli people was brutal, it has lessened, and the retaliation by Israel toward Hamas is in full swing.“My concern, however, is that the retaliation by Israel is less targeted at Hamas or Islamic Jihad, and more closely resembles a collective punishment against all Palestinians and others living in Gaza. From public comments to the sheer volume of bombs and areas targeted, this attack does not appear to be strategically targeting Hamas as originally stated.\"I join the many\\xa0humanitarian groups\\xa0working in Gaza in\\xa0calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities\\xa0towards civilians by all parties in this war. Both the overly broad retaliation of the Israeli government and the continued random missile fires of both Hamas and Islamic Jihad must stop.“Further, we must help\\xa0facilitate essential and life-saving assistance, including food, water, medical supplies and more to Gaza.\\xa0We must also do more to provide for humanitarian access to these supplies and corridors for people who want to leave troubled areas, and any hostages held by Hamas must be released immediately.“Additionally, the aid needed to help in Gaza from the United States must be robust.\\xa0While I appreciate the initial $100 million announced by President Biden in aid to Gaza and the West Bank, we all know much more is needed to help in the initial estimate of $3-5 billion that is necessary. As a supplemental funding bill for Ukraine, Israel, and more moves forward, we must ensure it includes robust funding for humanitarian aid for both Israel and the impoverished people of Gaza.“There is something that clearly links the people of both Israel and Palestine: there are way too many deaths of children that should never have occurred. This must stop, without excuse or hesitation.”',\n",

The five Water Defenders began to speak out against these steps last year, and in January 2023, were suddenly arrested and charged with a decades-old alleged crime. The Salvadoran Attorney General’s Office requested and obtained complete secrecy for the proceedings.

Instead, he and his Republican colleagues chose to engage in hostage-taking, refusing to raise the debt ceiling to avoid default unless paired with devastating cuts to essential government programs. While I am relieved the President and Democratic Leadership were able to walk back the worst of the Republicans’ demands, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I was unable to support this final agreement due to remaining unanswered questions.“This bill critically undercuts the appropriations process, one of the last processes in Washington where Democrats and Republicans work together. Severely restraining domestic spending while continuing to inflate unchecked defense spending for the Pentagon shows Republicans are not actually serious about addressing the deficit.\\xa0“With too many unanswered questions and unknown, undisclosed side deals, including a shortfall of $58 billion in promised domestic funding not explicitly guaranteed in the language of the bill for things like education, healthcare, and more, I could not, in good conscience, vote for this bill.\\xa0“In addition to my serious concerns about the impacts to the appropriations process and backroom deals, this bill expands SNAP work requirements for older Americans and threatens cash assistance for the lowest-income families, while simultaneously rescinding critical IRS investments intended to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. Moreover, this bill weakens key environmental and climate protections.\\xa0“While I am relieved that we will avoid an economic default, I remain steadfast that we never should have had to engage with an extreme MAGA Republican dominated caucus in hostage negotiations over Americans’ livelihoods to begin with. Looking forward, we should eliminate the unnecessary debt ceiling to avoid any question of the full faith and credit of the United States.”',\n",

This bipartisan legislation would administer a 0.5% cut to the budget of any office at the Pentagon that does not receive an audit for the first year of the bill\\'s enactment, then rises to 1.0% in subsequent years. The bill exempts funding for personnel, families, and military health care from these automatic cuts.\"We cannot justify continuing to increase the Pentagon budget when the agency cannot even successfully pass an audit,\" said Congressman Pocan. \"This bill will provide a powerful incentive to Pentagon leaders to get their fiscal house in order. DoD has a history of little accountability while pouring billions into weapons systems that just don\\'t work properly. It\\'s past time to rein in spending on ineffective programs and restore fiscal discipline to the Pentagon.\" \"The lack of accountability and transparency at the Pentagon is simply outrageous. Congress pours trillions of taxpayer dollars into the Pentagon, but we still have no clear idea how that money is being spent,\" said Congresswoman Lee. \"The Pentagon\\'s inability to responsibly manage billions of taxpayer dollars allocated every year is unacceptable. Our bipartisan coalition of Representatives Burgess, Pocan, and Biggs are committed to finally holding the Pentagon accountable to the American taxpayer.\"\"As stewards of taxpayer dollars, it is our responsibility to demand transparency and accountability from all government agencies, including the Department of Defense,\" said Rep. Burgess. \"It is unacceptable that the DoD has yet to complete a full financial audit, unlike other major agencies. While some progress has been made, more needs to be done to ensure that the DoD is fully compliant with the law. By incentivizing a full audit and reducing funding for unauditable departments, we can hold the DoD accountable and ensure proper oversight. Our duty to the American people requires no less.\" \"The Pentagon has been on a wild spending spree and it\\'s long past time to bring accountability and enhanced oversight over its spending habits,\" said Congressman Andy Biggs (R-AZ).

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.— U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Barbara Lee (CA-13), both co-founders and Co-Chairs of the Defense Spending Reduction Caucus and members of the House Appropriations Committee, sent a letter to House Armed Services Committee Chair Adam Smith today urging him and the committee to not pass a National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22 NDAA) that is larger than the level requested by President Biden earlier this year.\"At a time when the United States is withdrawing from wars abroad, we should be committed to cutting our defense spending now more than ever,\"Congressman Pocan said.\"The FY22 NDAA should absolutely be lower than current spending levels, and in no way should it be even a penny more than what the Commander-in-Chief requested or what the House Appropriations committee approved. The threats of today are different than those of years past and cannot be solved by military might alone. COVID-19 remains the greatest threat to our country and the world, yet only a small percentage is vaccinated against this deadly disease. Climate change is destroying neighborhoods in the blink of an eye. We should be fighting these very real threats instead of authorizing more than what was requested to fund the slush funds of defense contractors.\"\"As we watch the tragic humanitarian situation unfold in Afghanistan, we must reevaluate our priorities when it comes to cutting the bloated defense budget that has enabled 40 years of blank check wars around the globe,\" said Congresswoman Barbara Lee. \"Despite trillions of dollars poured into our endless military spending, this budget has failed to meet the greatest threats that our nation and our world faces today, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, and the needs of 140 million people living in poverty. Now is the time to shift our investments away from endless wars and toward addressing human needs.\"Click here to read the letter as delivered. The Honorable Adam SmithChairmanHouse Armed Services Committee2216 Rayburn House Office BuildingWashington, D.C. 20515Dear Chairman Smith:We request that the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22 NDAA) reported by the House Armed Services Committee not exceed an authorization level larger than the level requested in President Biden\\'s budget submission to Congress or the amount of appropriations already approved by the House Appropriations Committee.We are aware that the Senate Armed Services Committee recently passed an FY22 NDAA that is $25 billion larger than what the Commander-in-Chief requested. This number is above and beyond the more than one percent increase in funding requested by President Biden and approved by the House Appropriations Committee. Surpassing the President\\'s request by such a large and unwarranted amount should not be the starting position of the House Armed Services Committee, particularly when current defense spending levels should already be reduced.America spends more on its military than the next 11 largest defense-spending nations combined. This will remain true if the President\\'s budget request were enacted, and the ratio will only increase under the Senate\\'s proposal. At a time when America\\'s largest national security threat is a global pandemic, our spending priorities should embrace efforts such as increased COVID vaccination efforts abroad instead of continually increased military spending – especially during a period of military withdrawal from foreign wars.Thank you for your consideration of this request. We look forward to working with you to produce an FY22 NDAA that is no larger than President Biden\\'s budget request and that is aligned with the priorities of the House Democratic Caucus.Sincerely,Mark PocanMember of Congress  Barbara LeeMember of CongressJake AuchinclossMember of CongressKaren BassMember of CongressJamaal BowmanMember of CongressSteve CohenMember of CongressDanny K.

       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI—As the nation mourns the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless other Black Americans at the hands of police violence, Congressman Mark Pocan (D-WI) is introducing the Police Training and Accountability Act. The bill would establish a national training standard for all law enforcement officers and a Civilian-Law Enforcement Bill of Rights for anyone having contact with law enforcement. A civilian commission would be named to set standards of training for police, to bridge the wide gaps of what training for law enforcement looks like nationwide. The act would require federal funding to police departments to be contingent on these standards being met. \"The police violence we\\'ve seen in the past month is tolerated long before it is called out, and the people of this country are fed up with systemic racial injustice constantly being met with inaction,\" said Congressman Pocan. \"Everyone needs to believe that all law enforcement officers have met national standardized requirements for training and civilian interaction. Federal dollars should not go to police that communities simply do not trust. From de-escalation to use of lethal force, police nationwide must meet new standards before they receive additional funding from the federal government.\"The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (Byrne JAG), is the largest source of federal funds for state and local law enforcement agencies—$547.2 million were appropriated for the program in FY2020. The Police Accountability and Funding Act would require those federal funds to be conditional on police departments meeting the training requirement and standards created by a civilian commission. Those requirements must include, at minimum, standards for: a minimum level of education attainment and training hours, use of force, use of lethal force, implicit bias, conflict resolution, mediation, and de-escalation practices, pursuit, video technology, stop and search procedures, and intervention programs.The bill would also require police departments to adhere to a Civilian-Law Enforcement Bill of Rights prior to receiving any Byrne JAG funding.\"Communities should not only understand what to expect from interactions with law enforcement, but they should have a voice in setting those expectations,\" continued Pocan. \"A Civilian-Law Enforcement Bill of Rights lays out national standards and expectations for anyone in contact with law enforcement, no matter where they live in our country. We need equal enforcement of the law for everyone.\"\"From Florida to Washington, Maine to California, there should be a common standard for law enforcement. We cannot continue to fund new initiatives for police departments to improve while the same systemic problems continue,\" said Pocan. \"Police departments nationwide must use existing funds to meet these new standards. Law enforcement must be held accountable to the standards of the community they are tasked to serve and protect. Anything less is a continuation of injustice.\"See the full text of the bill here.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'MADISON, WI—Representatives Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Barbara Lee (D-CA) led a group of 29 Democrats demanding that this year\\'s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorize a level of spending below last year\\'s budget, in a letter to House Armed Services Committee (HASC) leadership this morning.Since the start of the Trump administration, defense spending has increased every year—over $100 billion, almost 20%, in three years. Now more than ever, in the middle of a global pandemic, we cannot allow this ballooning spending to be directed towards this president\\'s warmongering. Over 90,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, and we must focus our spending efforts on the expansion of testing, contact tracing, treatment, vaccine development and relief for the people of this country. Last year\\'s NDAA authorized $738 billion in defense spending for FY20, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) got 1/90th of that: less than $8 billion.\"We are facing a crisis in this country and billions of dollars in defense spending increases won\\'t solve it,\" said Congressman Pocan. \"Year after year, we see taxpayer dollars line the pocket of defense contractors instead of supporting the American public. The enemy we\\'re fighting right now is COVID-19, so our sole focus should be on expanding testing, tracing and treatment, funding towards vaccine development, and relief for the American people. Increasing defense spending now would be a slap in the face to the families of over 90,000 Americans that have died from this virus.\"\"Year after year, the Pentagon budget has inflated to historic levels while the vital needs of everyday people are left unmet,\" said Congresswoman Lee. \"The COVID pandemic has laid bare how America has failed to make its budgets reflect the real needs of our everyday families. It\\'s long past time that we address our bloated military budget and retarget resources towards policies and programs that matter the most for keeping us safe, healthy, and secure.\"Last year\\'s House NDAA passed out of the House of Representatives in July with zero Republican votes and eight Democratic \"NO\" votes—both Pocan and Lee voted against last year\\'s defense spending increase. Republicans withstanding, 19 Democrats would need to vote \"NO\" this year for the bill to fail. 29 Democrats signed this letter.This letter was co-signed by Representatives Blumenauer (D-OE), Cohen (D-TN), DeFazio (D-OR), DeGette (D-CO), Espaillat (D-NY), Evans (D-PA), J.

EsperSecretary of DefenseUnited States of America1000 Defense PentagonWashington, DC  20301Dear Secretary Esper:Global pandemics know no boundaries, neither should responses to them.  For that reason, I write to inquire about the Department of Defense's (DOD) preparedness and response planning for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Domestically, America's response to COVID-19 has been disturbing.  The severity of the threat has been underestimated and understated from the beginning; and, as a result, the Administration has proven incapable of developing a coherent strategy to combat the disease.In times such as this, it is imperative that every American receive the care they need.  That is especially true for our servicemembers who will inevitably be called upon to assist in the global response to COVID-19.  Unfortunately, however, I have been told that there are members of our military stationed in Afghanistan who have flu-like symptoms, have tested negative for the flu, and are being denied testing for COVID-19.  If true, this is deeply distressing and must be remedied immediately.  Senior military officials who travel from installation to installation may be unknowingly contributing to the spread of COVID-19 among servicemembers serving in some of the most vulnerable regions of the world.Therefore, I wish to know the following:Does DOD have COVID-19 tests?If so, how many?How many tests can DOD labs process per day?Can any servicemember who wishes to be tested for COVID-19 receive a test?Has any servicemember who has requested a test for COVID-19 been denied a test for COVID-19?If so, how many?How many COVID-19 tests are available to servicemembers stationed abroad?How many COVID-19 tests are available to servicemembers stationed in Afghanistan?How many servicemembers currently have COVID-19?How many servicemembers have been quarantined because of COVID-19 concerns or exposure?Because sample specimens taken as part of COVID-19 test collections typically degrade beyond many labs' testing capabilities within 72 hours, how many servicemembers would currently be unable to have a collected sample tested for COVID-19 within 72 hours of collection?What new Defense-wide procedures have you implemented in response to COVID-19?What is the implementation date for each of the procedures listed in response to the previous question?Is DOD concerned about any possible drug shortage during this COVID-19 outbreak?If so, what steps are being taken to address those concerns?What medical supplies and medical care capacity (such as medical care facilities, hospitals, isolation units, intensive care beds, etc.) for servicemembers do you anticipate will be most stressed during this pandemic?Finally, how much additional funding do you anticipate requesting from Congress in order to adequately respond to threats posed by COVID-19?I appreciate your immediate attention to this matter, and encourage you to publicly announce to all servicemembers, including their families, the COVID-19 procedures you have established and the level of care they can expect to receive.  Given the seriousness of this inquiry, I request a response to the questions contained in this letter in no less than 48 hours.\",\n",

This bill is a chance for us to make it right,\" saidSchatz.\"Veterans who honorably served our nation should not have to fight for their benefits,\" said Gillibrand. \"The Restore Honor to Service Members Act would clear discriminatory discharges they received on their records due solely to their sexual orientation.

However, both you and President Trump are refusing to accept the facts and are instead twisting the narrative for political purposes to rally the Republican base. President Trump is resorting to desperate, last ditch efforts to shore up his political support after he couldn\\'t get Congress to fully fund his border wall request, much in the same way you sold out Wisconsin to Foxconn for nearly $4.5 billion after failing to fulfill your 2010 pledge to create 250,000 jobs in one, four year term. Failure seems to attract failure.\"President Trump is not sending troops to the southern border to stop the flow of drugs from Mexico. It is clear that his goal is to apprehend migrants, many of whom are children fleeing violence in their home countries. Sending members of the Wisconsin National Guard to militarize the border against unarmed men, women, and children is absurd. Further, you will cause undue harm to the families of Wisconsin National Guard members as your actions are only being done for political purposes.\"First, most drugs are not smuggled across the border by migrants that National Guard troops could apprehend. Second, if you truly wanted to solve Wisconsin\\'s opioid crisis, you should sign Wisconsin onto lawsuits like those that other states are leading against the nation\\'s top opioid manufacturers. Governor Walker, your support of President Trump\\'s plan for border security is wrong for Wisconsin and you should reverse course on this decision immediately.\"',\n",

Last week, the Chair of the House Intel Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, tried to spin Trump\\'s widely debunked wiretapping claims by releasing new unconfirmed information to the press concerning surveillance of associates to Trump. Yesterday, in an interview on FOX News Sunday with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Chris Wallace asked if Trump was ready to apologize regarding his accusations of wiretapping.The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board also didn\\'t mince words when it said, President Trump is damaging the presidency \"with his seemingly endless stream of exaggerations, evidence-free accusations, implausible denials and other falsehoods.\" In the interest of our national security and credibility as the leader of the free world, it is vital Trump is held accountable for these baseless accusations.In the letter, the Members of Congress state:\"As this investigation continues, we urge you and your Administration to follow a simple rule: tell the truth.

       "  'title': 'Comprehensive Legislation Would Safeguard Future Elections from Cyber-Attacks',\n",
       "  'date': 'March 16, 2017',\n",
       "  'text': 'Washington, D.C. – In light of the widespread Russian interference in the 2016 election, U.S. Reps. Mark Pocan (D-WI), Keith Ellison (D-MN), and Hank Johnson (D-GA) today introduced the Securing America\\'s Future Elections (SAFE) Act. This comprehensive legislation would safeguard our elections from future foreign cyber-attacks and interference by permanently classifying the integrity and security of our elections as a key component of critical infrastructure. This important classification would place elections systems in the same category as other critical infrastructure including the power grid, the banking system, and other utilities. The SAFE Act also addresses election standards to protect against cyber-threats, better voting machines that provide paper ballots, and random audits of ballots to thwart interference.As we continue to uncover the extent of Russia\\'s aggressive cyber tactics against the 2016 election and potential Russian ties to the Trump Administration, Republicans on the House Administration Committee voted to shut down the Election Administration Committee (EAC), the federal agency created to help states improve their election systems and security. The EAC is the most well-equipped agency to deal with election technology issues, such as software patches, for voting machines from private vendors. Eliminating this crucial agency would create an easily exploitable opportunity to hackers. The SAFE Act would reauthorize the EAC for a period of 10 years and require a random audit of precincts/wards in each state to ensure there are no discrepancies between paper ballots and electronic ballots.\"We must make sure the widespread Russian hacking and interference in the 2016 election never happens again,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"That\\'s why we are introducing this comprehensive approach to secure our election process from start to finish. By making our elections a top national security priority, we can ensure cybersecurity standards for voting systems are upgraded and require paper ballots with all electronic voting machines. One thing Democrats and Republicans should agree on is that we should be doing everything in our power to guarantee the sovereignty of our county and the integrity of our elections. This bill will do just that.\"\"Few things are as critical as the integrity of our elections, which is why we must protect one of our most sacred institutions from foreign powers and domestic hackers who seek to undermine and influence our democratic process,\" said Rep. Keith Ellison. \"The SAFE Act makes our elections a top national security priority, creates cybersecurity standards to protect our voting systems, and ensures accountability to voters. The American people must have full confidence that their votes are protected and counted. Russia nor any other country should be able to interfere in our elections ever again, which is why we must pass the SAFE Act.\"\"Recent reports documenting an alleged data breach at Georgia\\'s Center For Elections Systems – involving as much as 7.5 million voter records – serve as a stark reminder of the vulnerability of our election infrastructure,\" said Rep. Hank Johnson. \"As a fundamental tenet of our democracy, our voting systems are a matter of national security and we must make sure they are not compromised or disrupted by outside parties. Expressing Congress\\' support to designate our voting systems as critical infrastructure will encourage the Department of Homeland Security and the states to better coordinate, engage, and share resources that will improve the security of our electoral process. The SAFE Act will help ensure the security of our voting systems and preserve public faith in the integrity of our electoral process.\"The SAFE Act would: 1. Permanently classify the security and integrity of our elections as essential to the United States\\' national security interests and allow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to designate election infrastructure as critical infrastructure. This includes storage facilities, polling places, vote tabulation locations, voter databases, voting machines, and other systems that manage the election process.  This important classification would place elections systems in the same category as other critical infrastructure including the power grid, the banking system, and other utilities.2. Authorize the necessary funding for upgrading cybersecurity standards of voting systems, including the software used to operate such systems, and to ensure the security of the manufacturing processes for such components through collaboration with the National Institute for Standards in Technology (NIST) and the Department of Homeland Security. The bill will also ensure cybersecurity for all voter registration databases.3. Require NIST and DHS to create basic cybersecurity standards for private companies contracted to work on elections systems in the US.4. Require all electronic voting machines to have a corresponding paper ballot. The EAC would be required to randomly audit 5% of wards/precincts in each state to ensure that there are no discrepancies between paper ballots and electronic ballots.5. Reauthorize the EAC (Election Assistance Commission) for a period of 10 years. The EAC is the most well-equipped agency to deal with election technology issues, such as software patches, for voting machines from private vendors. Eliminating this crucial agency would create an easily exploitable opportunity to hackers. 6. Require the DHS to conduct a review of elections systems yearly beginning in 2018.',\n",

The shooting claimed the lives of 49 people as they celebrated Pride Month, making it the largest mass shooting in our nation’s history.“As we grapple with the horrific events that took place yesterday morning in Orlando, my thoughts are with the families of the victims and everyone affected during Pride Month. The targeting of the LGBT individuals in this heinous act of violence has reignited many fears and uncertainty in our community. As a country, we must stand together to denounce bigotry and hatred and embrace love and acceptance.“President Barack Obama declared this ‘an act of terror and an act of hate,’ an action perpetrated with a military-style assault weapon. Across the country people are asking themselves what they can do to help and what can be done to prevent such a devastating event from happening again.“As a Member of Congress I contemplated these thoughts as well, ultimately coming to the conclusion that Congress won't do a thing about any of these issues again this week. In fact, all too often actions and language here in Congress and on the campaign trail actually exacerbate would-be terrorists. And actions even on the Floor of the House of Representatives all too often reinforce the hate of some people. Unfortunately, this body is too chicken to address the epidemic of military-style assault weapons because that would upset the gun manufacturers and special interests.“In the end all we will do is have yet another moment of silence, rather than a moment of action. That disrespects the lives of the people who were killed not just yesterday, but every day by gun violence.

The legislation would help service members discharged solely due to their sexual orientation correct their military records to reflect their honorable service and reinstate the benefits they earned. \"We have a sacred commitment to every American who serves in our military.  But for the 100,000 brave Americans who were forced out for being gay, we have failed to honor that commitment,\" said Senator Schatz. \"The Restore Honor to Service Members Act would give these veterans a chance to correct their military records—to remove an unwarranted discharge that was given to them for no other reason than being gay.  It would remove the mark of shame they carry, give them access to benefits, and finally give them the respect and honor they rightly deserve.\"\"As we approach Veterans Day, it\\'s important to remember the sacrifices our veterans have made for our country,\" said Rep. Pocan, co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus. \"This includes the selfless service of more than 100,000 veterans who were discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation.

Love is not dishonorable.\"Since World War II, more than 100,000 Americans are estimated to have been discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation.  Those forced out of the military may have left with discharge statuses of \"other than honorable,\" \"general discharge\" or \"dishonorable,\" depending on the circumstances.  As a consequence, many of these service members may be disqualified from accessing certain benefits that they earned and are entitled to, and may not be able to claim veteran status.  The consequences of a negative discharge also include preventing some veterans from voting or making it more difficult for them to acquire civilian employment.  The legislation is supported by Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, VoteVets.org, OutServe-SLDN, the Human Rights Campaign, American Veterans for Equal Rights, Lambda Legal, Swords to Plowshares, the American Bar Association, Universal Unitarian Association, and the American Humanist Association.In addition to Representatives Pocan and Rangel, The Restore Honor to Service Members Act has 109 cosponsors, including 4 Republicans, in the House and 37 cosponsors in the Senate.# # #',\n",

What\\'s clear is that ensuring Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon is paramount to the safety and security of the Middle East and the global community. Decades of sanctions have not prevented Iran from pursuing nuclear capabilities, but with this diplomatic agreement I firmly believe we now have the opportunity to verifiably prevent a nuclear Iran by supporting and implementing this deal.\"This agreement effectively halts the Iranian Nuclear Program, and provides unprecedented access to monitor Iran\\'s nuclear sites. Ninety-eight percent of Iran\\'s enriched uranium stockpile will be removed and 13,000 centrifuges used in the production of nuclear material will be shut down and placed in storage. There will be strict limits placed on research, development and testing of advanced nuclear technology for the next ten years. After this initial period Iran will still be subjected to restrictions limiting enrichment to a level consistent with a peaceful nuclear program.\"Some of these transparency measures will last for decades, but the IAEA inspections are permanent giving the U.S. an unparalleled understanding of Iran\\'s nuclear program. If in the decades to come Iran tries to build a nuclear weapon we will be better prepared to detect and respond to this threat. If Congress strikes down this deal it could only hasten Iran\\'s ability to obtain a nuclear weapon and our global partners, including China and Russia, may have no reason to continue international sanctions. This agreement is based on stringent accountability measures to ensure Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.\"It took years of difficult diplomatic negotiations to reach this deal and I will actively work to ensure my colleagues stand with the President and other world leaders who have signed onto this historic agreement.\"',\n",

Seeking redress for them is not only the right thing to do but also will correct historical injustice.\"\"From the repeal of ‘Don\\'t Ask, Don\\'t Tell\\' to the Supreme Court\\'s historic ruling on marriage equality, we have made great strides in the fight to end discrimination.  But there is still more work to be done to protect and promote full equality and ensure we help right our past wrongs,\" said Senator Schatz.  \"Today, thousands of brave men and women who served our country are still denied the benefits and honorable service record they deserve.  It\\'s long past time we honor our commitment to all our service members and finally restore the dignity of gay and lesbian veterans who were unjustly discharged from our military.\"\"The Restore Honor to Service Members Act will help streamline the process for veterans to clear their records of discriminatory discharges,\" said Senator Gillibrand. \"Veterans who honorably serve our nation should not be defending themselves against unwarranted punishment based solely on sexual orientation. Our service members deserve to receive the recognition they earned for their sacrifice and courage.\"Since World War II, more than 100,000 Americans are estimated to have been discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation.  Those forced out of the military may have left with discharge statuses of \"other than honorable,\" \"general discharge\" or \"dishonorable,\" depending on the circumstances.  As a consequence, many of these service members may be disqualified from accessing certain benefits that they earned and are entitled to, and may not be able to claim veteran status.  The consequences of a negative discharge also include preventing some veterans from voting or making it more difficult for them to acquire civilian employment.   The legislation is supported by Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, VoteVets.org, OutServe-SLDN, the Human Rights Campaign, American Veterans for Equal Rights, Lambda Legal, Swords to Plowshares, the American Bar Association, Universal Unitarian Association, and the American Humanist Association. In addition to Representatives Pocan and Rangel, The Restore Honor to Service Members Act has 97 cosponsors and has bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. The bill is also cosponsored in the Senate by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawai\\'i), Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Al Franken (D-Minn.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). ###',\n",

       "  'text': 'Image    Falls Church, Virginia – The nationwide Circle of Friends for American Veterans (COFAV) recognized Congressman Mark Pocan today for his affirmation of its Veterans\\' Bill of Rights. Congressman Pocan readily affirmed the Veterans\\' Bill of Rights (VBOR) and plans to emphasize it in his work in the House of Representatives. He has affirmed through the VBOR that1) Veterans are a top priority; 2) He supports reducing the wait time on disability claims from the current 202 day average to 125; 3) The VA should negotiate for its procurement services; and 4) The VA should collect all possible insurance claims owed it.\"We must take a holistic approach to the treatment of those men and women who take on the extraordinary responsibility of defending our nation.\" Said Rep. Mark Pocan, \"Paying for our veterans\\' health care needs is part of the cost of war and we must fully fund efforts to provide veterans with the support they have earned defending our nation. I am extremely grateful to the servicemen and women who have dedicated their lives and made countless sacrifices to protect our country.\"The challenges facing our country\\'s nearly 22 million veterans are many. There are almost 100,000 homeless veterans, nearly 700,000 cases of PTSD & TBI, and 22 veteran suicides each day. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association one half of all veterans returning from a war zone suffer from chronic pain.The VA can gain literally billions of dollars in new revenue to provide services, without a dollar in new costs for taxpayers, by merely filling out the required paperwork on procurement and insurance claims. The services that can be expanded at zero cost include housing for 20,000 homeless veterans, and new dental procedures for over 300,000 veterans.Congressman Mark Pocan is committed to ensuring that veterans get the benefits they have earned. Since Congress first convened in January, he has introduced legislation focused on solving the issues veterans face, including the Putting our Veterans Back to Work Act of 2015 and the Veterans Access to Hearing Health Act of 2015. Congressman Pocan has proven that as a Representative for Wisconsin\\'s Second District he is ready and willing to stand up for America\\'s Veterans.Since 1993, The Circle of Friends for American Veterans has harnessed the power of the media to rally public support on behalf of American Veterans. COFAV has sponsored 196 programs and forums, with well over 100 Members of Congress speaking at its events. The Circle of Friends for American Veterans has supported local homeless veteran transitional facilities by organizing and conducting programs for public support in their local areas, as well as through earned media.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today criticized House Republicans for blocking consideration of his amendment to H.R.185 – Regulatory Accountability Act of 2015 which would protect America\\'s servicemembers and their families from predatory lending practices.  Pocan\\'s amendment would empower the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to use regulations within the Military Lending Act (MLA) to prevent disreputable lenders from charging service men and women excessive interest rates.\"Predatory lending harms the morale of troops and their families and undermines military readiness,\" said Rep. Mark Pocan. \"It\\'s shameful Republicans prevented the House from having a full and open debate on this important issue.  Instead they chose to protect predatory lenders and their tactics over protecting our men and women in uniform and their financial livelihoods.\"Congress passed the Military Lending Act in 2006 - to protect servicemembers from abusive predatory lending practices. However, the law left open many \"loopholes\" allowing lenders to continue to peddle some high-interest credit products. The Military Lending Act caps interest rates for military families at 36 percent. However, the limit only applies to three specific financial products: payday loans up to $2,500, auto title loans and tax refund anticipation loans. Some unscrupulous lenders responded by changing their products to fall outside the regulations, allowing many of the predatory lending practices to continue.\"We protect our service men and women with the equipment they need when they go into battle, so it\\'s important to make sure we protect them from predatory lending here at home,\" continued Rep. Pocan.  \"This amendment was a step in the right direction, but thanks to House Republicans, predatory lenders will be able to continue to exploit loopholes in the law and take advantage of our servicemembers and their families. It\\'s necessary to ensure regulators can continue to keep pace with industry practices in order to protect military personnel from this type of predatory lending.\"The amendment would allow the DoD and the Obama administration to move forward on proposed regulations to expand servicemember protections in the Military Lending Act.In a new report, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau said, \"The products that have been marketed and extended to servicemembers while the current Military Lending Act regulations have been in place underscore the limitations of those regulations in protecting servicemembers and their families across the credit marketplace.\"###',\n",

But there is debate about what this will actually do for the region and whether it will lead to war. This $500 million dollar down payment will only further entangle us in a part of the world most Americans want us out of.\"It\\'s important to remember how we got into this mess. Bad intelligence and deception from the Bush Administration led us to – years of war in Iraq – more than 4,000 lives lost – more than $1.7 trillion spent already – and more to come as we continue to care for our men and women in uniform when they return home.\"That is why Congress needs to have a standalone debate and vote on war authorization. After 150 airstrikes already – it\\'s hard to say it\\'s not a war. When you have over a thousand troops already on the ground – it\\'s hard to say it\\'s not a war. When the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says even more troops may be needed – it\\'s hard to say it\\'s not a war. The Constitution makes clear that Congress has a voice in matters of war.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Charlie Rangel (NY-13), lead sponsors of the bipartisan “Restore Honor to Service Members Act,” today applauded the introduction of this bill in the U.S. Senate by Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). The “Restore Honor to Service Members Act,” which Pocan and Rangel introduced in the House in July, would instill the repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” into law and ensure that gay and lesbian veterans who were discharged from the military because of their sexual orientation receive the honor and recognition they deserve. A statement from Pocan and Rangel is below:“We applaud Senators Schatz and Gillibrand for introducing the “Restore Honor to Service Members Act” in the Senate and standing up for our gay and lesbian veterans. This bill would close the book on “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” and provide tens of thousands of gay veterans, who selflessly risked their lives for our nation. Our bill already has the support of more than 140 House members, and we look forward to working with Senators Schatz and Gillibrand to ensure it can pass Congress and get to the President’s desk.”The “Restore Honor to Service Members Act” is about more than upgrading a piece of paper. Since World War II to the repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” in 2011, approximately 114,000 service members were discharged because of their sexual orientation. Every form of discharge previously given out prior to the repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” carries with it consequences that can follow a service member for his or her entire life. While the characterization of the discharges varied, many members received discharges that were classified as\"other than honorable\" or \"dishonorable\", particularly prior to the implementation of the “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy in 1993.  In many states, a dishonorable discharge is treated as a felony, and service members receiving a \"general discharge\", a lesser offense, can encounter grave difficulties acquiring civilian employment. All were barred from reenlisting in the military. Depending on the discharge received, service members may also be blocked from voting, unemployment benefits, participating in the GI Bill or receiving veteran benefits such as health care, VA disability, and ceremonial burial rights at military cemeteries. The “Restore Honor to Service Members Act,” turns the current broad review policy outlined in a memo from the Under Secretary of Defense into clear and settled law. It ensures all services members who were previously discharged because of their sexual orientation receive a timely, consistent and transparent review of their records so that gay veterans who served honorably have their records rightfully upgraded to honorable.###',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today became an original co-sponsor of the bipartisan and bicameral USA FREEDOM Act that would rein in the National Security Agency’s (NSA) blanket surveillance policies and protect the privacy rights of all Americans. The legislation, which is sponsored in the House by fellow Wisconsinite and Patriot Act author Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (WI-05), would reform the Patriot Act by ensuring greater transparency and oversight over domestic surveillance programs and increasing the safeguards meant to protect the privacy of U.S. citizens.   “We fight a futile battle to protect our liberties from outside if we cannot protect them from within,” Pocan said. “While ensuring our national security must remain our top priority, Wisconsinites are rightfully concerned that the NSA’s overreach threaten their constitutional right to privacy. The USA FREEDOM Act takes important steps to reinstitute the proper balance between security and liberty, and I thank my Wisconsin colleague Congressman Sensenbrenner for his leadership on this effort.”    Earlier this year, Pocan voted for the Amash/Conyers amendment to the defense funding bill that would have restricted the NSA’s ability to use the Patriot Act to conduct blanket surveillance on Americans not under investigation.A summary of the major provisions of the USA FREEDOM Act is below:End bulk collection of Americans’ communications records• The USA Freedom Act ends bulk collection under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. • The bill would strengthen the prohibition on \"reverse targeting\" of Americans—that is, targeting a foreigner with the goal of obtaining communications involving an American.• The bill requires the government to more aggressively filter and discard information about Americans accidentally collected through PRISM and related programs.Reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court• The USA Freedom Act creates an Office of the Special Advocate (OSA) tasked with promoting privacy interests before the FISA court’s closed proceedings. The OSA will have the authority to appeal decisions of the FISA court.• The bill creates new and more robust reporting requirements to ensure that Congress is aware of actions by the FISC and intelligence community as a whole.• The bill would grant the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight  Board subpoena authority to investigate issues related to privacy and national security.Increase Transparency• The USA Freedom Act would end secret laws by requiring the Attorney General to publicly disclose all FISC decisions issued after July 10, 2003 that contain a significant construction or interpretation of law. • Under the bill, Internet and telecom companies would be allowed to publicly report an estimate of (1) the number of FISA orders and national security letters received, (2) the number of such orders and letters complied with, and (3) the number of users or accounts on whom information was demanded under the orders and letters.• The bill would require the government to make annual or semiannual public reports estimating the total number of individuals and U.S. persons that were subject to FISA orders authorizing electronic surveillance, pen/trap devices, and access to business records.National Security Letters• The USA Freedom Act adopts a single standard for Section 215 and NSL protection to ensure the Administration doesn’t use different authorities to support bulk collection.  It also adds a sunset date to NSLs requiring that Congress reauthorize the government’s authority thereby ensuring proper congressional review.###',\n",

We need to engage the international community to find the appropriate response to the use of chemical weapons, and to do so will require a much broader discussion with all proper options given full consideration.

Mark Pocan (WI-02) today released the following statement on the reported use of chemical weapons in Syria and the rumors of a military strike by the United States:“The use of chemical weapons is a reprehensible action. However, before any military action is taken by the United States, Congress should have a robust and thorough debate on the nation’s appropriate response. Any decision to engage in a military response must be done in consultation with and approval of Congress.“I strongly urge the President to call Congress into session if he is serious about a military response to the civil war in Syria.

Mark Pocan (WI-02) today issued the following statement after voting to restrict the National Security Agency’s (NSA) ability to use the Patriot Act to conduct blanket surveillance on Americans not under investigation. The bipartisan measure was introduced as an amendment to the defense funding bill under consideration by the House this week.“The NSA’s invasive, but unfortunately legal, surveillance tactics are the exact type of government overreach Russ Feingold warned of when the Patriot Act was passed into law,” said Pocan. “While Americans understand that sacrifices must sometimes be made in the name of national security, it is against our country’s principles to unreasonably and excessively infringe on the right to privacy. Allowing the NSA to continue to freely conduct blanket surveillance measures creates an environment where any of our liberties could be up for grabs if the executive branch deems it appropriate. It is past time Congress put an end to these intrusive and secret practices, and I will continue to fight to ensure we can once again restore the necessary balance between privacy and security.”###',\n",

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON—U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) today introduced an amendment to the Department of Defense funding bill to make key investments in clean energy technologies that are critical to current and future military missions. Pocan’s efforts would support research and development to improve the safety of advanced batteries, and specifically lithium ion batteries, required for many of the Navy’s new capabilities. Lithium ion batteries, which contain no toxic chemicals, have up to three times the performance capabilities of other battery products.After securing commitments from committee leadership on the House floor to continue to work on ways to support these vital new technologies, Pocan withdrew his provision. “Investing in clean energy technologies is good environmental policy, good economic policy, and good national security policy,” Pocan said. “Advanced batteries such as those used by the Navy are not only more efficient and powerful, they also produce high quality American jobs, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and improve our abilities to respond to emerging threats,” Pocan said. “By supporting further research into these new advancements, we can ensure these technologies are as safe and effective as possible.”Many of the Navy’s newest systems require the type of increased energy capacities that lithium ion batteries provide. But current lithium-ion batteries can cause violent fires with extreme smoke and high temperatures that are potentially catastrophic, especially on ships. While scientists have advanced new technologies that can greatly increase the safety of these batteries, they require additional research, development and testing. Pocan’s provision would provide the necessary support to promote the development of more effective and safe advanced batteries.',\n",

Instead, he and his Republican colleagues chose to engage in hostage-taking, refusing to raise the debt ceiling to avoid default unless paired with devastating cuts to essential government programs. While I am relieved the President and Democratic Leadership were able to walk back the worst of the Republicans’ demands, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I was unable to support this final agreement due to remaining unanswered questions.“This bill critically undercuts the appropriations process, one of the last processes in Washington where Democrats and Republicans work together. Severely restraining domestic spending while continuing to inflate unchecked defense spending for the Pentagon shows Republicans are not actually serious about addressing the deficit.\\xa0“With too many unanswered questions and unknown, undisclosed side deals, including a shortfall of $58 billion in promised domestic funding not explicitly guaranteed in the language of the bill for things like education, healthcare, and more, I could not, in good conscience, vote for this bill.\\xa0“In addition to my serious concerns about the impacts to the appropriations process and backroom deals, this bill expands SNAP work requirements for older Americans and threatens cash assistance for the lowest-income families, while simultaneously rescinding critical IRS investments intended to crack down on wealthy tax cheats. Moreover, this bill weakens key environmental and climate protections.\\xa0“While I am relieved that we will avoid an economic default, I remain steadfast that we never should have had to engage with an extreme MAGA Republican dominated caucus in hostage negotiations over Americans’ livelihoods to begin with. Looking forward, we should eliminate the unnecessary debt ceiling to avoid any question of the full faith and credit of the United States.”',\n",

It is one of the most popular and important services the government provides,\" Rep. Pocan said. \"These non-Medicare plans run by private insurers undermine traditional Medicare. They often leave patients without the benefits they need while overcharging the federal government for corporate profit. This bill eliminates any confusion about what is – and what is not – Medicare, and ensures this essential program will continue to serve seniors and other Americans for years to come.\"\"It\\'s time to call out ‘Medicare Advantage\\' for what it is: private insurance that profits by denying coverage and the name is being used to trick seniors into enrolling. That\\'s not right,\" said Rep. Khanna. \"This bill will end the scam by preventing private insurers from profiting off the Medicare brand. Our focus should be on strengthening and expanding real Medicare.\"\"Do not be fooled, Medicare Advantage is not Medicare. I am extremely concerned about the deceptive advertisements that Medicare Advantage plans are using to trick older Americans into signing up for plans that may not cover the care they need. Not only are Medicare Advantage plans denying requests for much-needed care, but they are also falsifying medical records to make seniors appear sicker than they are so the plans can line their own pockets with taxpayer dollars,\" said Rep. Schakowsky. \"The Save Medicare Act, which I am proud to introduce with Congressman Pocan and Congressman Khanna, will help us put an end to the false advertising and will show the American people that these plans are scams.\"\"So-called Medicare Advantage is neither Medicare nor an advantage,\" said Wendell Potter, President of the Center for Health and Democracy. \"It is simply another scheme by the insurance companies to line their pockets at the expense of consumers. I applaud Congressman Pocan and Congressman Khanna for introducing this vital legislation. The health care market is confusing for consumers and misleading branding like so-called Medicare Advantage just makes it worse.\"\"Medicare is a national treasure, delivering real value to millions of older adults and people with disabilities,\" Diane Archer, President of Just Care USA said. \"Corporate insurance plans too often lean on Medicare\\'s good name to mislead people into signing up with them. Rep. Pocan and Rep. Khanna\\'s bill would put an end to this practice.\"\"Signing up for the right Medicare coverage is a nightmare right now, a complex and tangled maze of choices,\" Alex Lawson, Executive Director of Social Security Works said. \"The real problem is that a bunch of these choices aren\\'t Medicare at all. They are private insurance companies preying on seniors and people with disabilities. Unlike actual Medicare, these plans deny and delay care — because that\\'s what for-profit insurance always does. These corporate insurance plans should not be able to lie about who and what they are by calling themselves Medicare anything.\" \"Private health insurers drive up costs and deny care to people who need it, and calling what they\\'re up to ‘Medicare Advantage\\' doesn\\'t change that fact,\" People\\'s Action Director Sulma Arias said. \"This bill by Reps. Pocan, Khanna, and Schakowsky will stop these scams. The people organizing through our Our Health Care for All campaign are proud to support the Save Medicare Act. We need our elected officials to focus on expanding real Medicare to everyone, not lending its branding to greedy corporations.\"According to a New York Times article published in October, \"8 of the 10 largest Medicare Advantage insurers – representing more than two-thirds of the market – have submitted inflated bills…and four of the five largest players – United Health, Humana, Elevance, and Kaiser – have faced federal lawsuits alleging that efforts to overdiagnose their customers crossed the line into fraud.\"Additionally, according to the federal Medicare Payment Advisory Commission\\'s2022 report to Congress, at least $12 billion in overpayments were made to Medicare Advantage plans in 2020 by the federal government.  The \"Save Medicare Act\" will eliminate the confusion private insurers have relied upon for years to enroll unsuspecting seniors, and restore true Medicare as the primary health plan older Americans rely on.

Not only does the bill increase Social Security\\'s modest benefits, it also ensures that future cost of living adjustments will keep up with rising health care costs and other expenses that beneficiaries face.

       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, DC (February 7, 2019) – U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Marcy Kaptur (OH-09) today introduced legislation that would penalize pharmaceutical companies that engage in price gouging without cause, leading to price spikes for patients who rely on medication to treat diseases ranging from cancer to addiction. The Stop Price Gouging Act, would hold drug companies accountable for large price increases and result in billions of dollars in savings for taxpayers. U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) are introducing companion legislation in the Senate.The Stop Price Gouging Act would:Require drug companies to report increases in drug prices, and justify the increase.Penalize drug companies that engage in unjustified price increases with financial penalties proportionate to the price spike.\"Despite President Trump claiming victory on declining prescription drug prices, the costs of many drugs are still skyrocketing and becoming increasingly unaffordable for millions of Americans,\" said Pocan. \"The Stop Price Gouging Act will hold corporations accountable and protect consumers from egregious year-after-year price spikes that are far too common. While American families struggle over whether to pay an electric bill or buy life-saving medications, drug manufacturers and CEOs should not be making excessive profits. Members of Congress should immediately support this legislation and deliver results for the American people who are being hit with outrageous drug prices daily.\"\"We must stand up to pharmaceutical companies that are more worried about lining their own pockets and bolstering profits for Wall Street investors than making sure patients can access the life-saving medications they produce,\" said Kaptur. \"As policymakers, we must shine a light on price gouging. The predatory pricing practice must stop. The health and well-being of millions of Americans depends on it.\"\"The purpose of medicine is to help people, not to line the pockets of Big Pharma executives. Too many hardworking Americans still struggle to afford the medicine they need, and often, the culprit is price gouging by big pharmaceutical corporations. It has to stop. The Stop Price Gouging Act would protect Ohioans from prescription drug price spikes by requiring drug companies to report and justify their decisions to increase prices and prevent big pharma from price gouging,\" said Brown.\"Too many New Yorkers are suffering because drug companies care more about their own profits than whether sick patients have access to medicine. That is one of the root causes of our country\\'s skyrocketing prescription drug costs, and Congress needs to step in and solve this problem now,\" said Gillibrand. \"This urgently needed legislation would finally hold companies accountable and penalize them when they gouge the price of a prescription drug without cause. I am proud to introduce this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in fighting to pass it.\"Under current law, pharmaceutical corporations can increase the price of their products without justification. Pocan and Kaptur introduced this bill last Congress and said they would continue fighting to pass it this session of Congress. Any revenues collected through the Stop Price Gouging Act would be reinvested in future drug research and development at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).In 2018, Americans spent an all-time high of $360 billion on prescription drugs. Nearly one-third of Americans polled by Consumer Reports said they had experienced a drug price hike in the past year, shelling out a total of $2 billion more for a drug they routinely take. Their 2016 survey revealed that 30 percent of Americans who experienced a hike in the price of one or more of their medications in the past year left a prescription unfilled because it was too expensive; 15 percent said they cut pills in half to make them last longer.###',\n",

       "  'date': 'May 14, 2015',\n",
       "  'text': 'WASHINGTON, D.C.—U.S. Representatives Mark Pocan (WI-02) and Luke Messer (IN-06) today introduced legislation to help working Americans better plan for retirement. For most members of the workforce, a combination of Social Security and 401(k) savings or an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) will provide them with monthly income when they retire.  Unfortunately, nearly 60% of American workers have never calculated how much money they will need to save to live comfortably in retirement. The Lifetime Income Disclosure Act (H.R. 2317), introduced by Messer and Pocan would help change that.  Under the bill, certain retirement plans, like 401(k)s would be required to include what\\'s called an \"annuity equivalent\" on a participant\\'s statement.    That means, on each statement, a person\\'s current retirement balance will be illustrated as if they were receiving a monthly paycheck for life.\"This is a small but important step when it comes to helping American workers plan for retirement,\" said Messer.  \"Showing someone the value of their retirement account balance as a monthly income payment will give them a better of idea of how much they are saving and whether or not it\\'s enough to enjoy a comfortable standard of living after leaving the workforce.\"Said Congressman Pocan of the Lifetime Income Disclosure Act, \"Seeing how retirement savings translate into an expected monthly payment is a powerful way for workers to see their retirement security grow and drives home the importance of saving early and often.  The Social Security Administration already discloses benefits in terms of monthly income. This bill creates a similar straightforward tool to help workers with employer sponsored retirement plans determine if they are on track to meeting their retirement goals.\"A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that workers who saw their savings illustrated as monthly income were better informed about retirement planning, were more likely to know how much to save and had higher confidence in their expected retirement income. This week, Senators Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) introduced companion legislation in the Senate (S. 1317).Original cosponsors of the Lifetime Income Disclosure Act include Congressmen Jared Polis (CO-02), Dave Reichert (WS-08) and Ron Kind (WI-03)Supporters of bill include: American Council of Life Insurers, American Retirement Association, Insured Retirement Institute, MassMutual, Pension Rights Center, Prudential, TIAA-CREF and Women\\'s Institute for a Secure Retirement.###',\n",
