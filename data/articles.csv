1,Economy,Rep. Sewell Announces $16.9 Million from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to Upgrade Montgomery Bus System,"July 9, 2024","Montgomery, AL — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced $16,941,377 from the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) to upgrade the City of Montgomery’s bus system. Funding comes from USDOT’s Bus and Bus Facilities Grant Program and was made possible by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The grant will help the City of Montgomery buy new battery electric buses, charging equipment, and initiate a workforce training program.
Rep. Sewell was the only member of Alabama’s Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
“This is great news for the City of Montgomery!” celebrated Rep. Sewell. “I was so proud to help secure this $16.9 million investment in the M Public Transit System Electric Bus Program, and I know that it will go a long way toward improving travel for commuters. As the only member of Alabama’s Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, I am overjoyed to see investments like these coming to our state. I applaud Secretary Buttigieg and the entire Biden-Harris Administration for utilizing transportation as another tool to help us build a more sustainable future.”
“Today, 117 communities, including Montgomery, are receiving the good news that their transit buses are being modernized and their commutes improved through President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “The Biden-Harris Administration is helping agencies across 47 states replace old buses running on dirty, expensive fuels by delivering modern and zero-emission buses, manufactured by American workers, that will connect more people to where they need to go.”
“This grant is a significant milestone for our community and will propel us towards a more sustainable and efficient public transit system,” said Montgomery Mayor Steven L. Reed. “This will allow our M Transit System to purchase electric buses, charging equipment, and initiate a workforce training program that will create new jobs. I extend my deepest gratitude to Congresswoman Terri Sewell, the Federal Transit Administration, and the Department of Transportation for supporting Montgomery with this grant.”
Background on The Grants for Buses and Bus Facilities Competitive Program
The Grants for Buses and Bus Facilities Competitive Program (49 U.S.C. 5339(b)) makes federal resources available to states and direct recipients to replace, rehabilitate and purchase buses and related equipment and to construct bus-related facilities, including technological changes or innovations to modify low or no emission vehicles or facilities. Funding is provided through formula allocations and competitive grants.
The Federal Transit Administration’s bus funding represents the third bus grant package since President Biden signed the?Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which has invested more than $3.3 billion in American transit buses and the infrastructure that supports them. Over the next three years, record funding for American transit investment secured under President Biden's leadership will provide almost $5 billion more for bus programs.

2,Economy,Rep. Sewell Announces $14+ Million in Department of Transportation RAISE Grants for the Cities of York and Fairfield,"June 24, 2024","Fairfield, AL — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced $14,749,000 from the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) to reduce blocked railroad crossings, enhance transportation networks, and create more walkable, bikeable, safe, connected, and livable communities in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. Funding comes from USDOT’s Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grant program. The City of York was awarded $3 million to alleviate dangerous blocked railroad crossings and the City of Fairfield was awarded $11.7 million to construct 3.8 miles of bicycle facilities. 
“Today marks a major step forward in our fight to eliminate blocked railroad crossing and provide safer and more accessible transportation systems in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District!” celebrated Rep. Sewell. “I was so proud to help the City of York and the City of Fairfield secure this $14 million to make our communities more walkable, bikeable, and livable. I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration, Secretary Buttigieg, and Federal Railroad Administrator Bose for making these transformational investments as we bring more resources and better opportunities to our communities here in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District.” 
In York, the $3 million RAISE grant will be used to plan and design improvements between railroad-highway grade crossings and community impacts such as stopped and idling freight and passenger trains along Norfolk Southern Railways (NSR) AGS South District which also supports Amtrak's Crescent service. The plan will provide recommended improvements to the multimodal freight corridor, including those that seek to reduce conflicts with residential areas, as well as with passing and non-motorized traffic.
“It is a great day!” said York Mayor Willie Lake. “Train blockages have been hindering York for the last 25 years and this is a step in the right direction to help alleviate the stress that the trains have been causing. We’re looking forward to working with Norfolk Southern, FRA, USDOT, Alabama Transportation Institute, and all the partners involved as we move forward. It is a great day.”
“We want to thank Congresswoman Sewell and her office for all that she did to highlight this issue including bringing Secretary Buttigieg to Alabama to see the blockages for himself,” continued Lake. “We are eternally grateful for all of the support she has provided to the City. It has been a long struggle.”
In Fairfield, the $11.7 million RAISE Grant will go towards constructing approximately 3.8 miles of bicycle facilities along Dr. MLK Boulevard, Vinesville Road, and 52nd Street Ensley in Fairfield and Birmingham. The project will also construct three mobility hubs near the bicycle facilities. 
“This RAISE Grant is going to be transformational for the City of Fairfield. It will not only give our citizens a safe place to exercise but will also help with economic development along the walking trail and better connect students from Miles College to the rest of the community,” said Fairfield Mayor Eddie Penny. “I want to thank Congresswoman Sewell and the Freshwater Land Trust for helping the city get this grant which will be very beneficial for the citizens of Fairfield.” 
Background on the RAISE Grant Program
The RAISE Grant program provides a unique opportunity for the DOT to invest in road, rail, transit and port projects that promise to achieve national objectives. Previously known as the Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) and Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Discretionary Grants, Congress has dedicated nearly $12.1 billion for fourteen rounds of National Infrastructure Investments to fund projects that have a significant local or regional impact. 
In each competition, DOT receives hundreds of applications to build and repair critical pieces of our freight and passenger transportation networks. The RAISE program enables DOT to examine these projects on their merits to help ensure that taxpayers are getting the highest value for every dollar invested.

3,Economy,Rep. Sewell Hosts Seniors Resource Roundtable in Linden,"June 18, 2024","Sewell highlighted how the Inflation Reduction Act is lowering prescription drug prices and capping insulin costs for Alabama seniors
Linden, AL — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) hosted a Seniors Resource Roundtable in Linden, Alabama. Representatives from AARP, the Social Security Administration, the Rural Health Medical Program, and the Alabama Tombigbee Regional Area on Aging were on hand to provide information and resources to seniors in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. Rep. Sewell highlighted how the Inflation Reduction Act is lowering health care and prescription drug costs for hundreds of thousands of Alabama seniors. She reiterated her strong commitment to protecting and expanding Social Security and Medicare.
Photos are available for media and broadcast purposes here.
“I convened this roundtable because I believe that every senior should be able to retire with dignity after a lifetime of work,” said Rep. Sewell. “Our seniors have spent their lives giving back to our communities, and we as Americans have a responsibility to ensure they receive the resources and care they need at a cost they can afford. I understand that. President Biden understands that. And it’s why we have made delivering for our seniors a top priority.”
With Rep. Sewell’s support, Congress passed and President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022. Thanks to the IRA’s $35 per month insulin price cap, more than 29,000 Alabama seniors who rely on insulin—including 3,800 in Alabama’s 7th District—are saving an average of $400 annually compared to 2020. As a result of this law, the three largest manufacturers of insulin, who supply nearly all the insulin in the United States, announced that they would slash the cost of their insulins by up to 75%.
The IRA also caps out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries at $2,000 annually beginning in 2025 and empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices to get a better deal for seniors.
“The bottom line is this,” continued Sewell. “No senior should have to choose between putting food on the table or paying for life-saving medication. That’s why these savings matter. It’s why I will continue to protect programs like Social Security and Medicare which are a lifeline for our seniors.”

4,Economy,Rep. Sewell Announces $16.9 Million in EPA Rebates for Clean School Buses in Alabama,"May 29, 2024","Montgomery, AL —Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced $16,910,000 from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in rebate funding for clean school buses in Alabama. The rebates will help schools purchase over 51 clean school buses in 10 school districts across the state. EPA’s Clean School Bus program was created by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and will help Alabama accelerate the transition to zero emission vehicles and to replace older, diesel fueled school buses, which have been linked to asthma and other conditions that harm the health of students and surrounding communities. 
Rep. Sewell was the only member of Alabama’s Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. 
“President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is once again delivering for Alabama!” said Rep. Sewell. “Not only will this funding reduce pollution and make our communities healthier, but it will also save our school districts money and free up resources to invest in the success of our students. I was so proud to help make this program possible and I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration for this investment into Alabama’s schools."" 
School districts selected for rebates in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District include:

Selma City has been selected to receive $1,725,000 in rebate funding to purchase five clean school buses for the Lion Electric Co USA Inc. 
Montgomery County has been selected to receive $690,000 in rebate funding to purchase two clean school buses for the Lion Electric Co USA Inc. 

Other Alabama selectees include:

The Alabama Aerospace and Aviation has been selected to receive $400,000 in rebate funding to purchase two clean school buses for the Student Transportation of America, Inc. 
Clay County has been selected to receive $1,035,000 in rebate funding to purchase three clean school buses for the Transportation South, Inc. 
Fort Payne City has been selected to receive $1,380,000 in rebate funding to purchase four clean school buses for the Transportation South, Inc. 
Gulf Shores City has been selected to receive $600,000 in rebate funding to purchase three clean school buses for the Navistar Inc. 
Huntsville City has been selected to receive $ 8,625,000 in rebate funding to purchase 25 clean school buses for the First Student, Inc. 
Jasper City has been selected to receive $690,000 in rebate funding to purchase two clean school buses for the Transportation South, Inc. 
Lanett City has been selected to receive $1,725,000 in rebate funding to purchase five clean school buses for the Lion Electric Co USA Inc. 

The EPA Clean School Bus Program was created by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which provides an unprecedented $5 billion of funding to transform the nation’s fleet of school buses. The Clean School Bus Program funds electric buses, which produce zero tailpipe emissions, as well as propane and compressed natural gas (CNG) buses, which produce lower tailpipe emissions compared to their older diesel predecessors.
The Clean School Bus Program will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save money for school districts, and produce cleaner air. Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other conditions that harm students’ health and cause them to miss school, particularly in communities of color and Tribal communities. Phasing out these diesel engines will ensure cleaner air for students, bus drivers, and school staff working near the bus loading areas, and the communities through which the buses drive each day.
The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from these bus replacements will also help to address the outsized role of the transportation sector in fueling the climate crisis. The program will save school districts money as they upgrade school bus fleets, replacing existing buses with brand new zero-emission and clean school buses, while freeing up needed resources for schools.

5,Economy,Rep. Sewell Votes for FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024,"May 15, 2024","Washington D.C. —Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted in favor of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for five years. The bill will maintain American leadership in aviation safety and aerospace innovation, improve passenger protections and accessibility, strengthen and diversify the U.S. aviation workforce, and make groundbreaking investments in sustainability and resiliency.
The FAA Reauthorization Act passed the House today by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 387 to 26. Having previously passed the Senate, it will now make its way to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.
“Americans depend on the Federal Aviation Administration for safe and reliable air travel,” said Rep. Sewell. “With this strong, bipartisan legislation, we are ensuring that the FAA can continue its essential mission for years to come.”
“I am particularly excited about the new protections for airline passengers included in this bill,” continued Sewell. “Thanks to provisions secured by Democrats, Americans will finally be able to sit next to young family members at no cost, and passengers will enjoy additional protections when their flights are delayed or canceled. We also authorized additional funding to recruit workers from underrepresented communities so that we can build a more diverse and inclusive aviation workforce.”
Rep. Sewell and Congressional Democrats secured key wins in the FAA Reauthorization Act:
Improves and Expands Protections and Accessibility for Passengers:

It requires airlines to refund passengers with nonrefundable flights when their flight is canceled, significantly delayed, or changed if they choose not to fly on the delayed or changed flight.
It directs DOT to require airlines to develop policies addressing reimbursement for passengers for hotel and meal costs when a flight is canceled or significantly delayed.
It directs DOT to establish regulations requiring airlines to allow passengers to sit next to their young child to the greatest extent practical at no additional cost.

Strengthens and Diversifies the U.S. Aviation Workforce:

It significantly increases funding for the FAA’s aviation workforce development grants to $60 million to strengthen our talent pipeline of pilots, aviation maintenance technical workers, and aviation manufacturing workers. It also transitions these grants to a new Cooperative Aviation Recruitment, Enrichment, and Employment Readiness (CAREER) grant program, with broader eligibility to promote workforce development opportunities.
It also sets aside 20 percent of the total $60 million in funds for the Willa Brown Aviation Education Program to support outreach and educational opportunities in low-income communities.
It encourages the FAA to continue its outreach and engagement with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to promote awareness of educational and career opportunities. It also directs the FAA to continue the operation of the MSI Internship Program.

Terri Sewell (AL-07) spoke on the House Floor to honor two award-winning small businesses in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. Rep. Sewell recognized Ms. Jackie Smith, owner and operator of the Coffee Shoppe and Reflections in Selma, for being named the U.S. Small Business Administration’s (SBA) 2024 Phoenix Award Winner for Outstanding Disaster Recovery Efforts. Sewell also recognized Shanna Ullmann, Timothy Ullmann, and Robert Prescott of Transformation Partners, LLC in Tuscaloosa for being named SBA’s 2024 Small Business Persons of the Year for Alabama.
Watch it on YouTube here.
Rep. Sewell: Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the award-winning small business owners in Alabama's 7th Congressional District as we celebrate this week, National Small Business Week. 
Ms. Jackie Smith is the proud owner and operator of the Coffee Shoppe and Reflections in our hometown of Selma, Alabama. After leaving her job in 2011, Jackie bravely took on the risk of opening up her own small business, turning the site that once was a segregated diner into a beautiful coffee shop in the heart of downtown Selma. For 13 years, the Coffee Shoppe has provided a place for community to come together, learn about Selma's history, and eat some great food.
Like any business owner, Jackie has had her fair share of hardships. After the tornado of January 12, 2023, we saw her resilience, and thanks to an investment by the SBA, she was able to open her doors and continue the Coffee Shoppe's great legacy. And in fact, she opened up another business, Reflections. 
This week, Jackie's extraordinary entrepreneurship earned her national recognition as the Small Business Administration's 2024 Phoenix Award Winner for Outstanding Disaster Recovery Efforts. We congratulate her on her outstanding achievements. 
Today, we also recognize SBA's 2024 Small Business Persons of the Year in Alabama, and that was Shanna Ullmann, Timothy Ullmann, and Robert Prescott of Transformation Partners, LLC in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
Beginning in the year 2000 as a statewide training provider, her firm has grown tremendously over the past two decades. Today, they serve numerous clients in the field of higher education, government, military, corporate America, offering consulting services and employee development programming. 
Transformation Partners was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. But once again, thanks to the assistance of the SBA, the firm remained operational and weathered the storm. Now their efforts have earned them national recognition as SBA's 2024 National Small Business Persons of the Year for Alabama. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the outstanding entrepreneurship in Alabama's 7th Congressional District. Congratulations to all of our winners. We wish you much success in the years ahead.

9,Economy,Rep. Sewell Highlights How a Republican Government Shutdown Would Harm Families in Alabama,"September 27, 2023","A Republican shutdown would hurt working families, interrupt vital services, damage our economy, endanger our national security, and force millions of troops and government employees to work without pay
Washington D.C. – With just three days remaining until a potential extreme Republican government shutdown, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) warned that House Republicans are risking serious consequences for Alabama families.
“Alabama families shouldn’t be forced to pay the price for House Republicans’ inability to govern,” said Rep Sewell. “A Republican government shutdown would force troops to work without pay, harm small businesses, risk air travel disruptions, and endanger access to food assistance for families. It is unconscionable that House Republicans would hurt working families, damage our economy, and endanger our national security.”
“I will continue to do everything in my power to keep the government open and protect the programs that Alabamians rely on,” continued Sewell. “It’s time for House Republicans to do their jobs, put American families first, and stop charging towards a government shutdown.”
According to new data released by House Budget Committee Minority, a Republican government shutdown would:

Force troops to serve without pay: 38,017 active duty and reserve personnel serving our nation's armed forces in Alabama would be forced to go without the pay they earn during a shutdown.
Hurt Alabama small businesses: The Small Business Administration would stop processing small business loans, halting a program that provides $284,694,700 in funding to small businesses in Alabama every year.
Disrupt air travel: 4,797 people flying through Alabama airports every day would face potential delays and safety concerns due to staffing impacts on TSA agents and air traffic controllers.
Cut off food assistance for Alabama children and families: 111,999 people in Alabama would soon lose access to Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits. 772,813 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) beneficiaries in Alabama would lose access to benefits in a prolonged shutdown.
Hurt federal workers: 46,826 federal workers in Alabama would be furloughed or forced to work without pay, in addition to the many employees of businesses with government contracts who could be laid off, furloughed, or see their hours cut.
Jeopardize food and drug safety: Workers at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would be sidelined, risking interruptions and delays to the 224 food safety, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and other inspections conducted in Alabama last year.
Hurt rural Alabamians’ ability to secure housing loans: The Department of Agriculture would be forced to stop processing housing loans, which provide $545,442,546 in funding to help 3,049 families in rural Alabama communities buy homes every year.
Hurt Alabama farmers: The Department of Agriculture would be forced to stop processing farm loans which provide $93,451,000 in funding for farmers in Alabama every year.
Close National Parks: 1,294,952 people who visit national parks in Alabama every year would be turned away or unable to fully access parks, monuments, and museums.
Put vulnerable families at risk: State governments would be forced to pay for federal services like the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, potentially risking benefits for the 12,888 TANF beneficiaries in Alabama.

10,Economy,Rep. Sewell Celebrates One-Year Anniversary of the Landmark Inflation Reduction Act,"August 16, 2023","Birmingham, AL – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) celebrated the one-year anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, landmark legislation which continues to deliver for Alabama families. Over the last twelve months, the investments in the Inflation Reduction Act have lowered costs for Alabamians while creating new jobs, combating climate change, advancing environmental justice, and reducing the deficit—all without a penny in new taxes for Americans making under $400,000. Rep. Sewell was the only member of Alabama’s congressional delegation to vote in favor of the bill. 
“One year ago, President Biden signed into law a historic piece of legislation that is bringing down costs for Alabama families, growing the middle class with new clean energy and manufacturing jobs, and making the largest investment to fight climate change in our nation’s history,” said Rep. Sewell. “I was proud to be the only member of the Alabama delegation to vote in favor of the Inflation Reduction Act, and I’m even prouder today as it continues to deliver for our families, our communities, and our planet. We’re already seeing the investments from the Inflation Reduction Act lay the foundation for decades of economic growth and cost savings, and soon our provisions to cap prescription drug costs will provide even more breathing room for Alabama families.”
Many of the Inflation Reduction Act’s responsible, pro-growth policies are already at work for Alabamians right now, with even more progress on the way:
Lowering costs for families:

Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, the 31,000 people who signed up for a marketplace plan in Alabama’s 7th District are saving an average of $740 on their health care premiums this year.
Caps insulin prices for seniors and other Medicare beneficiaries at $35/month, saving about 3,800 people in Alabama’s 7th District who use insulin an average of $400 annually.
An estimated 367,000 Alabamians will save an average of $360 on prescription drugs every year when the $2,000 cap on annual out-of-pocket pharmacy costs for Americans with Medicare goes into effect in 2025.


Allows Medicare to finally negotiate prescription drug prices starting in 2026, slashing prices and saving taxpayers nearly $100 billion over the next 8 years.
Unleashes the power of cleaner, cheaper energy to save families hundreds of dollarson their energy bills every year and provides thousands of dollars in discounts to help families upgrade to more efficient appliances and vehicles.

Growing the middle class:

Delivers a clean energy future, with over 170,000 new jobs and $278 billion in new investments already announced in 44 states, including 400 clean energy jobs and $205 million in investments right here in Alabama’s 7th District.
Lays the foundation for the future of our economy with historic investments in clean energy and American manufacturing that are projected to create millions of jobs and reduce carbon pollution by 40 percent by 2030.
Gives more Americans a path to the middle class by expanding workforce training and registered apprenticeship programs to create good-paying jobs that don’t require a college degree.

Promoting tax fairness and reducing the deficit:

Achieves hundreds of billions of dollars in deficit reduction without a penny in new taxes on families making under $400,000 per year.

13,Economy,"Reps. Sewell, Johnson Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Level the Playing Field for American Workers","June 7, 2023","Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Bill Johnson (OH-06), along with Reps. Frank Mrvan and (IN-01) and Beth Van Duyne (TX-24), introduced bipartisan legislation to level the playing field for American workers. H.R. 3882, the Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0, would strengthen U.S. trade remedy laws to protect American workers and combat China’s unfair, anti-free market trade practices that distort the global market. Companion legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Todd Young (R-IN).
“As a member of the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, I am committed to ensuring that U.S. trade policy promotes fair competition and protects American workers against the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts to manipulate the global market,” said Rep. Sewell. “Along with Congressman Bill Johnson, I am proud to be introducing the Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 which would strengthen our trade remedy laws and push back against China’s egregious and unfair trade practices. We know that if American workers are given the opportunity to compete on a fair and level playing field, they will win on the world stage!”
“China’s communist regime continues taking deliberate steps that are hurting American workers and our economy by dumping steel, aluminum, and other products on the global markets with no repercussions. That must end,” said Rep. Johnson. “This bipartisan legislation will hold China accountable for these actions by ensuring that U.S. industries and the Department of Commerce have needed tools to seek relief from China’s illegal actions. A robust domestic steel and aluminum industry is critical to creating American jobs, strengthening our economy, and protecting our national security. We can’t wait any longer to act. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to ensure this bipartisan bill becomes law.”
“Thank you to Rep. Sewell for your steadfast leadership to update U.S. trade remedy laws and combat unfair trade practices,” said Rep. Mrvan. “Every effort must be taken to ensure that American workers can compete on a level playing field and thrive in our global economy.  I look forward to continuing to work with all of my colleagues to advance this critical legislation to support the ability of all American workers to grow our economy and provide for our national security.”
“The Chinese Communist Party routinely ignores established trading rules and aggressively works to cheat the system in an attempt to shut American workers and manufacturers out of the global market,” said Rep. Van Duyne. “I appreciate Reps. Sewell and Johnson for their leadership on this important issue, and I look forward to continuing our bipartisan work to stand up to the CCP’s unfair trade practices.”
The Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 combats many of China’s most egregious practices, such as:

Country Hopping to Escape U.S. Trade Remedies - After all the work of winning an anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) case, relief can be temporary as foreign producers move their factories to other countries to evade the AD/CVD orders. This legislation creates a new successive AD/CVD investigation to combat repeat offenders by making it easier for petitioners to bring new cases when production moves to another country. It also expedites timelines for successive investigations and factors for the International Trade Commission to consider about the relationship between recently completed trade cases and successive trade cases for the same imported product.


Belt and Road Initiative Subsidies - Currently, the Department of Commerce can only consider subsidies provided by the government under investigation. However, with the expansion of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, China is beginning to subsidize production in countries outside of China. This legislation would give Commerce the authority to apply CVD law to subsidies provided by a government to a company operating in a different country.


Circumventing U.S. Law - This legislation imposes statutory requirements for anti-circumvention inquiries to clarify the process and timeline. It also specifies the deadlines for preliminary and final determinations, which currently lack statutory deadlines.

The Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 enjoys strong support from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), the United Steelworkers (USW), and steel manufacturers in Alabama.
“By strengthening the effectiveness of the U.S. trade laws, this bill will help give the American public confidence that their government has every tool available to fight for a level playing field for the American steel industry and our workers,” said Kevin Dempsey, President and CEO of the American Iron and Steel Institute. “We appreciate the leadership of Representatives Johnson and Sewell in once again spearheading the fight to crack down on unfair trade and help preserve American jobs, competitiveness and cleaner American steel.”
“It has been eight years since Congress has updated our trade laws, and Representatives Terri Sewell and Bill Johnson have introduced the Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 to provide a much-needed refresh,” said United Steelworkers President Tom Conway. “The legislation will make U.S. trade laws more responsive to China’s foreign investments, which then dump product into the U.S. market. The bill also improves the process for follow-up on trade investigations, meaning U.S. workers and manufacturers can quickly move to stop unfair trade, wherever it comes from. USW endorses this bill and urges the House of Representatives to move quickly to pass it.”

14,Economy,Rep. Sewell Votes to Prevent Devastating Default,"May 31, 2023","Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass H.R. 3746, the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, to prevent a devastating default while rejecting Republicans’ extreme demands to make deep cuts to programs that Alabama families rely on. The agreement, negotiated by President Biden, protects against cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans’ health care, historic infrastructure and climate investments, and the 40 million borrowers in President Biden’s student debt relief plan. It also prevents Republicans from manufacturing a similar crisis in the next two years by suspending the debt limit until January 1, 2025. The bill passed the House Wednesday night by a vote of 314-117 and now heads to the Senate.
Watch Rep. Sewell’s remarks here. 
“House Republicans could have passed a clean bill to address the debt ceiling months ago, but instead chose to hold the American people hostage and bring our economy to the brink of crisis in order to advance their extreme agenda,” said Rep. Sewell.
“To be clear, this bill is far from perfect,” continued Sewell. “But it prevents a default. It prevents future efforts to hold this nation hostage for the rest of the 118th Congress, and it prevents cruel Republican cuts. This budget agreement that President Biden negotiated protects funding for education, health care, veterans’ benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Most importantly, it prevents Republicans from forcing a devastating default that would kill countless jobs in my district and destroy our economy.”
“I join in expressing my frustration with the crisis that my Republican colleagues have manufactured. The American people deserve better than a Republican Majority that chooses to govern crisis-by-crisis.”

15,Economy,Rep. Sewell Calls on Congress to Reject Republican Debt Ceiling Demands and Avoid Catastrophic Default,"April 26, 2023","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined nearly 200 of her colleagues from across the House Democratic Caucus in a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy calling on Republicans to uphold their obligation to protect the full faith and credit of the United States by lifting the debt ceiling “without any extraneous policies attached.”
“It is a sad day when House Republicans shamefully hold our economy hostage and threaten to default on our debt unless Congress makes deep cuts to programs that Alabamians rely on,” said Rep. Sewell. “We in Congress should never play politics with the full faith and credit of the United States of America. Republicans must join us to raise the debt ceiling—just as they did three times under the previous administration—and avoid economic collapse.”
“I am a strong believer in balancing our budget,” continued Sewell. “Despite Republicans’ 2017 tax giveaway to the wealthy—which added $2 trillion to our deficit—I am proud of the historic deficit reduction that we have achieved under President Biden. If Republicans want to address our national debt, they should start by making the wealthy pay their fair share instead of targeting veteran benefits, food assistance, and other programs that hard working Alabama families rely on.”
If agreed to, Speaker McCarthy’s debt ceiling demands would have devastating consequences for Alabama families. According to a report by the House Budget Committee Minority, House Republicans' debt ceiling proposal would:

Threaten access to food assistance for 17,000 people aged 50-55 in Alabama.
Eliminate preschool and child care for at least 5,600 children in Alabama.
Increase housing costs for at least 8,800 people in Alabama.
Make college more expensive for at least 98,900 students in Alabama.
Eliminate at least 3 air traffic control towers in Alabama.
Cut at least 150 rail safety inspection days in Alabama.
Repeal investments in cleaner, cheaper energy — threatening at least 1,280 clean energy and manufacturing jobs announced in Alabama since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.

If Republicans do not get their way, and instead choose to cause an unprecedented credit default, they would unleash global economic catastrophe and put vital government services at risk. According to the report, a default would:

Kill about 6,000 jobs in Alabama’s 7th District alone. Nationwide, a default could kill more than 7 million jobs.
Jeopardize Social Security payments for 101,000 families in Alabama’s 7th District.
Put health benefits at risk for 306,000 people in Alabama’s 7th District who rely on Medicare, Medicaid, or Veterans Affairs health coverage.
Increase lifetime mortgage costs for the typical homeowner in Alabama by $43,000.
Raise the costs of a new car loan for the typical American by $800.
Threaten the retirement savings of 91,400 people near retirement in Alabama’s 7th District, eliminating $20,000 from the typical retirement portfolio.

Rep. Sewell and her Democratic colleagues made clear that while they welcome debate on spending and economic responsibility, negotiations over spending must be distinct from the threat of economic default, and any cuts to Social Security and Medicare are off the table.

16,Economy,"Rep. Sewell Joins Reps. Tenney, Davis, and Kelly in Introducing the Bipartisan New Markets Tax Credit Extension Act","April 6, 2023","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined Reps. Claudia Tenney (NY-24), Danny Davis (IL-07), and Mike Kelly (PA-16) in introducing the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Extension Act. This legislation would spur investment and economic growth in Alabama’s rural and underserved communities by making the NMTC a permanent fixture of our tax code.  
Set to expire on December 31, 2025, the New Markets Tax Credit was established in the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000, and is an essential source of financing for businesses and community facilities in low-income and rural areas across the country. The NMTC provides private investors with a 39 percent credit against federal income taxes for investments made in some of the most distressed communities in the nation. This bill makes the NMTC a permanent part of the Internal Revenue Code, indexes allocation levels to inflation in future years, and exempts NMTC investments from the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). 
“In Alabama’s 7th Congressional District, we have seen firsthand the power of the New Markets Tax Credit to spur investment and incentivize economic growth in some of our most vulnerable and underserved communities,” said Rep. Sewell. “The New Markets Tax Credit remains a critical tool to promote job creation and provide opportunities to those who need them most. We must ensure that this tool is made a permanent part of our tax code, and that’s exactly what this legislation would do.”
“Now more than ever, it is essential that we work to create investments in our rural and low-income communities,” said Rep. Tenney, lead Republican sponsor. “Rural America is often forgotten by the Washington elites, which means that rural communities sometimes lack the necessary resources to invest, grow, and expand. Congress must make the New Markets Tax Credit permanent to allow our rural communities to continue accessing this important resource which helps to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. As a small business owner from rural America, I will always be a tenacious advocate for investments in our rural communities and businesses in Congress.”
“Over the years, the New Markets Tax Credit has well-proven its worth by revitalizing neighborhoods and cities that need the help the most,” said Rep. Kelly. “The New Markets Tax Credit Extension (NMTC) Act would allow more communities across the country to receive the benefits that I have seen firsthand in my district, including 518 new jobs from three projects in Northwestern Pennsylvania. Since the program’s inception, the NMTC has created over 24,000 permanent jobs and 27,000 construction across Pennsylvania. Along with revitalizing American’s Main Streets, the NMTC program is a job creator and I’m proud to support this legislation again in the 118th Congress!”
“The New Markets Tax Credit has been and remains absolutely vital for many of America’s urban neighborhoods and rural communities and will provide billions of dollars for high-impact, community revitalization projects,” said Bob Rapoza, spokesperson for the NMTC Coalition. “Over the years, the credit has been instrumental in financing plant and equipment for small manufacturing businesses and patient, flexible capital to other small businesses, hospitals, healthcare centers, homeless shelters and other transformative projects that improve communities, create jobs and economic opportunity. We appreciate the leadership of Representatives Tenney and Sewell in promoting more investment in distressed communities.”
“We commend Representatives Tenney and Sewell for leading the way to make the New Markets Tax Credit a permanent part of the tax code. It is one of the most concrete steps the 118th Congress could take to spur investment in economically distressed communities—from rural towns to urban neighborhoods, and everywhere in between,” said Lori Chatman, Interim co-CEO, Enterprise Community Partners. “This proposal is a bipartisan opportunity to add stability and efficiency to a program that has already delivered $120 billion in community assets and created more than 1 million jobs nationwide, including NMTCs Enterprise recently provided to finance the GLOW Healthy Living Campus in Batavia, New York.”
Additional cosponsors include Rep. Miller (R-WV), Rep. Ferguson (R-GA), Rep. Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Rep. Schweikert (R-AZ), Rep. Smucker (R-PA), Rep. Wenstrup (R-OH), Rep. LaHood (R-IL), Rep.

17,Economy,Reps. Sewell and Smucker and Sens. Hickenlooper and Tillis Introduce Bill to Expand Retirement Savings for Working Americans,"December 8, 2022","Bipartisan, bicameral Retirement Savings for Americans Act would make saving for retirement reliable, real, and attainable for American workers
Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Lloyd Smucker (PA-11) introduced H.R. 9462, the Retirement Savings for Americans Act, a bipartisan, bicameral bill to improve retirement security and financial well-being for low- and middle-income American workers. Specifically, the bill would establish a new program that gives eligible workers access to portable, tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts. It would also offer federal matching contributions for low- and middle-income workers, with the match beginning to phase out at median income. Companion legislation was introduced by Sens. John Hickenlooper (D-CO) and Thom Tillis (R-NC) in the U.S. Senate.
“Every Alabamian and every American should be able to retire with dignity after a lifetime of work,” said Rep. Sewell. “This critical, bipartisan legislation would address serious gaps in our retirement system and make it easier for low- and middle-income workers to save for retirement. I was proud to work with my House and Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance this commonsense bill which would level the playing field for working families and build a stronger economy for all Americans.”
“I appreciate the opportunity to advance meaningful bipartisan legislation to assist hardworking Americans save for their retirement,” said Rep. Lloyd Smucker. “Our legislation, the Retirement Savings for Americans Act, will create a pathway for millions of Americans to find financial security in their retirement. I look forward to continuing to advance this legislation in the next Congress and building upon the successes of SECURE 2.0 to help Americans become financially secure in their retirements.”
“Too many Americans are working their entire adult lives only to reach retirement and find they don’t have enough saved,” said Sen. Hickenlooper. “Helping people save is an easy, efficient way to cut income inequality while making sure all workers get the retirement they’ve earned.”
“Roughly 40 million Americans lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, which represents a significant roadblock to achieving financial security for their retirement,” said Sen. Tillis. “The Retirement Savings for Americans Act tackles this real problem by establishing a pathway for savings for Americans lacking retirement options.”
Around one-third of private-sector workers lack access to a workplace retirement plan, and roughly half of households are at risk of taking a cut to their standard of living in retirement.
The bill contains the following provisions:

Eligibility and Auto Enrollment: Full- and part-time workers who lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan would be eligible for an account, and they would be automatically enrolled at 3% of their income. They could choose to increase or decrease their withholding, or opt out entirely at any time. Independent workers (including gig workers) would also be eligible.
Federal Contribution: Low- and moderate-income workers would be eligible for a 1% automatic contribution (as long as they remain employed) and up to a 4% matching contribution via a refundable federal tax credit. This would begin to phase out at median income.
Portability: Accounts would remain attached to workers throughout their lifetimes, and workers would be able to stop and start contributions at will.
Private Assets: The accounts would be the property of the worker and the assets could be passed down to future generations to help them build wealth and financial security.
Investment Options: Much like the current TSP, participants would be given a menu of simple, low-fee investment options to choose from, including lifecycle funds tied to a worker’s estimated retirement date, or index funds made of stocks and bonds.

“Far too many Americans are unprepared for retirement. The Retirement Savings for Americans Act would tackle serious gaps in the U.S. retirement system that have hindered millions of workers from saving for a more certain and secure future,” said Economic Innovation Group (EIG) President and CEO John Lettieri. “By incorporating a range of proven features, this innovative legislation would greatly expand market access to high quality retirement plans and target savings incentives to workers who need them most. The result would be a healthier retirement system, a more secure workforce, and a stronger economy to the benefit of all Americans. EIG applauds Senators Hickenlooper and Tillis and Representatives Sewell and Smucker for their bipartisan dedication to empowering American workers.”

18,Economy,"Reps. Sewell, Cleaver, and Swalwell Introduce Bill to Ensure U.S. Car Buyers and Automakers Fully Benefit from Cost-Cutting Tax Credits","November 4, 2022","Washington, D.C. — This week, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) Emanuel Cleaver (MO-05), and Eric Swalwell (CA-15) introduced the Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act which would ensure that car buyers and automakers in the United States—and particularly those in Alabama—may immediately and fully benefit from the cost-cutting and job-creating provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), including tax credits that will lower the costs of electric vehicles. The bill would create a phase-in for the electric vehicle (EV) sourcing and manufacturing requirement provisions for automakers that was included in the final version of the IRA.
“Democrats’ historic Inflation Reduction Act includes critical tax credits that are bringing down the cost of electric vehicles and making them more accessible to working and middle class Alabamians, all while accelerating our transition to a clean energy economy,” said Rep. Sewell. “The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act is a win-win for Alabama, ensuring that automakers and car buyers alike can take advantage of these tax credits immediately. My Democratic colleague and I will continue working to tackle inflation and lower costs!”
“I’m proud to introduce the Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act with Congresswoman Sewell as we seek to lower energy costs for American families, create good-paying manufacturing jobs here at home, and accelerate our nation’s transition away from costly fossil fuels and toward affordable, clean vehicles,” said Rep. Cleaver. “Our legislation takes important steps to make the historic electric vehicle tax credits passed in the Inflation Reduction Act immediately accessible to consumers, particularly working- and middle-class Americans who would like to purchase an electric vehicle but need the federal credit to do so. As oil companies insist on continuing their exorbitant price-gouging of American families at the pump, these tax credits offer hardworking Americans immediate and significant financial assistance to help them purchase a vehicle that is better both for the environment and their wallets. This bill would be a major win for consumers, auto-workers, and businesses alike, and I will work with my colleagues to ensure it is signed into law by President Biden.”
The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act would delay the IRA’s phase-in period for automakers to follow specific sourcing requirements for their EVs in order for car buyers to qualify for the federal tax credit. These requirements include: requiring the EVs to be manufactured in North America; requiring EV batteries to be made domestically; and mandating that critical minerals used in battery production are only sourced domestically or from nations with whom America has a free trade agreement. Alabama automakers need additional time to meet these new on-shoring requirements and bring planned domestic EV facilities online, including the forthcoming Hyundai EV facility scheduled to open in 2025 in Bryan County, GA.
Companion legislation was introduced in the Senate by Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA).
“The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act will lower costs and provide consumers more options when purchasing an electric vehicle, while also supporting good-paying jobs across Georgia and our country,” said Sen. Rev. Warnock. “I’m focused squarely on helping car buyers save money and helping car manufacturers who do business in our state thrive. That’s why I’m pleased to partner with Representatives Sewell and Cleaver to get this bill over the finish line.” Bill text is available here.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means

20,Economy,Rep. Sewell Announces $21+ Million from Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for Clean Transit Buses in Jefferson County and University of Alabama,"August 16, 2022","Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced over $21 million in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for clean transit buses in Alabama. $13,654,636 will be awarded to the Birmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority and $7,890,065 will be awarded to the University of Alabama. This funding is part of a $1.66 billion investment by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in 150 bus fleets and facilities across the nation to reduce pollution and meet President Biden’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. This year's funding alone will nearly double the number of no-emission transit buses on America's roadways. In Alabama, this funding will improve safety and reliability of transit services for residents of the Birmingham and Tuscaloosa regions while reducing pollution and advancing environmental justice.
The Birmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority (BJCTA) will receive $13,654,636 to build a new maintenance facility and buy compressed natural gas, hydrogen fuel-cell and battery electric buses and charging equipment. This project and the new vehicles will improve the safety and reliability of transit service for residents in Jefferson County.
The University of Alabama will receive $7,890,065 to replace diesel buses with new electric buses, buy charging equipment, and train maintenance workers to support the new electric bus fleet. The project will ensure continued service reliability, maintain a state of good repair, improve air quality, and advance environmental justice in the Tuscaloosa community.
“It’s hard to overstate the transformational impact that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is having here in Alabama,” said Rep. Sewell. “Once again, we’re seeing much-needed funding coming to our communities to upgrade our infrastructure, connect our communities, and clean up our environment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a true testament to what we can achieve when we put people over politics, and I was proud to be the only Member of Congress from Alabama to support it.”
“With this announcement, we’re bringing millions of dollars to Jefferson County for brand new vehicles and a new maintenance facility to keep them running smoothly,” continued Sewell. “That means safer and more reliable bus services for the residents of the Birmingham region. For our University of Alabama campus community, this announcement means better, greener buses and a cleaner, healthier environment.”
These two projects were among 150 to be selected by the FTA out of a pool of more than 530 eligible proposals. The bus grant awards—made under FTA's Buses and Bus Facilitiesand Low- and No-Emission Vehicle programs—are FTA's first competitive grant selections under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

21,Economy,Rep. Sewell Votes to Send Historic Inflation Reduction Act to President Biden’s Desk,"August 12, 2022","Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, a historic legislative package that will tackle inflation, drive down health care and energy costs, cut the deficit, and make the largest investment to combat climate change in United States history. The bill is fully paid for by making the wealthiest corporations begin to pay their fair share. Included in the bill is Rep. Sewell’s climate justice legislation to reduce pollution and promote carbon capture technology. The Inflation Reduction Act passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 220-207 with every Democrat voting in favor of this significant legislation. Having passed the Senate last Sunday, the bill now heads to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.
“With passage of the historic Inflation Reduction Act, Congressional Democrats have once again delivered a major victory for the American people, the State of Alabama, and our planet!” said Rep. Sewell. “This bill caps drug costs for Alabama seniors and extends critical health care subsidies to drive down costs for families, all without raising taxes on anyone making under $400,000 per year. Instead, this bill is fully paid for by making the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share.”
“The Inflation Reduction Act also marks a major turning point in our fight to advance environmental justice, reduce pollution, and combat climate change,” continued Sewell. “I was proud to see that my bill, the Carbon Capture and Sequestration Expansion Act, was included in the climate title of this bill. While my colleagues on the other side spread falsehoods to protect billion-dollar corporations and special interests, I’m proud that my Democratic colleagues and I once again came together to deliver legislation that puts people over politics. I know this legislation will make a world of difference for so many Alabama families.”
The Inflation Reduction Act takes bold action to lower health care costs and slash prescription drug costs for Alabamians. By extending the Affordable Care Act enhanced subsidies that are set to expire in January 2023 for three more years, the Inflation Reduction Act locks in lower health care premiums for 209,000 Alabamians who will save an average of $800 annually per person. It also empowers Medicare to negotiate lower prices for about 100 high cost, single-source drugs over the next decade. For Medicare beneficiaries, the bill caps out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,000 annually and caps the cost of insulin at $35 per month. Under this bill, if drug companies raise prices in Medicare faster than the rate of inflation, they are required to pay rebates back to Medicare for the difference, beginning in October 2022.  
The Inflation Reduction Act is the largest investment to fight climate change, clean up pollution, and advance environmental justice in U.S. history. The bill’s $370 billion in climate resiliency investments would reduce U.S. carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030, and its $60 billion in environmental justice priorities will drive investments into disadvantaged communities. Notably, thanks to a provision cosponsored by Rep. Sewell, the bill reinstates the Superfund tax on crude oil and petroleum products to ensure that Superfund sites like the one in North Birmingham have the resources needed for environmental cleanup. The bill also includes Sewell’s climate justice legislation, the Carbon Capture and Sequestration Expansion Act, to reduce pollution and promote carbon capture technology.
Contrary to Republican falsehoods, the Inflation Reduction Act contains no new taxes on families making $400,000 or less and no new taxes on small businesses. The bill is fully paid for by strengthening IRS enforcement against wealthy tax cheats, closing tax loopholes exploited by the wealthiest few, and implementing a 15% corporate minimum tax—which applies only to the 150 corporations earning over $1 billion in profits. Thanks to these provisions, the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to reduce the deficit by over $300 billion over the next decade.
The Inflation Reduction Act enjoys bipartisan support from the American people, as well as a wide range of experts, climate activists, labor unions, business leaders and advocacy organizations. Over 7 in 10 voters overwhelmingly back the Inflation Reduction Act, including 95 percent of Democrats, nearly three-quarters of independents, and more than half of Republicans, according to a recent poll by Data for Progress.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
22,Economy,Rep. Sewell Votes for CHIPS and Science Act to Power American Economic Leadership and Lower Costs,"July 28, 2022","Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted for historic, bipartisan legislation to strengthen Alabama families’ financial future, boost America’s research advantage and safeguard our economic and national security for generations to come. The CHIPS and Science Act will deliver a powerful investment in America’s global competitiveness—creating jobs, slashing kitchen table costs, ending dependence on foreign manufacturers, and turbocharging American innovation. The bill passed the House today by a vote of 243 to 187. Previously passed by the Senate, this legislation now heads to the President’s desk to be signed into law.
“The CHIPS and Science Act is a victory for Alabama and our nation!” said Rep. Sewell. “This major legislation is all about ensuring that America remains a world leader in science, technology, and innovation. By turbocharging our production of semiconductors, the CHIPS and Science Act will strengthen American manufacturing, lower costs, and bolster our independence from foreign suppliers, all while creating good-paying jobs here at home. I’m also thrilled that this bill will bring research investments to our local communities to help diversify our STEM workforce. I look forward to seeing President Biden sign it into law!”
A nationwide shortage of semiconductor chips has severely disrupted American manufacturing,  slowing down production, spiking prices and increasing dependence on unfriendly foreign nations. Only 12 percent of semiconductor chips are currently manufactured domestically—a dramatic drop from 37 percent in the 1990s—while foreign competitors are investing heavily to dominate this critical national security industry. Other nations have also begun to outpace the United States’ research advantage, threatening American preeminence in technology and scientific innovation.   
The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act will reverse these dangerous trends, reasserting America’s economic independence and scientific dominance. Thanks to the strong leadership of House Democrats, this legislation:

Lowers costs for American consumers – by making more critical semiconductor components in America, helping end the shortage of chips that have driven up the price of everything from cars to consumer goods.
Creates 100,000 new good-paying jobs – creates strong Davis-Bacon jobs building hi-tech manufacturing facilities here in America.
Ends our dangerous dependence on foreign manufacturers – bringing critical semiconductor manufacturing back to America instead of overseas where it can be threatened by our adversaries.
Turbocharges American R&D – powering America’s preeminence in both basic research and next-generation technologies and ensuring that the technologies of the future are made here in America.
Diversifies and expands the innovation workforce – broadening the pool of brainpower and talent so that we are embracing the full potential from all our communities, helping to diversify our STEM workforce and advancing regional technology hubs to ensure communities across the country can help in American research and development.

This legislation also includes strong guardrails to ensure that federal semiconductor investments go straight into Alabama’s economy—not corporate pockets or unfriendly nations. The CHIPS and Science Act will:

Prohibit companies from using chips funding for stock buybacks or dividend payments.
Bar funding recipients from expanding semiconductor manufacturing in countries of concern.
Require strong oversight and tight Congressional control over the use of federal funds.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
23,Economy,"Rep. Sewell Votes to Invest in Alabama Families, Economy with Fiscal Year 2023 Government Funding Package","July 20, 2022","Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to invest in Alabama families and the American economy with government funding legislation for Fiscal Year 2023. This legislation will support our neighbors and families, create good-paying jobs, and protect Alabamians’ health and well-being. Within this package, Rep. Sewell secured millions in funding for local community projects in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. It will now make its way to the U.S. Senate.
“This government funding package invests in Alabama families and advances many of the priorities that Alabamians value most, creating good-paying jobs, improving our infrastructure, and bolstering our economy,” said Rep. Sewell. “I’m so proud to have helped secure millions of dollars in funding for local projects in our district! The funding for these projects responds directly to the needs of our communities, which is why I fought so hard for its inclusion. It is my hope that the Senate will swiftly approve this funding and send it to President Biden’s desk.”
Rep. Sewell secured funding for the following local community projects in the FY2023 government funding which passed the House today:

$4,000,000 for Blight Removal in Montgomery - The funding would be used to redevelop blighted properties within the City of Montgomery with the intention to revitalize neighborhoods that have historically seen a lack of investment opportunities.
$4,000,000 for the Selma Riverfront Multi-Plex - The funding would be used to acquire, redevelop and construct a center for essential public safety services accessible for all members of the community.
$4,000,000 for the Birmingham Valley Creek Rails to Trails Project - The funding would be used to redevelop and construct a 4.57-mile recreation and transportation project for low-income city residents.
$500,000 for the Town of Orrville Public Library - The funding would be used for the construction of a new municipal public library providing access to educational resources for a historically underserved community.
$750,000 for the Bethel Baptist Church Family and Child Center - The funding would be used to construct a multi-purpose community center providing child care and educational support for youth & families in a neighborhood that has experienced economic hardship and overall lack of investment for decades.
$1,500,000 for the Historic Brown Chapel AME Church Restoration - The funding would be used to stabilize the structure of the building to allow for further restoration of the sanctuary, bell towers, and brickwork. This much needed restoration is important because the church is a significant part of the Civil Rights movement story.
$6,800,000 for a F-35 Weapons Load Crew Training Facility at the Montgomery Regional Airport Base - The funding would be used to construct a Weapons Load Crew Training facility utilizing conventional design and construction methods to accommodate the mission of the facility. This arrangement will improve the ability to train weapons load crews and certify their continued readiness.
$15,000,000 for a Commercial Vehicle Inspection Gate at Maxwell Air Force Base - The funding would be used to construct a commercial vehicle inspection and entry control facility area. This project will provide perimeter protection and security of Air Force personnel and assets, prevent unauthorized access, and maximize traffic flow.

As a whole, this government funding package will secure critical investments in a range of key priorities for Alabama communities:

Creating Good-Paying Jobs by upgrading Alabama’s roads, bridges, public transit, rail, airports and water infrastructure.

24,Economy,Rep. Sewell Welcomes Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to Birmingham to Announce Program to Reconnect Communities,"June 30, 2022","Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined Mayor Randall Woodfin to welcome U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg to Birmingham, Alabama. During his visit, Secretary Buttigieg announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is now accepting applications for the first-of-its-kind Reconnecting Communities program. Created by President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the $1 billion pilot program will help reconnect communities that were previously cut off from economic opportunities by transportation infrastructure. As the only member of Alabama’s congressional delegation to vote in favor of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Sewell fought to ensure that equity was a central focus of the legislation.
Thursday morning, Rep. Sewell hosted a roundtable discussion with Secretary Buttigieg, Mayor Woodfin, and community stakeholders to give local officials the opportunity to speak directly with federal leaders. They then embarked on a bus tour to give the Secretary a firsthand look at the Birmingham Xpress Bus Rapid Transit service, a program that will soon connect residents from 25 communities to jobs, schools, and healthcare. 
“I think it’s critically important that we bring together our local and federal officials for a chance to speak directly about the needs of those we serve,” said Rep. Sewell.“Conversations like these really help strengthen our partnership on behalf of the people of the 7th Congressional District and move our communities forward.”
Rep. Sewell joined Secretary Buttigieg and Mayor Woodfin for a press conference announcing the new Reconnecting Communities Program, a $1 billion, first-of-its-kind initiative from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law dedicated to reconnecting communities that were previously cut off from economic opportunities by highways and other transportation infrastructure. Reconnecting a community could mean adapting existing infrastructure—such as building a pedestrian walkway over or under an existing highway—to better connect neighborhoods to opportunities or better means of access such as crosswalks and redesigned intersections.
“The Reconnecting Communities program will help right the wrongs of our past by connecting neighborhoods that were previously divided by highways and other infrastructure,” continued Sewell. “This is about making sure that people can live where they want to live more affordably while accessing the jobs, schools, and services our city has to offer. I applaud Secretary Buttigieg and the entire Biden-Harris Administration for making these investments which harness the power of transportation infrastructure to connect our communities and build a more equitable future.”
""Transportation can connect us to jobs, services, and loved ones, but we‘ve also seen countless cases around the country where a piece of infrastructure cuts off a neighborhood or a community because of how it was built,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. ""Using funds from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are proud to announce the launch of Reconnecting Communities: the first-ever dedicated federal initiative to unify neighborhoods living with the impacts of past infrastructure choices that divided them.""
Secretary Buttigieg also visited the 16th Street Baptist Church to connect with other community leaders and learn about the church’s history and role in catalyzing the Civil Rights Movement.

25,Economy,Rep. Sewell Continues her Congress in Your Community Tour with Stops at Westervelt Lumber and Thomasville Regional Medical Center,"June 28, 2022","Thomasville, AL – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) continued her Congress in Your Community Tour in Thomasville, Alabama. Rep. Sewell began by visiting Thomasville’s Westervelt Lumber Mill where she toured the facility and spoke with employees during a town hall event. She then toured the Thomasville Regional Medical Center and met with the facility's leadership to help address their urgent funding needs.
After arriving at Westervelt Lumber’s Thomasville Mill, Rep. Sewell spoke with the facility's employees during a town hall event and provided an update on her bipartisan legislation, the Disaster Reforestation Act, which would help the lumber industry recover following a natural disaster. Sewell then toured the facility for a firsthand look at Westervelt’s work which serves customers across the United States.
“I know just how critical the timber industry is to Alabama’s 7th Congressional District and to the State of Alabama,” said Rep. Sewell. “I want to thank Westervelt Lumber for bringing jobs, opportunities, and investments right here to our Clarke County community.” 
“I also know companies like Westervelt face an immense financial burden when natural disasters damage our forests,” continued Sewell. “We must ensure that our tax code allows businesses to recover when disaster strikes, which is why I’m proud to be leading the bipartisan Disaster Reforestation Act in the House of Representatives. This bill would provide needed relief to this critical industry, allowing companies to claim losses of uncut timber from fire, storms, insects, invasive species, drought, or theft.”
“The Westervelt Company was pleased to welcome Congresswoman Sewell to our Thomasville Lumber facility today,” said Westervelt President and CEO Brian Luoma. “We appreciate her support on issues important to our industry, including the benefits of managed forests and the economic impact to our local communities.”
Following her stop at Westervelt Lumber, Sewell visited the Thomasville Regional Medical Center where she met with hospital officials about how she can best support efforts to keep the hospital open. For months, Rep. Sewell has been strongly advocating for critically-needed federal support to address the hospital’s urgent financial situation. During today’s visit, she reiterated her commitment to supporting the hospital which serves as a critical resource for those living in the Black Belt.
“The residents of Thomasville, Clarke County, and the Black Belt depend on the Thomasville Regional Medical Center for lifesaving care,” said Rep. Sewell. “I, along with Mayor Day, have been working tirelessly to find solutions that would address the hospital’s urgent financial needs. I want my constituents to know that I am committed to doing everything in my power to assist the Thomasville Regional Medical Center so that it can continue to serve this community.”
“We are fortunate to have Congresswoman Sewell on our team,” said Thomasville Mayor Sheldon Day. “She has been an integral part of our efforts to improve our community and to raise the level of health care throughout the Black Belt. Her assistance and leadership in attracting jobs to the area through companies such as Westervelt has been invaluable. We are grateful she spent time with us in Thomasville today.”

26,Economy,Rep. Sewell Fights Inflation by Voting to Lower Food and Fuel Costs,"June 16, 2022","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted for new bipartisan legislation to lower the cost of food and fuel, another step forward in House Democrats’ fight against inflation. The Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act will help bring down prices for Alabamians in the grocery store and at the gas pump by giving American farmers and ranchers the support they need to thrive.
“Today, I proudly voted for more strong action to fight inflation and bring down costs for Alabamians,” said Rep. Sewell. “Putin’s war in Ukraine is driving up the cost of fuel and food all over the world. But by lowering costs for America’s farmers, we can lower costs for families in the grocery store. I want my constituents to know that President Biden and Congressional Democrats remain laser-focused on bringing down costs for families in Alabama and across the country.”
The Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act takes three steps to lower costs for America’s families: 

Lower Fertilizer Costs in the Field to Lower Food Prices in the Grocery Store. Russia and Ukraine are major global producers of key components of fertilizer, and Putin’s war has dramatically driven up the costs of fertilizer for American farmers – in turn, driving up prices in the grocery store too. The Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act reduces our dependence on foreign fertilizer production and includes two bipartisan bills to help American farmers lower their costs with $500 million in USDA funds as well as loan guarantees to pay for solutions, including precision agriculture, to use fertilizers more efficiently. Lower costs for farmers mean lower costs for families.
Lower Meat and Poultry Costs by Increasing Meatpacking Competition and Capacity. Unfair, anti-competitive practices by the major meatpacking conglomerates who dominate the market are driving up the price of meat and poultry in the supermarket even as many of the men and women who raise the beef, pork and chicken are forced to accept prices that make it almost impossible to make ends meet. The Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act strengthens competition in the meat and poultry sector and alleviates the supply chain bottlenecks that let meatpacking conglomerates set bad prices for producers and consumers alike. The bill includes the bipartisan Butcher Block Act to expand and create new meat processing capacity and options to market cattle, as well as the bipartisan Meat & Poultry Special Investigator Act, establishing a USDA Special Investigator for Competition Matters with new powers to swiftly crack down on anti-competitive practices by meatpacking conglomerates in violation of the long-standing Packers and Stockyards Act. Better enforcement will lead to greater competition in meat processing, fairer access to markets for producers and more price stability for consumers.
Lower Prices at the Pump by Making Cheaper, Cleaner Unleaded 88 More Available. Homegrown American ethanol grown by American farmers is one of our most powerful tools to fight Putin’s Price Hike on American families, and nextgen biofuels infrastructure can make it even cleaner and more efficient to produce. Unleaded 88 is a cleaner, typically cheaper fuel option that costs on average approximately 40 cents less per gallon, emits less carbon pollution and burns cleaner than regular gas. The Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act expands access to lower-cost Unleaded 88 and taps the power of American farmers to break the grip of foreign autocrats weaponizing the price of oil and gas. The bill includes the bipartisan Year-Round Fuel Choice Act, which builds on the Biden Administration’s action allowing for the voluntary year-round sale of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol, known as E-15 or Unleaded 88. The bill also includes the bipartisan Renewable Fuel Infrastructure Investment and Market Expansion Act, which invests $200 million to help deploy additional storage and dispensing equipment to ensure that higher ethanol blends, biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel and other biofuels are more readily available across the country.

The Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act builds on House Democrats’ ongoing work to strengthen supply chains and bring down costs for working families. Earlier this week, the Congress passed the Ocean Shipping Reform Act to ease the burden of rising costs for consumers, retailers and farmers by cracking down on exorbitant shipping fees. The House previously passed the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act to combat Big Oil’s excessive gas price hikes. Meanwhile, the House and Senate are continuing to advance a bold competitiveness package that will lower costs by reinvigorating American manufacturing while strengthening our supply chains.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
27,Economy,"Rep. Sewell Votes for Workforce Investments to Fill Job Openings, Lower Costs","May 17, 2022","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Sewell (AL-07) voted to reauthorize the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), legislation that will help unleash the full potential of Alabama’s workforce by ensuring Alabamians have the skills they need to succeed. Amid the strongest job growth in modern times, these investments will connect Alabamians to a record number of job openings—bringing workers off the sidelines, increasing production, and lowering the cost of key goods.
“Today, I proudly voted to invest in Alabama’s workforce, which is the cornerstone of economic growth and prosperity in our state,” said Rep. Sewell. “By fully funding our federal workforce development system, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will deliver high-quality job training and empower Alabamians to take advantage of record job growth we’re experiencing under President Biden. By getting people in jobs, this legislation will help bolster Alabama’s manufacturing base and lower costs for hardworking Alabama families.” 
WIOA makes up the heart of the United States’ workforce development system, but its Congressional authorization has not been renewed since lapsing in 2020. Additionally, while the U.S. labor force has grown by roughly half over the past four decades, federal workforce development spending has fallen by two thirds. This funding gap means that essential job training services are frequently unavailable to Alabamians who need them most.
Today’s reauthorization fully funds WIOA for six years, allowing the workforce development system to train one million American workers per year by 2028. Additionally, it further expands pathways to opportunity by strengthening the Job Corps program, supporting summer and year-round jobs programs for young people and establishing a new employment program for formerly incarcerated Americans. By helping fill a record number of job openings, these workforce development investments will power the economy and lower costs for working families. 
In order to further address good shortages and rising prices, the House passed the America COMPETES Act earlier this year. This legislation will deliver transformative investments to strengthen the United States’ broken supply chains, reinvigorate American manufacturing and boost production across key industries. The Congress is now working to deliver a final bipartisan, bicameral supply chain package to the President’s desk.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
28,Economy,Rep. Sewell Announces Over $4.2 Million in Department of Labor Grants for the Greater Birmingham Region,"April 25, 2022","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that the greater Birmingham region will receive over $4.2 million in grant funding from the United States Department of Labor (DOL) for job training and educational opportunities for at-risk youth. This funding, which was awarded through DOL’s YouthBuild program, will be used to support the development of apprenticeship and other career pathway models that prepare at-risk youth for jobs in construction and other in-demand industries, especially clean energy. The awards are part of a $90 million investment by the Biden-Harris Administration to grow America’s clean energy workforce with education and training for young adults.
The following organizations were named as recipients of DOL’s YouthBuild grant program:

Bessemer Housing Authority - $1,500,000
Housing Authority of Birmingham District (HABD) - $1,500,000
Cornerstone Revitalization Foundation - $1,259,237

“I’m thrilled that the greater Birmingham region will be receiving over $4.2 million from the Department of Labor!” said Rep. Sewell. “This announcement is truly a win-win for our community. By connecting at-risk youth with job training and education, this funding will provide our most vulnerable young adults with the resources they need to succeed, all while growing our green energy workforce. Once again, I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration for making transformational investments in our community!” 
“We are delighted to be awarded the Department of Labor YouthBuild Grant to help provide the youth of Bessemer, Alabama with additional resources, furthering their education and preparing them to become productive citizens in our community,” said Courtney Coleman, Executive Director of the Bessemer Housing Authority. “We believe these funds along with our community partners will work together to ‘Build Better Lives’ and ‘Deliver Hope’, which is the mission here at the Bessemer Housing Authority.”
“This is a monumental win for our agency,” said HABD Board Chairman Dr. Anthony Hood. “This award allows us to equip our most promising youth with the tools needed to thrive in an ever-competitive workforce. The demand for skilled trades and apprenticeships has never been stronger, and this grant allows us to place our young people on a direct path to the careers of the future.""
“Often, when a child drops out of school, society takes it as a sign that they have given up hope that life can get any better for them. This grant allows us to seek out those youth and give that hope back to them,” said HABD Interim President and CEO Dontrelle Young Foster. “With this award, HABD can prepare residents for quality jobs and promote the attainment of skills necessary for success in this knowledge-based economy. This is a win not only for the clients we serve at HABD but also for the entire City of Birmingham. ""
Following its Nov. 23, 2021 announcement of available funding, DOL awarded 68 grants—ranging from $700,000 to $1.5 million—to organizations in 28 states and Puerto Rico to deliver job training and employment services. Participants will engage in classroom learning that will prepare them for work-based learning opportunities building and rehabilitating affordable housing for low-income or homeless families in their communities.
Participants will split their time between workplace training and the classroom, where they will earn a high school diploma or equivalent degree to prepare for postsecondary opportunities.
Administered by the department's Employment and Training Administration, the latest YouthBuild grants complement the Biden-Harris administration's workforce priorities to advance equitable career pathway opportunities, quality jobs and climate sustainability by supporting programs that provide construction skills focused on green building techniques, including understanding sustainable building materials, solar panel installation, weatherization processes and the use of Energy Star appliances. These announcements will also further President Biden's Justice40 Initiative that commits to delivering at least 40 percent of the benefits from federal climate and clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities.
For the first time, the YouthBuild funding opportunity announcement included criteria that awarded bonus points for applicants that demonstrated their ability to provide training in green construction techniques, training the next generation of workers for resilience and clean energy careers of the future.
YouthBuild programs also train young people for employment in healthcare, information technology, manufacturing and logistics, culinary arts, and hospitality.

Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to secure urgently needed relief for small businesses across Alabama. H.R. 3807, the Relief for Restaurants & Other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act, will deliver $55 billion to replenish relief funding for restaurants and establish a new program supporting other small businesses impacted by the pandemic. The bill passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 223-203.
“Small businesses are the lifeblood of Alabama’s economy,” said Rep. Sewell. “Today, House Democrats are once again taking action to support small businesses that were hit hardest by the pandemic. The Restaurant Revitalization Fund, which we created in the historic American Rescue Plan, has served as a lifeline for Alabama’s restaurants and small businesses, providing over $150 million in relief. Today’s legislation builds on our progress with additional funding for these establishments to ensure they can continue to reopen, recover, and rehire. As we build a better Alabama, I will continue to make supporting our small businesses a top priority!”
The Relief for Restaurants & Other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act delivers critical assistance to small businesses in three ways:

Replenishes the Restaurant Revitalization Fund to rescue struggling establishments - Established through Democrats’ American Rescue Plan, which Sewell helped pass, the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) distributed $28.6 billion to restaurants across the country – including $154,096,761 for 866 small businesses in Alabama. Due to its popularity, the program quickly exhausted its funding before more than 170,000 eligible businesses could access relief. The Relief for Restaurants & Other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act will provide $42 billion to replenish the RRF so that these restaurants can apply for this assistance. 
Helps ensure that the hardest hit small businesses don’t get left out - H.R. 3807 provides $13 billion to establish the new Hard Hit Industries Award Program, an SBA initiative to assist small businesses from across industries that were hardest hit by the pandemic and lost revenue but were not eligible for other grants or awards. Businesses eligible for these grants would have 200 or fewer employees and have experienced 40 percent or more in lost revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Provides much-needed flexibility to theaters, performing arts centers, and other venues to expend relief funds - The bill amends the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant Program by extending the timeframe that current award recipients are required to incur expenses and expend grant funds

This legislation is paid for responsibly and is funded in part by transferring funds that are reclaimed, seized, or returned to the Federal Government primarily from bad actors attempting to defraud prior small business pandemic relief funds including the Paycheck Protection Program, Shuttered Venue Operators Grant Program, COVID EIDL loans and others.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
30,Economy,Rep. Sewell Announces Over $76 Million for Alabama Transit Projects,"April 7, 2022","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law she helped pass will invest $76,383,752 this year to upgrade and expand local transit in Alabama. $11,791,104 of these funds have been allocated for local transit projects in Birmingham and $4,124,766 for local transit projects in Montgomery. This investment will allow local transit authorities to buy new buses and railcars, address repair backlogs, modernize fleets, and transition to new technologies that reduce carbon emissions.
“Today’s announcement is yet another example of how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is delivering for Alabamians.” said Rep. Sewell. “Alabama’s transit systems are in dire need of repair. This funding, which I was proud to help secure, will help us upgrade and expand our transit systems to reduce commute times and help connect our communities, all while creating good-paying jobs.”
Funding from today’s announcement will create even more good-paying manufacturing jobs, in addition to the 2,900 manufacturing jobs already created in Alabama under President Biden.

31,Economy,Rep. Sewell Celebrates Passage of Her Legislation to Make it Easier for Part-Time Workers to Save for Retirement,"March 30, 2022","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) lauded the passage of the Securing a Strong Retirement Act—also known as the SECURE Act 2.0—in the House of Representatives. This robust retirement savings package, which passed yesterday by a bipartisan vote of 414-5, includes H.R. 2944, a bill that Sewell introduced to make it easier for part-time workers to start contributing to their employer’s 401k plan. Sewell’s bill incentivizes saving by reducing the number of years of service required for part-time workers to make retirement contributions. As women are more likely to work part-time than men, this provision is particularly impactful for women in the workforce.
“We know that Alabama’s working families are facing a retirement crisis,” said Rep. Sewell. “Too often, incentives to save are designed to benefit the wealthy and the upper-middle class, leaving many families without adequate savings even after a lifetime of work. My bill addresses this fundamental inequity in our tax code by rebalancing incentives to save and making it easier for part-time workers to save sooner in their careers. I’m thrilled that this bill passed the House and will continue to advance policies that ensure all working people can retire with dignity and financial security!”
H.R. 2944, the Reducing the Maximum Service Requirement for Long-term Part-time Workers to Make Elective Deferrals to 401(k) Plans Act, amends the long-term part-time years of service 401(k) participation requirement included in the 2019 SECURE Act. The SECURE Act provides that except in the case of collectively bargained plans, employers maintaining a 401(k) plan must have a dual eligibility requirement under which an employee must complete either a one year of service requirement (with the 1,000-hour rule) or three consecutive years of service where the employee completes at least 500 hours of service. H.R. 2944 reduces the three-year rule to two years, allowing for part-time employees to begin saving for retirement sooner.

Terri Sewell (AL-07) kicked off the second leg of her “Building a Better Alabama” Infrastructure District Tour with a stop at the Montgomery Regional Airport (MGM) to highlight the transformational funding from President Biden’s $1 trillion bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Sewell was the only member of the Alabama Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of the law which will deliver $140 million to Alabama’s airports for infrastructure development over the next five years.
“Alabama’s airports help keep our communities connected and play a critical role in the economic well-being of our state,” said Rep. Sewell. “We must ensure they have the resources they need to deliver safe and efficient air travel for Alabamians and visitors alike. I’m so proud to stand here at the Montgomery Regional Airport to announce that Alabama’s airports will receive $140 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which I was proud to help pass. Together, we’re building a better Alabama for all our people!”
“The Montgomery Regional Airport is an important economic engine for the city and county, and we appreciate Congresswoman Terri Sewell’s commitment to improving the airport’s infrastructure and future improvement projects,” said MGM Executive Director, Wade A. Davis. “Her dedicated support will ensure that all travelers flying to and from the Montgomery region will have an easier and safer journey.”
Sewell began with a tour of the airport before hosting a press conference with MGM Executive Director Wade Davis and several stakeholders to highlight the over $140 million in federal funding included in the infrastructure law that will help improve Alabama’s airports over five years. 
Nationally, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will invest:

33,Economy,"Rep. Sewell Announces Alabama Gained 5,500 Manufacturing Jobs in 2021","February 17, 2022","Birmingham, AL – Today, Rep. Sewell announced Alabama has added 5,500 manufacturing jobs, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Rep. Sewell helped local manufacturers create and restore jobs by passing the American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Sewell continues working to help Alabama create even more jobs by passing the America COMPETES Act which will strengthen our supply chains and start making more critical domestic products here in the U.S.
“This week’s jobs report shows that our economic plan, in partnership with President Biden, is working and we are getting Alabamians back to work,” said Rep. Sewell. “Together, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the America COMPETES Act will build off the momentum of the American Rescue Plan, creating millions more good-paying jobs by rebuilding America’s infrastructure and investing in U.S. manufacturing.”
Under President Biden, the U.S. has created 375,000 manufacturing jobs and a total of 6.6 million jobs nationwide. Notably, almost every state added manufacturing jobs in the first 11 months after President Biden came into office. By comparison, the entire U.S. economy added just 2,000 manufacturing jobs in 2019—including only 200 in Alabama—under the previous administration.

34,Economy,Rep. Sewell Announces Millions from First Round of New Transit Funding Headed to Alabama Under Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,"February 10, 2022","Washington, D.C. – This week, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that the first round of new federal transit funding under the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is heading to Alabama to strengthen public transportation systems, support transit jobs across the state, and make urgently-needed investments, including new bus and railcar acquisitions, facility upgrades and other key projects.
“The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is continuing to deliver for Alabama!” celebrated Rep. Sewell. “This transformative legislation includes the largest transit investment in American history, with billions coming to Alabama to improve reliability and support good-paying jobs. This week’s announcement of the first round of transit funding is a critical victory for our economy and I am committed to working with our state and local leaders to ensure that Alabamians feel the benefits of these investments.”
Transit systems have suffered from decades of underinvestment, causing disruptions and increasing travel times for passengers. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, signed by President Biden in November 2021, represents the largest-ever investment in America’s public transit. For Alabama this first round of transit funding includes:

$18,210,370 in flexible funding to help communities make transit safer and more efficient, funding new buses and rail cars, track and station repairs, and other safety initiatives.
$3,437,118 to upgrade bus fleets and repair old buses and bus facilities.
At least $2,413,467 to support transit for seniors and persons with disabilities, funding key resources such as wheelchair lifts, mobility management programs, and accessible transit vehicles.

These investments, administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Transit Administration, total nearly $6 billion in funding that will be made available to transit agencies, states and Tribal governments across the country for the first 4.5 months of fiscal year 2022.  Additional funding will become available following passage of a full-year appropriations bill, which is currently being negotiated in the House and Senate.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
35,Economy,"Rep. Sewell Votes for Legislation to Super-Charge American Competitiveness with Bold Investments in Research, Innovation, and American Manufacturing","February 4, 2022","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass the America COMPETES Act, comprehensive and strategic legislation that will super-charge America’s competitiveness and position our nation to compete – and win – on the world stage. The package, which passed the House today by a vote of 222 to 210, fixes our supply chains by strengthening U.S. manufacturing, makes bold investments in American scientific research, technology, and innovation, and bolsters America’s leadership and competitiveness across the globe. Rep. Sewell’s Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 was included in this bill which would modernize U.S. trade laws and protect American jobs by combating China’s anti-free market practices.
“Ensuring that America can compete and WIN on the world stage is critically important,” said Rep. Sewell. “The America COMPETES Act will do just that, super-charging American competitiveness with bold investments in research, innovation, and American manufacturing.”
“I'm so proud that my bipartisan Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 was included in this bill, which will modernize our outdated trade laws and push back against China’s most egregious anti-free market practices,” continued Sewell. “This bill is about standing up to China and protecting good-paying American jobs, and I thank my Republican colleague Rep. Bill Johnson for co-leading this transformative legislation with me.”
Rep. Sewell’s Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0, which she introduced in December 2021, would strengthen U.S. trade remedy laws to protect American workers and combat China’s unfair, anti-free market trade practices that distort the global market. The Level the Playing Field Act 2.0 enjoys strong support from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), the United Steelworkers, and steel manufacturers in Alabama.
The America COMPETES Act will super-charge American innovation and competitiveness by:

Making bold investments in semiconductor chips: with $52 billion to support U.S. production of semiconductors — a key component in consumer electronics, cars, defense systems and other key products — address supply chain disruptions that push up costs for families, bring back chips production to America and ensure that the U.S. leads the way on semiconductor fabrication.
Strengthening supply chains and manufacturing at home: with $45 billion to support the manufacture and acquisition of critical goods or industrial equipment that are essential for national security and economic vitality – including public health and biological preparedness, information and communications technology, the energy and transportation sector’s industrial base, and agricultural commodities and food product supply chains.  COMPETES reduces our reliance on critical goods from countries of concern and encourages the relocation of manufacturing facilities out of these countries.
Advancing American scientific research and innovation excellence: ensure that we lead the technologies of the future with a suite of bipartisan science, research and technology bills to turbocharge American innovation, focused squarely on producing solutions and results. COMPETES also maximizes the American talent pool by strengthening and diversifying our nation’s STEM workforce.
Promoting U.S. global leadership: positioning the interests and values of the United States, not China, to win on the world stage, including with strong action to hold the PRC accountable for its trade abuses, which hurt U.S. workers, and for its human rights violations, including the genocide against the Uyghurs.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
36,Economy,"Rep. Sewell Welcomes Deputy Agriculture Secretary and Undersecretary for Rural Development to Bessemer, Announces $360 Million for Medical West Hospital","January 26, 2022","Bessemer, AL – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) welcomed U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Deputy Secretary Jewel Bronaugh and Undersecretary for Rural Development Xochitl Torres Small to Medical West Hospital in Bessemer. The visit began with a roundtable where Sewell joined officials from the USDA, Jefferson County Commission, and UAB Medical West Hospital to discuss how they can collaborate to strengthen and expand access to health care for rural communities. Following their discussion, Deputy Secretary Bronaugh announced more than $1 billion in investments by the USDA that will transform rural areas across the country, including $360 million for the construction of the Medical West Hospital in Bessemer. This funding will increase access to health care, education, and public safety while spurring community development and building sound infrastructure for people living in rural communities.
Bessemer’s Medical West Hospital Authority will use this $360 million Community Facilities Direct Loan, announced today, to build a state-of-the-art, 200-bed hospital. It will feature a 26-room emergency department, 12 operating rooms, eight labor and delivery rooms, and eight multi-purpose rooms. This 405,186- square-foot facility will be strategically located to serve rural west Jefferson County, rural west Tuscaloosa County and other surrounding rural communities. This project will benefit approximately 333,000 rural people in these communities. 
“I was so pleased to welcome USDA Deputy Secretary Bronaugh and Undersecretary Torres Small to Alabama today!” said Rep. Sewell. “I want to thank them and the rest of the Biden-Harris Administration for their commitment to Alabama’s 7th Congressional District and for bringing transformational investments like this right here to our doorstep. Thanks to this $360 million investment, the construction of Medical West Hospital in Bessemer will expand access to critical health care services for thousands of residents in Jefferson and Tuscaloosa Counties and the surrounding rural communities.”
“The Biden-Harris Administration has made investing in infrastructure improvements a top priority,” said Deputy Secretary Bronaugh. “These loans and grants will help rural communities invest in facilities and services that are vital to all communities, such as health care facilities, schools, libraries, and first responder vehicles and equipment. When we invest in essential services in rural America, we build opportunity and prosperity for the people who call rural communities home.”
The construction of Medical West Hospital is one of 737 projects that USDA is helping fund through five programs to help rural America build back better, stronger and more equitably than ever before. These programs include Community Facilities Direct Loans and Grants, Community Facilities Loan Guarantees, Community Facilities Technical Assistance Training Grants, Community Facilities Disaster Grants, and Economic Impact Initiative Grants. The projects will finance emergency response vehicles and equipment; build or improve hospitals and clinics and help fund other essential community facilities. Bronaugh underscored the critical role that Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, Vice Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations, had in fighting for additional funding for the Community Facilities Direct Loans, which made many of these investments in critical rural infrastructure possible.   
Under the Biden-Harris Administration, Rural Development provides loans and grants to help expand economic opportunities, create jobs and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans in rural areas. This assistance supports infrastructure improvements; business development; housing; community facilities such as schools, public safety and health care; and high-speed internet access in rural, Tribal and high-poverty areas.

Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that the Downtown Selma River Stabilization Project will receive $803,000 in new funding from President Biden’s bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to help the City of Selma address the severe river erosion that threatens the stability of the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge as well as many buildings adjacent to the Alabama River. This new federal investment comes as the Biden Administration and Congresswoman Sewell continue their focus on improving infrastructure resilience and creating jobs for families.
“Every year, public officials, Foot Soldiers, faith leaders, student groups, and community activists travel to Selma, Alabama, to commemorate the anniversary of Bloody Sunday. As we continue the fight for voting rights, the City of Selma and the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge now and forever stand as a symbol for equality, justice, and civil rights,” said Rep. Sewell. “However, the Edmund Pettus Bridge and the buildings in Downtown Selma adjacent to the Alabama river are under threat from the severe river erosion caused by multiple natural disasters. Thanks to our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, $803,000 is soon headed to Selma.” 
With these new federal funds from the Army Corps, officials will be able to complete preconstruction engineering and design of the stabilization project and ultimately expedite completion of the project.
The Biden Administration announced yesterday that the Army Corps of Engineers will invest $14 billion in 500 projects across the nation that focus on strengthening critical supply chains.  Due to decades of underinvestment, and accelerating climate threats, supply chains have struggled to keep pace with the strong economic recovery – burdening families and businesses with added costs and delay. These new investments will create jobs and economic opportunity, while strengthening key water infrastructure projects, improving resilience to the climate crisis, and restoring the environment.

Terri Sewell (AL-07) concluded the first leg of her “Building a Better Alabama” Infrastructure District Tour, stopping in Marengo and Sumter Counties to highlight the transformational funding from the $1.2 trillion bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. 
“The first leg of my Infrastructure District Tour was a great success and I look forward to continuing my travel to alert our communities of the transformational infrastructure funding coming their way!” said Rep. Sewell. “By visiting our communities and speaking with constituents and local officials, I am prepared to leverage our collective resources to ensure that infrastructure projects in our district receive the funding and prioritization they deserve.” 
Sewell began the day in Demopolis with a visit to Whitfield Regional Hospital followed by a press conference to discuss the healthcare provisions in the Build Back Better Act and how federal funding from various pieces of legislation have helped support hospitals by keeping first responders, frontline health workers, and other providers of vital services safely on the job. She took the opportunity to thank frontline workers for fighting to keep residents of the 7th District safe and healthy during the pandemic.
She then visited Carl Turk County Road 12 in Livingston to highlight the over $6 billion in federal funding for Alabama included in the infrastructure law that will help fix Alabama’s roads and reduce the backlog of major repairs for highways and bridges in Alabama. 
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will:

Create Millions of Good-Paying Jobs - Together with the Build Back Better Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will create an average of 2 million jobs per year over the course of the next decade. 
Repair and Rebuild Alabama’s Roads and Bridges - The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Alabama would expect to receive:

$5.2 billion for federal-aid highway apportioned programs
$225 million for bridge replacement and repairs under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act over five years. 


Connect Every Alabamian to High-speed Internet - Broadband internet is necessary for Alabamians to do their jobs, participate equally in school learning, health care, and to stay connected. Yet 18% of Alabama households do not have an internet subscription, and 11.5% of Alabama residents live in areas where, under the FCC’s benchmark, there is no broadband infrastructure. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Alabama will receive a minimum allocation of $100 million to help provide broadband coverage across the state, including providing access to the at least 565,000 Alabamians who currently lack it. It also makes 1,518,000 Alabamians (31%) eligible for the Affordability Connectivity Benefit, which will help low-income families afford internet access.
Make Transformational Investments in Alabama’s Water Infrastructure - Currently, up to 10 million American households and 400,000 schools and child care centers lack safe drinking water. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, based on the traditional state revolving fund formula, Alabama will expect to receive $782 million over five years to improve water infrastructure across the state and ensure that clean, safe drinking water is a right in all communities. The bill also includes $23 billion nationally for the bipartisan Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act.
Improve Healthy, Sustainable Transportation Options - Alabamians who take public transportation spend an extra 66.2% of their time commuting and non-White households are 4.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation. 25% of transit vehicles in the state are past useful life. Based on formula funding alone, Alabama would expect to receive more than $400 million over five years under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to improve public transportation options across the state.

Alabama can also compete for the $12.5 billion Bridge Investment Program for economically significant bridges and nearly $16 billion of national funding in the bill dedicated for major projects that will deliver substantial economic benefits to communities.

Background on H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act:
On August 24, 2021, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which Rep. Sewell introduced earlier in the month. On November 3, 2021, nearly every Senate Republican blocked debate on the Senate version of the bill.
This critical legislation would restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and keep the promise of our democracy alive for all Americans. Amid the most coordinated state-level effort to restrict the right to vote in generations, H.R. 4 would prevent states and localities with a recent history of voter discrimination from restricting the right to vote by requiring these jurisdictions to obtain federal preclearance before changing their voting laws.

Connect Every Alabamian to High-speed Internet - Broadband internet is necessary for Alabamians to do their jobs, participate equally in school learning, health care, and to stay connected. Yet 18% of Alabama households do not have an internet subscription, and 11.5% of Alabama residents live in areas where, under the FCC’s benchmark, there is no broadband infrastructure. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Alabama will receive a minimum allocation of $100 million to help provide broadband coverage across the state, including providing access to the at least 565,000 Alabamians who currently lack it. It also makes 1,518,000 Alabamians (31%) eligible for the Affordability Connectivity Benefit, which will help low-income families afford internet access.
Make Transformational Investments in Alabama’s Water Infrastructure - Currently, up to 10 million American households and 400,000 schools and child care centers lack safe drinking water. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, based on the traditional state revolving fund formula, Alabama will expect to receive $782 million over five years to improve water infrastructure across the state and ensure that clean, safe drinking water is a right in all communities. The bill also includes $23 billionnationally for the bipartisan Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act.
Improve Healthy, Sustainable Transportation Options - Alabamians who take public transportation spend an extra 66.2% of their time commuting and non-White households are 4.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation. 25% of transit vehicles in the state are past useful life. Based on formula funding alone, Alabama would expect to receive more than $400 million over five years under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to improve public transportation options across the state.

Alabama can also compete for the $12.5 billion Bridge Investment Program for economically significant bridges and nearly $16 billion of national funding in the bill dedicated for major projects that will deliver substantial economic benefits to communities.

42,Economy,"Rep. Sewell Votes to Protect the Full Faith and Credit of the United States, Avert Catastrophic Default","December 14, 2021","Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to address the nation’s debt limit. Doing so protects the full faith and credit of the United States and averts economic catastrophe from the county’s first-ever credit default.
“Members of Congress should never play politics with the full faith and credit of the United States,” said Rep. Sewell. “We have an obligation to pay our bills that have piled up under previous administrations including President Trump's. Addressing the debt limit is the responsible thing to do, and I was proud to join my Democratic colleagues to protect families from catastrophe and pay our bills.”
Notably, raising the debt limit does not authorize future spending.  It is about meeting obligations the government has already made, including to Social Security recipients, veterans and to the millions who have benefited from the bipartisan COVID relief legislation passed in December – which was authored by multiple GOP Senators and voted for by more than 40 Republicans and signed into law by the previous president.  
Protecting the full faith and credit of the United States has long been a bipartisan responsibility of the Congress.  Congress has addressed the debt limit nearly 80 times since 1960: 30 times with a Democrat in the White House and 49 times under a Republican president:

Democrats helped to raise the debt ceiling three times under the Trump Administration, even while Republicans used reconciliation to add $2 trillion to the debt with their GOP tax giveaway for the rich.
Republicans supported suspending the debt limit all three times that it needed to be addressed in the last Administration, when the debt rose by $7.8 trillion.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
43,Economy,"Rep. Sewell Applauds Globe Metallurgical Inc. on Re-opening the Silicon Plant in Selma, AL in January 2022","December 14, 2021","Selma, AL - Today, Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) applauded Globe Metallurgical Inc. on the re-opening of the silicon plant in Selma, Alabama in January 2022. An allocation from the New Markets Tax Credit Program is also being pursued to enable an expansion of planned capabilities and upgrade of equipment, making the plant more efficient and competitive in the global market. 
“I'm thrilled that Globe Metallurgical Inc. is reopening its silicon metal facility in my hometown of Selma!” said Rep. Sewell. “Manufacturing facilities are economic pillars in our community. I applaud everyone for their continued work in promoting growth and economic opportunity through high-quality jobs to residents in Selma and across the Black Belt.”
Background:
The Selma plant closed in 2018 due to low prices for silicon metal caused by foreign dumping.
As a result of an increased demand and rise of prices, the plant in Selma reopened in November 2021. Globe Metallurgical, Inc. spent millions of dollars refurbishing the plant, aided by the Dallas County Commission and the State of Alabama in preparation for the plant’s reopening in January 2022.Additionally, the company hopes to secure federal New Market Tax Credits, which will enable further investment and an expansion of capabilities in the Selma operation.
At full production, the facility will employ around 100 people in the region and will do business with 150 local suppliers. The two-furnace operation can produce up to 22,000 tons of silicon metal a year. The plant plans to restart the first furnace in January 2022, soon followed by a complete ramp-up to full operational capacity.
Globe Metallurgical, Inc is a subsidiary of Ferroglobe PLC.  Ferroglobe is one of the world’s leading suppliers of silicon metal, silicon- and manganese- based specialty alloys, and ferroalloys, serving a customer base across the globe in dynamic and fast-growing end markets, such as solar, semiconductors, automotive, consumer products, construction, and energy. The Company is based in London. For more information, visit http://investor.ferroglobe.com.
“The restart of the Selma facility has been a part of our multi-year strategy,” said Ferroglobe Chief Executive Officer, Marco Levi. “We thank the many government officials who supported this effort and look forward to welcoming back the workforce.” 
“This has been a cooperative effort by The EDA, State of Alabama, Dallas County, and the City of Selma which includes Veronica Crock, Kelley Graham, Judge Jimmy Nunn, Mayor James Perkins Jr., and me,” said Selma and Dallas County Economic Development Authority Executive Director, Wayne Vardaman.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
44,Economy,Reps. Sewell Introduces Bipartisan Legislation to Help Small Businesses Rehire Workers Let Go Due to COVID-19,"December 7, 2021","Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (D-AL) joined Reps. Carol Miller (R-WV), Stephanie Murphy (D-FL), and Kevin Hern (R-OK) to introduce the Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) Reinstatement Act. The ERTC was designed to help small businesses rehire and retain employees they had to let go due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was overwhelmingly supported in the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed in March 2020.
“From our biggest cities to our rural towns, our nation’s small businesses help our communities thrive,” said Rep. Sewell. “As we build back better from the COVID-19 pandemic and grow our economy, we must make supporting our small business owners a top priority. By reinstating the Employee Retention Tax Credit, this bipartisan bill will provide much needed relief to Alabama’s small businesses, helping them rehire workers lost due to the pandemic. I was proud to join my colleagues in introducing this commonsense legislation and urge swift passage!”
“I’m pleased to lead my Ways and Means colleagues in introducing the Employee Retention Tax Credit Reinstatement Act,” said Rep. Carol Miller, lead Republican sponsor. “By reinstating the ERTC, struggling small businesses can access one of the last remaining pandemic recovery programs to receive the help they need to replenish their workforce and get back on track. As we continue to emerge from this public health emergency, we must remember that small businesses in West Virginia and across the country still need our support. I urge Congressional leaders and President Biden to pass our bill into law as soon as possible to give these businesses and employees the certainty they need.”
“Over the last year and a half I was proud to lead the bipartisan effort to establish the employee retention tax credit, which provides financial support to businesses who retain or rehire workers, rather than lay them off,” said Rep. Stephanie Murphy, lead Democratic co-sponsor. “This provision has helped thousands of businesses and their workers recover and rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic, and so my fellow Ways and Means colleagues and I are introducing this bipartisan legislation to ensure this program can continue and give small businesses and hardworking Americans the support they need.”
“Eliminating the Employee Retention Tax Credit was the wrong decision and hurts our small businesses who are still recovering from the economic fallout of the pandemic. We must provide certainty and predictability to American small business owners. I am proud to join my colleagues in support of this legislation and I hope to earn strong bipartisan support in the House,” said Rep. Kevin Hern, lead Republican co-sponsor.
Background:
Originally, to be eligible for the ERTC, business owners had to demonstrate at least a 20% decline in gross receipts in either a given quarter compared to the same quarter in 2019 or the immediately preceding quarter. Alternatively, the business owner may have been eligible if the business is subject to a full or partial suspension of business operations due to a government order.
Specifically, for this year’s third and fourth quarters, business owners can qualify for the ERTC as a “recovery startup business” or qualify as a “severely financially distressed employer.” To claim the ERTC as a “severely financially distressed employer,” the business must have suffered at least a 90% decline in gross receipts in a specific quarter compared to the same quarter in 2019.
Many small businesses have continued to take the tax credit into the fourth quarter, and now face a retroactive tax increase and a complex, frustrating process in reconciling the credit that they will now have to forfeit.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
45,Economy,"Reps. Sewell, Johnson Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Level the Playing Field for American Workers","December 2, 2021","Washington D.C. – Today, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Bill Johnson (OH-06) introduced bipartisan legislation to level the playing field for American workers. The Level the Playing Field Act 2.0 would strengthen U.S. trade remedy laws to protect American workers and combat China’s unfair, anti-free market trade practices that distort the global market.
“Protecting American workers and countering China’s unfair trade practices must be central pillars of U.S. trade policy,” said Rep. Sewell. “My Level the Playing Field Act 2.0 will support America’s workers by strengthening our trade remedy laws and promoting fair competition by pushing back against China’s egregious efforts to manipulate the global market in their favor. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Congressman Bill Johnson and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give it their full support!”
“For far too long, China and its communist regime have taken deliberate steps to hurt American workers and the American economy by dumping steel, aluminum, and other products on the global markets with no repercussions. That must end,” said Rep. Bill Johnson, lead Republican co-sponsor. “This bipartisan legislation will hold China accountable for these actions by ensuring that U.S. industries and the Department of Commerce have the tools needed to seek relief from China’s actions. A robust domestic steel and aluminum industry is critical to repairing America’s aging infrastructure and creating American jobs, the American economy, and American national security. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to ensure this bipartisan bill becomes law.”
The bill is  designed to combat many of China’s most egregious practices, such as:

Country Hopping to Escape U.S. Trade Remedies - After all the work of winning an anti-dumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) case, relief can be temporary as foreign producers move their factories to other countries to evade the AD/CVD orders. Title I of this legislation creates a new successive AD/CVD investigation to combat repeat offenders by making it easier for petitioners to bring new cases when production moves to another country. Title II outlines expedited timelines for successive investigations and factors for the International Trade Commission to consider about the relationship between recently completed trade cases and successive trade cases for the same imported product.
Belt and Road Initiative Subsidies - Currently, the Department of Commerce can only consider subsidies provided by the government under investigation. However, with the expansion of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, China is beginning to subsidize production in countries outside of China. Section 201 of this legislation would give Commerce the authority to apply CVD law to subsidies provided by a government to a company operating in a different country.
Circumventing U.S. Law - Section 301 of this legislation imposes statutory requirements for anti-circumvention inquiries to clarify the process and timeline. It also specifies the deadlines for preliminary and final determinations, which currently lack statutory deadlines.

The Level the Playing Field Act 2.0 enjoys strong support from the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), the United Steelworkers, and steel manufacturers in Alabama.
“This legislation will strengthen the effectiveness of the U.S. trade laws and will give American workers the confidence that their government has every potential tool available to fight for a level playing field against foreign competitors that seek to cheat the system,” said Kevin Dempsey, President and CEO of AISI. “The domestic steel industry appreciates the leadership of Congresswoman Sewell in introducing this critical legislation, which is a companion piece to the bipartisan measure introduced earlier this year by Senators Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman. We urge both Republicans and Democrats to support this crucial bill.”
Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Rob Portman (R-OH) introduced companion legislation in the Senate.

46,Economy,Rep. Sewell Welcomes Labor Secretary Marty Walsh to Birmingham,"November 22, 2021","Birmingham, AL – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) joined Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin in welcoming the U.S. Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh to Birmingham, Alabama. The visit was intended to promote the signing of President Biden’s Executive Order 14026 which increases the minimum wage to $15 per hour for federal contractors and the Biden-Harris Administration’s Build Back Better Agenda which includes historic investments in housing construction and rehabilitation, economic development, and community revitalization.
The day began with a visit of Innovation Depot, a startup ecosystem in Birmingham, where Mayor Woodfin, Sec. Walsh, and Rep. Sewell joined University of Alabama-Birmingham President Dr. Ray Watts, leadership from UAB, Innovate Birmingham, and Birmingham Promise for a tour of the facility. Here, they learned about the Birmingham Promise project which provides scholarships and apprenticeships to Birmingham City School students and heard testimonials from former and current students of Innovation Depot. 
Next, Rep. Sewell joined Sec. Walsh, Mayor Woodfin, and two local union workers for a rally in the historic Kelly Ingram Park to celebrate the signing of Executive Order 14026. This was followed by a tour of the park where Sec. Walsh saw the “Four Spirits” memorial to the four little girls who died in the 16th Street Church bombing in 1963. Secretary Walsh later toured the 16th Street Baptist Church. 
The visit concluded with a tour of The Dannon Project followed by a roundtable with the Mayor Woodfin, Sec. Walsh, Rep. Sewell, the Executive Director of The Dannon Project Kerri Pruitt, and the Alabama Secretary of Labor Fitzgerald Washington. 
Rep. Sewell’s remarks from today’s lunch at the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union’s Hall are included below:
I want to thank everyone for being here today, especially the Secretary of Labor Martin Walsh! Doesn’t he have great passion? I love it! You’re like a breath of fresh air, so thank you for being here Mr. Secretary! 
I want you to know that we’re going to continue fighting in Washington for everyday people. This president promised to deliver, and I am proud of the fact that he’s delivered on three major things. First, he said that he was going to pass the American Rescue Plan and give money directly to counties, cities, and essential workers. Which is exactly what he did in the American Rescue Plan. 
Secondly, he said that he would do infrastructure! The Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill 1.2 trillion dollars will create 2 million, good paying jobs every year in the United States of America. I want to thank all of you for your continued work. 
The third thing he promised to deliver on is the Build back Better Act that just passed the House of Representatives. This bill was not just about physical infrastructure, it was about social infrastructure and creating that social safety net to ensure that working families can really do what? Work!
That includes childcare, elder care, universal pre-k for our children and also healthcare. Your Congresswoman has been blessed that her bill is in that bill which would help the 12 states that did not expand Medicaid ensure that 300,000 Alabamians have quality health insurance. I will continue that fight. 
I’m also a proud supporter of the PRO Act, which ensures that unions can organize and collective bargain. This intimidation from management must STOP and I want to thank the Amazon workers of Alabama for leading the way on that.
In closing, Secretary Walsh, you are welcome to come back! We don’t only have the University of Alabama we have Auburn too. We have a lot of great football players but we also have southern hospitality that we are very, very proud of and that you will continue to experience today. 
Thank you! 
Background
Today’s events follow several significant milestones in the rollout of President Biden’s Build Back Better Agenda and the fight to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure.
Today, the Department of Labor announced the final rule to implement President Biden’s Executive Order 14026 to increase the hourly minimum wage on federal contracts beginning January 30, 2022. President Biden signed this executive order on April 27, 2021. 
The rule applies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and specified U.S. territories, and does the following:

Increases the hourly minimum wage for workers performing work on or in connection with covered federal contracts to $15 beginning Jan. 30, 2022.
Continues to index the federal contract minimum wage in future years to inflation.
Eliminates the tipped minimum wage for federal contract employees by 2024. 
Ensures a $15 minimum wage for workers with disabilities performing work on or in connection with covered contracts.
Restores minimum wage protections to outfitters and guides operating on federal lands. 

On Monday, November 15, President Biden signed the historic  Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the largest long-term investment in our country’s infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century. This investment will grow the economy, create good jobs, enhance our competitiveness, and make our economy more sustainable, resilient, and equitable. 
Thanks to the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act: : 

Alabama will receive $5.2 billion for federal-aid highway apportioned programs and $225 million for bridge replacement and repairs over five years.
Alabama will receive a minimum allocation of $100 million to help provide broadband coverage across the state.
The bill makes the largest investment in clean drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in American history, replacing all of the nation’s lead pipes and delivering clean water to millions of families.

On Friday November 19, the House of Representatives passed President Biden’s historic Build Back Better Act, once-in-a-generation legislation to lower costs for hard-working Alabamians, cut taxes for families and workers, and build an economy that puts working families first. The bill would:

Create millions of good-paying jobs together with the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
Cut taxes for families and workers by extending the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit.
Close the Medicaid coverage gap by extending through 2025 the enhanced premium subsidies in the ACA Marketplace that were included in the American Rescue Plan.
Expand Medicare with hearing coverage for seniors beginning on January 1, 2023.
Lower prescription drug costs by allowing the Secretary of HHS to negotiate certain drug prices and halting price hikes above inflation for all Americans. It also ensures that Americans with diabetes don’t pay more than $35 per month for their insulin.
Lower child care costs ensuring the vast majority of families do not pay more than seven percent of their income on child care.
Establish paid family and medical leave, providing four weeks of universal paid parental, family caregiving, and medical leave.
Provide universal, high-quality, free pre-K for every 3 and 4 year old in America.
Make the largest effort to combat climate change in American history, investing $555 billion over 10 years in clean energy and climate investments.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
47,Economy,Rep. Sewell Votes for President Biden’s Historic Build Back Better Act,"November 18, 2021","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass President Biden’s historic Build Back Better Act, once-in-a-generation legislation to lower costs for hard-working Alabamians, cut taxes for families and workers, and build an economy that puts working families first. Notably, it will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 per year. Among its many provisions, the bill would close the Medicaid coverage gap, create good-paying jobs, lower child care and health care costs, create universal pre-K, establish paid family and medical leave, reduce housing costs, and make the largest investment in combating the climate crisis in American history. The bill passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 220-213 and will now make its way to the U.S. Senate.
“Within six weeks of President Biden taking office, we passed the American Rescue Plan to save our economy, crush the pandemic, and deliver critical relief to Americans everywhere,” said Rep. Sewell. “Just last week, we delivered the largest investment in our nation’s infrastructure in nearly a century. Now, with the passage of President Biden’s historic Build Back Better Act, House Democrats are delivering on our promise to build an economy that puts working families first!”
“For far too long, those at the very top have seen their fortunes grow while hard-working Americans have been squeezed,” continued Sewell. “Not anymore—I’m proud to report that the Build Back Better Act will uplift Alabama’s most underserved communities with transformational progress! The bill will provide affordable health insurance to Alabamians caught in the coverage gap, lower prescription drug costs, create universal pre-K, extend the Child Tax Credit, address the climate crisis and environmental injustice with bold action, and so much more. Together, President Biden and Congressional Democrats will continue to deliver historic progress for the American people!”
The Build Back Better Act:
Creates Millions of Good-Paying Jobs - Together with the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Build Back Better Act will create an average of 2 million jobs per year over the course of the next decade.
Cuts Taxes for Families and Workers - Prior to the pandemic, 16% of children under the age of 18 in Alabama lived in poverty. The Build Back Better Act will bolster financial security and spur economic growth in Alabama by reducing taxes on the middle class and those striving to break into it. The bill will extend Child Tax Credit (CTC) increases of $300/month per child under 6 or $250/month per child ages 6 to 17. This will continue the largest one-year reduction in child poverty in history. Critically, the agreement includes permanent refundability for the Child Tax Credit, meaning that the neediest families will continue to receive the full Child Tax Credit over the long-run. The bill will also provide a tax cut of up to $1,500 for 274,300 low-wage workers in Alabama by extending the American Rescue Plan’s Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) expansion.
Closes the Medicaid Coverage Gap and Provides the Largest Expansion of Affordable Health Care in a Decade - Because states like Alabama refuse to expand Medicaid, about 4 million Americans and nearly 300,000 Alabamians lack health insurance. The Build Back Better Act will close the Medicaid coverage gap by extending through 2025 the enhanced premium subsidies in the ACA Marketplace that were included in the American Rescue Plan. In doing so, it will ensure that every Alabamian and every American in the Medicaid coverage gap has access to affordable health insurance.
Expands Medicare with Hearing Coverage for Seniors - Beginning January 1, 2023, the bill allows for qualified audiologists to deliver aural rehabilitation and treatment services under Medicare, in addition to the hearing and balance assessment services provided under current law. It also allows for qualified hearing aid professionals to deliver hearing assessment services under Medicare. The bill also provides for coverage of hearing aids under Medicare Part B forindividuals with moderately severe, severe or profound loss in one or both ears.
Lowers Prescription Drug Costs - The Build Back Better Act allows the Secretary of HHS to negotiate certain drug prices and halts price hikes above inflation for all Americans. It ensures that Americans with diabetes don’t pay more than $35 per month for their insulin. It also creates a new, out-of-pocket cap of $2,000 on what seniors pay for their drugs in Medicare Part D.
Lowers Child Care Costs - Working families across Alabama are facing a child care crisis. The high cost of child care is straining family budgets and pushing millions of Alabamians out of the workforce – a majority of whom are women. The lack of affordable child care is also hurting our economy. As workers are forced to stay home, employers are struggling to fill job openings to meet demand and grow their businesses. The Build Back Better Act will dramatically lower the cost of child care for many families. Under the bill, the vast majority of families would not pay more than seven percent of their income on child care, representing an enormous savings from what they pay now. The bill invests a total $390 billion for the child care initiative and the universal preschool initiative. Under the bill, child care providers would also have resources to raise wages for child care workers and expand available supply to serve more children and families.
Establishes Paid Family and Medical Leave - The United States lags behind the rest of the industrialized world when it comes to guaranteeing paid family and medical leave. Only 21 percent of American workers have access to employer-provided paid family leave, and just 42 percent of American workers have access to paid medical leave through an employer-provided plan. The Build Back Better Act establishes a universal and permanent family and medical leave program. The program provides four weeks of paid parental, family caregiving, and medical leave.
Provides Universal, High-Quality, Free Pre-K for Every 3- and 4-year old in America - Today, only 23% of 3- and 4-year-olds in Alabama have access to publicly funded preschool, and it costs about $8,600 per year for those who can’t access a publicly-funded program. The Build Back Better Act will enable Alabama to expand access to free, high-quality preschool to more than about 105,000 additional 3- and 4-year-olds per year and increase the quality of preschool for children who are already enrolled. Parents will be able to send their children to the preschool setting of their choice—from public schools to child care providers to Head Start—leading to lifelong educational benefits, allowing more parents to go back to work, and building a stronger foundation for Alabama’s future economic competitiveness.
Invests in HBCUs, TCUs and MSIs - The Build Back Better Act invests $3 billion in a competitive grant program to improve the research capacity and research and development infrastructure at four-year Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). The competitive grant program will consist of planning grants for a period of one to two years and implementation grants for a period of one to five years. The bill also invests $6 billion in institutional aid grants to HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, which can be used by these institutions to strengthen their academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities and award need-based financial aid to low-income students.
Reduces Housing Costs and Expands Housing Options - 260,000 renters in Alabama are rent burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent, while homeownership remains out of reach for many families. The Build Back Better Act will expand rental assistance for Alabama renters, while also increasing the supply of high-quality housing through the construction and rehabilitation of over 1 million affordable housing units nationwide. It will address the capital needs of the entire public housing stock in America and it includes one of the largest investments in down payment assistance in history, enabling more first-generation homebuyers to purchase their first home.
Makes the Largest Effort to Combat Climate Change in American History - From 2010 to 2020, Alabama experienced 38 extreme weather events, costing up to $20 billion in damages. The Build Back Better Act is the largest effort to combat climate change in American history, investing $555 billion over 10 years in clean energy and climate investments. It contains green tax credits which will save the average American family hundreds of dollars per year in energy costs. It also Ensures clean energy technology – from wind turbine blades to solar panels to electric cars – will be built in the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of good jobs here at home.

48,Economy,Rep. Sewell Announces Over $17 Million in RAISE Funding for the City of Tuscaloosa,"November 18, 2021","Tuscaloosa, AL – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced $17,149,167 in funding for the City of Tuscaloosa from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) grant program. This funding will be used to support the city’s Tuscaloosa University Boulevard Corridor project, allowing the City of Tuscaloosa in conjunction with the University of Alabama and the Alabama Department of Transportation to make necessary transportation infrastructure improvements.
“This is great news for the City of Tuscaloosa and its partners! Investing in our infrastructure provides cities with the revenue they need to not only rebuild but modernize and make room for new innovative development,” said Rep. Sewell. “I applaud the City of Tuscaloosa, the University of Alabama, and the Alabama Department of Transportation for working together to rebuild and revitalize this community. These are the types of funding opportunities that will ensure that the 7th Congressional District can build back better!”
Background:
The City of Tuscaloosa received a federal grant of $17,149,167 from the U.S. Department of Transportation to support the city and its partners, the University of Alabama and the Alabama Department of Transportation, to make transportation infrastructure improvements.
            Specifically, the RAISE funding will support the following: 

Technology upgrades
Stormwater drainage improvements to address resilience and environmental issues
Expand pedestrian access from residential areas to institutional and retail areas

“The City of Tuscaloosa could not be more thrilled to be among the recipients of the Department of Transportation’s RAISE Grant. These funds will give us the opportunity to make improvements to one of the major arteries connecting all of Tuscaloosa and will provide better connectivity across our community,” said Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox. “The enhancements that will be made to the University Blvd corridor will include increased storm drain capacity, streetscape enhancements, advancements in security and safety measures, and the inclusion of bike lanes and underground utilities in several locations.”
The Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity, or RAISE Discretionary Grant program, provides a unique opportunity for the DOT to invest in road, rail, transit and port projects that promise to achieve national objectives. Previously known as the Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) and Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Discretionary Grants, Congress has dedicated nearly $8.9 billion for twelve rounds of National Infrastructure Investments to fund projects that have a significant local or regional impact.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
49,Economy,Rep. Sewell to Attend Signing of Infrastructure Bill at the White House,"November 15, 2021","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) will join President Biden for the signing of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act at the White House. The bill—which passed the House of Representatives on Friday, November 5th—is the largest investment in U.S. infrastructure in nearly a century. As the only member of the Alabama Congressional delegation to vote in favor of the bill, Rep. Sewell played a lead role in securing the inclusion of critical provisions that will benefit Alabama’s 7th District.
“Thanks to our hard work, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act contains transformational provisions that will directly benefit the people of Alabama’s 7th District,” said Rep. Sewell. “In addition to creating jobs and rebuilding our roads and bridges, the bill will help alleviate blocked railroad crossings and invest hundreds of millions of dollars in improving Alabama’s water infrastructure. Today, I will proudly stand with President Biden as he signs this bill and delivers these historic wins for the people!”
President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act contains several provisions that will address blocked railroad crossings:

The Railroad Crossing Elimination Program - This section would authorize $500 million a year for the new Railroad Crossing Elimination grant program. This includes a small set-aside to carry out a highway-rail grade crossing safety information and education program.
Blocked Crossing Portal - This section would require the Federal Railroad Administration to establish a blocked crossing portal to collect information about blocked highway-rail grade crossings from the public. The Federal Railroad Administration is to use the information to assess the impact of blocked crossings, inform outreach to communities and railroads about blocked crossings, and produce an annual report on the program. This pilot program will expire three years after enactment.
National Academies Study On Trains Longer Than 7,500 Feet -This section requires the Secretary to spend between $1 million and $2 million on a report by the National Academies on the operations, safety, and efficiency of trains longer than 7,500 feet, to be submitted to relevant Congressional committees within two years.
Railroad point of contact for public safety issues - This section would require all railroads to provide contact information on a public website so that the public could report public safety issues to the railroad.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will make transformational investments in Alabama’s water infrastructure. 
Currently, up to 10 million American households and 400,000 schools and child care centers lack safe drinking water. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, based on the traditional state revolving fund formula, Alabama will expect to receive $782 million over five years to improve water infrastructure across the state and ensure that clean, safe drinking water is a right in all communities. The bill also includes $23 billion nationally for the bipartisan Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will also:
Create Millions of Good-Paying Jobs - Together with the Build Back Better Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will create an average of 2 million jobs per year over the course of the next decade.
Repair and Rebuild Alabama’s Roads and Bridges - The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Alabama would expect to receive:

$5.2 billion for federal-aid highway apportioned programs
$225 million for bridge replacement and repairs under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act over five years. 

Alabama can also compete for the $12.5 billion Bridge Investment Program for economically significant bridges and nearly $16 billion of national funding in the bill dedicated for major projects that will deliver substantial economic benefits to communities.
Connect Every Alabamian to High-speed Internet - Broadband internet is necessary for Albamians to do their jobs, participate equally in school learning, health care, and to stay connected. Yet 18% of Alabama households do not have an internet subscription, and 11.5% of Alabama residents live in areas where, under the FCC’s benchmark, there is no broadband infrastructure. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Alabama will receive a minimum allocation of $100 million to help provide broadband coverage across the state, including providing access to the at least 565,000 Alabamians who currently lack it. It also makes 1,518,000 Alabamians (31%) eligible for the Affordability Connectivity Benefit, which will help low-income families afford internet access.
Improve Healthy, Sustainable Transportation Options - Alabamians who take public transportation spend an extra 66.2% of their time commuting and non-White households are 4.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation. 25% of transit vehicles in the state are past useful life. Based on formula funding alone, Alabama would expect to receive more than $400 million over five years under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to improve public transportation options across the state.
Invest in the Future of Electric Vehicle (EV) Travel in Alabama - The bill will build a network of EV chargers to facilitate long-distance travel and provide convenient charging options. The U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) sales is only one-third the size of the Chinese EV market. The bill invests $7.5 billion to build out the first-ever national network of EV chargers in the United States and is a critical element in the Biden-Harris Administration’s plan to accelerate the adoption of EVs to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Alabama would expect to receive $79 million over five years to support the expansion of an EV charging network in the state. Alabama will also have the opportunity to apply for the $2.5 billion in grant funding dedicated to EV charging in the bill.
Improve Alabama’s Airports - The United States built modern aviation, but our airports lag far behind our competitors. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, airports in Alabama would receive approximately $140 million for infrastructure development for airports over five years.
Protect Alabama’s Infrastructure from Climate Change and Cyber Attacks - The bill will prepare more of Alabama’s infrastructure for the impacts of climate change, cyber-attacks, and extreme weather events. From 2010 to 2020, Alabama has experienced 38 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $20 billion in damages. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, based on historical formula funding levels, Alabama will expect to receive:

$23 million over five years to protect against wildfires; and 
$19 million to protect against cyberattacks. 

Alabamans will also benefit from the bill’s historic $3.5 billion national investment in weatherization which will reduce energy costs for families.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
50,Economy,Rep. Sewell Votes for Largest Investment in U.S. Infrastructure in Nearly a Century,"November 5, 2021","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass President Biden’s historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the largest investment in U.S. infrastructure in nearly a century. This legislation will create millions of good-paying jobs, repair Alabama’s crumbling roads and bridges, expand access to high-speed affordable internet, and make transformational investments in Alabama’s drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. The bill's many provisions will supercharge America’s global competitiveness and put our nation back on track to have world class infrastructure. The bill passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 228-206 and will now make its way to President Biden’s desk to be signed into law.
“Today we’ve made history!” said Rep. Sewell. “Thanks to President Biden and Congressional Democrats, the United States Congress has passed the largest investment in our nation’s infrastructure in nearly a century. With today’s vote, President Biden has accomplished what previous administrations have been trying to do for decades.”
“Alabama’s infrastructure has been falling behind for far too long,” continued Sewell. “The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act contains transformational provisions that will revitalize the 7th District by creating good paying jobs, fixing our crumbling roads and bridges, expanding access to broadband, and finally addressing our broken water infrastructure. I fought to ensure that equity is a central focus of this bill, and I’m proud that it will uplift hard-working Alabamians from our biggest cities to our most rural communities.”
“I want to thank Representative Sewell for her hard work passing the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “For too long we’ve neglected investments in critical areas that directly impact American workers, American businesses and American families. One of the many historic investments in this bill is the effort to bridge the digital divide and ensure all Americans have access to reliable, affordable broadband. Broadband is not a luxury, it’s a necessity. Thanks to President Biden’s vision and the Congresswoman’s tireless effort to get this passed, we can now bring affordable broadband to every community in Alabama.”
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will:
Create Millions of Good-Paying Jobs - Together with the Build Back Better Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will create an average of 2 million jobs per year over the course of the next decade.

The bill also includes $23 billion nationally for the bipartisan Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act.
Address Railroad Crossing Blockages - The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act contains several provisions that would address the continued impact of blocked railroad crossings in Alabama and across the nation.

The Railroad Crossing Elimination Program - This section would authorize $500 million a year for the new Railroad Crossing Elimination grant program. This includes a small set-aside to carry out a highway-rail grade crossing safety information and education program.
Blocked Crossing Portal - This section would require the Federal Railroad Administration to establish a blocked crossing portal to collect information about blocked highway-rail grade crossings from the public. The Federal Railroad Administration is to use the information to assess the impact of blocked crossings, inform outreach to communities and railroads about blocked crossings, and produce an annual report on the program. This pilot program will expire three years after enactment.


National Academies Study on Trains Longer Than 7,500 Feet - This section requires the Secretary to spend between $1 million and $2 million on a report by the National Academies on the operations, safety, and efficiency of trains longer than 7,500 feet, to be submitted to relevant Congressional committees within two years.


Railroad point of contact for public safety issues - This section would require all railroads to provide contact information on a public website so that the public could report public safety issues to the railroad.

Improve Healthy, Sustainable Transportation Options - Alabamians who take public transportation spend an extra 66.2% of their time commuting and non-White households are 4.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation. 25% of transit vehicles in the state are past useful life.

52,Economy,Rep. Sewell Announces $1 Million Grant for Alabama From Economic Development Administration’s American Rescue Plan Programs,"October 21, 2021","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that the State of Alabama has received a grant of $1 million from the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA). These funds, authorized by the American Rescue Plan, will be used for statewide planning efforts to boost economic development, enhance U.S. competitiveness, combat the climate crisis, and recover from the pandemic. These are the first EDA American Rescue Plan grants announced.
“As the only member of the Alabama delegation to vote in favor of the American Rescue Plan, I’m proud that this transformational law continues to deliver critical assistance to the State of Alabama,” said Rep. Sewell. “Today’s $1 million grant will lay the foundation for President Biden’s historic Build Back Better agenda and help Alabamians continue to recover from this pandemic.”
All 59 states and territories were invited to apply for a $1 million grant through EDA’s Statewide Planning program—one of six programs EDA developed to equitably distribute its $3 billion in American Rescue Plan funding. 24 grants will be awarded today, with the remainder being disbursed in the coming weeks and months.
“The Biden Administration is giving states and territories the unprecedented opportunity to bring all their communities together to develop comprehensive plans to build back better and stronger,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo. “The $1 million Statewide Planning grants will be used to lay the groundwork for President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda to build resilient economies and increase U.S. Competitiveness.”
“Planning is the backbone of economic development and Building Back Better,” said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development Alejandra Y. Castillo. “EDA is proud to partner with state and territory leaders as they begin to tackle a wide range of challenges—including climate change, broadband, childcare, electric vehicle adoption, and pandemic recovery—and develop a comprehensive plan for their entire state or territory that ensures communities work together toward a common economic development vision for the future.”

53,Economy,Rep. Sewell Announces Nearly 6% Social Security Cost-of-Living Increase for 2022,"October 13, 2021","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for approximately 70 million Americans will increase 5.9 percent in 2022 thanks to this year’s cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). 
“As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee’s Subcommittee on Social Security, I have fought for critically important earned benefits for Alabama’s seniors,” said Rep. Sewell. “A nearly 6% cost-of-living adjustment is great news for seniors who have struggled during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this COLA increase is not a substitute for congressional action. Social Security is one of our nation’s most trusted and successful programs and serves as a lifeline for countless Alabamians. I will continue to do everything in my power to protect and expand Social Security so that all workers can retire with dignity.”
In Alabama’s 7th District alone, there are 157,219 Social Security beneficiaries including 9,945 widowers and 16,459 children. For many, Social Security benefits are a lifeline and help cover the costs of basic necessities like food, rent, health care, and medications.
The COLA protects benefits against losing their purchasing power over time when the cost of rent, food, and other expenses increase. Medicare premiums – which are deducted from Social Security checks for most beneficiaries – typically consume much of the COLA increase. One study found that over the past 20 years, the increase in premiums has averaged 5.9 percent annually while COLAs have averaged 2.2 percent annually. Because “a larger and larger chunk of the Social Security benefit goes to health insurance, […] the net benefit available for non-health expenditures does not keep pace with inflation.” This demonstrates that while COLA increases are critical, they are not a substitute for robust congressional action.
The 5.9 percent cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) will begin with benefits payable to more than 64 million Social Security beneficiaries in January 2022. Increased payments to approximately 8 million SSI beneficiaries will begin on December 30, 2021. (Note: some people receive both Social Security and SSI benefits). The Social Security Act ties the annual COLA to the increase in the Consumer Price Index as determined by the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Social Security and SSI beneficiaries are normally notified by mail starting in early December about their new benefit amount. Most people who receive Social Security payments will be able to view their COLA notice online through their personal my Social Security account. People may create or access their my Social Security account online at www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount.
The Social Security Act provides for how the COLA is calculated. To read more, visit www.socialsecurity.gov/cola.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
54,Economy,"Rep. Sewell Votes to Address Debt Ceiling, Avert Catastrophic Default","October 12, 2021","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass critical legislation to prevent a first-ever default on the federal debt, which would result in economic catastrophe for nearly every American family. This crucial bill—which Senate Democrats passed on October 7th—will keep the United States under the debt limit through at least December 3rd.
“Defaulting on our credit would cause an unprecedented economic collapse, hurting every American and every Alabamian,” said Rep. Sewell. “Contrary to what some would have you believe, suspending the debt limit does not authorize any new spending. This is about paying bills that have piled up under previous administrations including President Trump's. Addressing the debt ceiling is the responsible thing to do, and I was proud to join my Democratic colleagues to protect families from catastrophe and pay our bills.”
With this legislation, which President Biden will soon sign into law, the federal government will be able to continue meeting financial obligations for another two months. This action only addresses previously approved spending, including bipartisan COVID relief, payments to Social Security recipients, payments of veterans’ benefits and paychecks for members of the military, and does not authorize future spending.
Senate Republicans continue to block action on a House-passed bill that addresses the debt ceiling through 2022—risking a cataclysmic default that would trigger a global economic collapse and devastate the financial security of nearly every American family.  A recent study by Moody’s showed that a debt default would:

Wipe out $15 trillion in household wealth;
Erase up to six million jobs; and
Double the unemployment rate, surging up to nine percent.

 Over the last decade, every time the debt limit has needed to be addressed, Congress has acted on a bipartisan basis—including three times under President Trump.  Despite Republicans adding $7.8 trillion to the federal debt over the last four years—including a $2 trillion tax cut benefiting the rich—Democrats still helped Republicans address the debt ceiling, because the full faith and credit of the United States must never come under threat.
Now, under President Biden, McConnell and many Republicans refuse to join Democrats to address the debt limit even though only 3 percent of the current debt was accumulated under President Biden, and more than 27 percent was incurred under President Trump. This is blatantly hypocritical: just two years ago, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed that“America can't default” because “that would be a disaster.”","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
55,Economy,"Rep. Sewell Votes to Extend Government Funding, Provide Emergency Relief, and Suspend Debt Limit","September 20, 2021","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass H.R. 5304. This legislation would extend government funding through December 3, suspend the debt limit to protect the full faith and credit of the United States, and provide emergency funding to address recent natural disasters and the resettlement of Afghan refugees. The bill passed in the House of Representatives today.
“This legislation is absolutely essential to the well-being of the United States,” said Rep. Sewell. “In addition to providing critically important emergency funds to address Hurricane Ida and the resettlement of Afghan refugees, it would also prevent a global financial collapse by ensuring the U.S. meets its financial obligations to the world. Supporting this bill is the responsible thing to do, and I was proud to cast my vote for it today.”
H.R. 5304 includes provisions that would:

Extend Funding for Critical Programs - The Continuing Resolution extends funding for vital federal agencies, including education, health, housing, and public safety programs through December 3.  The funding will grow opportunity through early child education, investments in our schools, and high-quality job training programs; provide a lifeline to the vulnerable through nutrition and affordable housing; and honor Congress’ solemn responsibility to secure our nation and support our veterans. 
Provide Emergency Disaster Funding - The emergency disaster funding provides $28.6 billion to address the rising cost of climate change, recent natural disasters including Hurricane Ida, wildfires, severe droughts and winter storms, and other natural and major disasters declared in 2021 and prior years. This funding will help working families, small businesses, and communities get back on their feet and rebuild, while repairing damage to federal facilities.
Provide Funding to Support Afghan Refugees - The $6.3 billion supplemental to support Afghan evacuees includes funding to temporarily house evacuees at American facilities and in foreign countries, provide necessary security screenings, and ultimately resettle evacuees in the United States. The legislation also includes funding to provide humanitarian assistance for Afghan refugees in neighboring countries.
Suspend the Debt Limit - H.R. 5304 also includes provisions suspending the debt limit through December 2022, in order to meet the obligations that the government has already made and to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.

Failure to raise or suspend the debt limit would be catastrophic.

Failure to suspend or raise the debt limit would cause the first default in U.S. history.
First, a default would jeopardize all U.S. government payments, including Social Security payments, veterans’ benefits, military pay, payments to defense contractors, etc.
Secondly, a default would hurt all American families by causing interest rates to go up.
Thirdly, a default could cause a nationwide recession, damaging the livelihoods and savings of millions of working families across the country.
Fourthly, a default could trigger a worldwide financial crisis. That’s because financial markets currently treat U.S. debt as the safest of assets, with all other assets around the world benchmarked against us. Our default would send waves of financial panic cascading through lots of other markets.

Addressing the debt limit is about meeting obligations the government has already made, including the COVID relief legislation from December, as well as vital payments to Social Security recipients and our veterans.

A new report shows that only 3 percent of total debt subject to the limit has accumulated under Biden, whereas 27.5 percent of this debt was incurred during the former president’s term.
Since 2011, every time the debt limit has needed to be suspended or raised, Congress has suspended or raised it on a bipartisan basis and without incident. Since 2011, Congress has taken this action on a bipartisan basis seven times.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
56,Economy,Rep. Sewell Votes to Advance Congressional Democrats’ and President Biden’s Build Back Better Act out of House Ways and Means Committee,"September 14, 2021","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass the Build Back Better Act out of the House Ways and Means Committee. This historic $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package will level the playing field for working families, expand opportunity, and rebuild our economy to be more equitable and inclusive. Passage follows nearly 40 hours of debate by members of the House Ways and Means Committee during which Rep. Sewell secured the inclusion of several of her own bills. 
“President Biden and Congressional Democrats’ transformational Build Back Better agenda is about leveling the playing field for working families and growing our economy from the bottom up and middle out,” said Rep. Sewell. “With this bill, we are cutting taxes for middle class Americans and small businesses, expanding access to child care and healthcare, lowering prescription drug costs, and addressing the growing threat of climate change and environmental injustice. Its historic investments will uplift Alabamians who have been left behind and put us on a path to a more prosperous and equitable future.”
The Ways and Means Committee’s portion of the Build Back Better Act includes measures to:

Extend the extremely impactful American Rescue Plan expansion of the Child Tax Credit, and make permanent the American Rescue Plan expansions of the Earned Income Tax Credit and the child and dependent care tax credit;
Provide immediate coverage for Americans in the Medicaid coverage gap;
Extend the American Rescue Plan’s expanded premium tax credits to help lower health insurance costs;
Expanding Medicare coverage to include dental, vision, and hearing benefits, quickly getting new vision and hearing services to beneficiaries in 2022 and 2023, respectively, to eliminate cost and coverage barriers to this care;
Lower prescription costs for Americans by allowing the HHS Secretary to negotiate for lower drug prices;
Mitigate wealth inequality and strengthen the progressive power of our tax system by increasing the individual tax rate for high-earners, increasing the top capital gains rate, and adding a modest surtax on the highest-income taxpayers;
Level the playing field by cutting taxes for our nation’s smallest businesses and bringing the corporate rate to 26.5 percent;
Promote global competitiveness while ensuring that multinational corporations pay their fair share by better harmonizing the U.S. corporate minimum tax rate with the rate agreed to by over 130 countries in international negotiations;
Invest in tax fairness by better equipping the IRS with updated technology and the human capital necessary for the complex audits of high-wealth individuals.
Support clean energy investment and deployment and the creation of good, well-paying jobs;
Reinstate Build America Bonds and advanced refunding bonds to provide financing to state and local governments and spur investment in the private sector; and
Expand proven tax credit programs that encourage economic and affordable housing investments in our communities that are most in need.

Expand workplace supports by:

Providing up to 12 weeks of universal paid family and medical leave for all U.S. workers;
Reauthorizing the Health Profession Opportunity Grant (HPOG) program to strengthen this effective health care job training program and making it available nationwide; and
Investing in child care access and equity by:

Ensuring that parents and caregivers have the most useful and up-to-date information on available child care options and helping them easily apply for slots;
Funding the construction and remodeling of child care facilities to make them even safer and more aligned with public health guidelines; and
Raising the wages of child care workers, who currently earn a median wage of $12.24 per hour and often live in poverty.



Strengthen retirement security by:

Requiring employers without employer-sponsored retirement plans to automatically enroll their employees in IRAs or 401(k)-type plans; and
Making the Saver’s Credit refundable so that those without any income tax liability are eligible to receive the benefit in the form of a contribution to their retirement account.

Protect the elderly and people with disabilities in nursing homes by:

Funding elder justice programs that increase support for state and local Adult Protective Services offices and long-term care ombudsman programs to better prevent elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation;
Addressing the staffing shortages in long-term care facilities by providing funds for recruitment and retention, including wage subsidies, access to child care, tuition reimbursement, and student loan replacement; and
Improving the accuracy and reliability of the data collected in these facilities to increase transparency for patients and their families, and strengthen the federal understanding of care quality and reimbursement, and study and update staffing – a key predictor of quality and safety.

Modernize and reform the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs by:

Increasing benefits and expanding eligibility to meet the needs of today’s workers under TAA for Workers program;
Reestablishing the TAA for Communities program to target support and initiate proactive outreach in trade-affected communities;
Delivering additional funding to the TAA for Community Colleges and Career Training program to better support students served by community colleges;
Expanding eligibility, improving outreach, and increasing funding for TAA for Firms to assist firms facing competition from abroad; and
Improving outreach and increasing benefits for TAA for Farmers, which hasn’t received new funding in a decade.

Rep. Sewell secured the inclusion of several of her own bills in the Build Back Better Act including:

Rural Health Training Opportunities Act - Expands the health profession opportunity grant program that provides education and training to low-income individuals for high-demand occupations in the healthcare field. 
Local Infrastructure Financing Tool (LIFT) Act - Provides a number of flexible financing tools that meet the unique needs of communities across the country, including transportation, public health facilities, schools, and other infrastructure and economic development projects. It will restore the ability of states and localities to refinance existing debt through advance refunding, a tool that Republicans gutted in their 2017 tax bill.
New Markets Tax Credit Extension Act – This bill will once and for all make the successful New Markets Tax program permanent. The proposal provides:

An additional $2 billion (for a total of $7 billion) in 2022
$1 billion (for a total of $6 billion) in 2023.



From then forward, it sets the allocation amounts at $5 billion for 2024 and all years thereafter.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means

Fudge to Birmingham, Alabama. The visit was intended to promote the Biden-Harris Administration’s Build Back Better agenda which includes historic investments in housing construction and rehabilitation, economic development, and community revitalization.
The visit began with a tour of the Villas at Titusville, a newly redeveloped affordable housing community in Birmingham, where Sec. Fudge and Rep. Sewell highlighted President Biden’s plan to build or preserve more than 2 million affordable and sustainable homes nationwide. Such a plan would drive down the costs of housing by dramatically expanding the country’s supply of affordable housing.
Next, Rep. Sewell joined Sec. Fudge for a tour of the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute to share a glimpse of Birmingham’s rich civil rights history. This was followed by a roundtable on affordable housing and community revitalization with state and local officials.
The visit concluded with a tour of Southtown Court public housing community.
Rep. Sewell’s remarks from this morning’s press conference are included below:
Good morning Birmingham! What a glorious day to welcome the Secretary of Housing and Development, my dear friend and former colleague Marcia Fudge, the 18th Secretary of HUD, to our wonderful city!
I am proud to host my friend and colleague in today’s tour and visit throughout Birmingham so that she can see how far we’ve come. As Secretary, she just toured the villas right here in Titusville and we are very proud of this new development. 
But as Mayor Woodfin said and we all know, there’s still much work to be done right here in Birmingham and we could use more federal resources to do that work!
As the only member of Alabama’s Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of the American Rescue Plan, here’s what I know for a fact. I know that the people I represent need as much assistance as possible to thrive on the other end of this pandemic.
I’ve heard them. Mayor Woodfin has heard them, and the Biden Administration has heard them and that is why I am happy to stand here with Secretary Fudge and say that MORE HELP IS ON THE WAY! 
That means more money. 
As we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden, his cabinet, and Congressional Democrats have laid out a bold vision for our nation -- one that will help us not just return to the way things were, but instead to Build Back Better, stronger, and more EQUITABLY than before.
As President Biden said himself, the best way to grow our economy is from the bottom up and the middle out, and that’s EXACTLY what we’re doing with the American Rescue Plan resources. 
The City of Birmingham Alabama received 140 million dollars from the American Rescue Plan and I know that the Mayor and the City Council are hard at work making sure that those resources are there for the citizens of Birmingham to build back better. 
It will make our lives much better and more affordable housing is one of the tenants of the American Rescue Plan. 
So what does this mean for Alabama’s 7th Congressional District? 
Here in the 7th district, we’re tough. I’ve often said that what we lack in economic resources, we more than make up in a resilient spirit and hard work ethic and in making sure that we work together for our community.  We know that we’ve had systemic DIS-INVESTMENT that has prevented too many of our people from reaching their full potential.
We know that issues like pollution and lack of affordable, quality housing have really set us back. But we also know what’s possible. We see it right at this site. We will see it later at Southtown and the redevelopment that will go on with that as well. 
But we have a historic opportunity with the American Rescue Plan and this Administration to Build Back Better than before and we must seize this opportunity. 
I’m so proud to join with Secretary Fudge, President Biden, and Congressional Democrats as we finally address these long-standing disparities that exist. The pandemic has only laid bare those disparities. Those disparities exist not only in housing, in healthcare, but in environmental injustice. 
And we know that with more resources we can not only build back better housing but build back more efficient and green housing and in doing so save our planet and be more efficient and provide very good, high-paying jobs for our community. 
The Build Back Better agenda would build or preserve more than 2 million affordable and sustainable homes and would drive down the costs of housing by dramatically expanding our supply of affordable housing.
I also want to say that we’re not just doing the talk, we're doing the walk. 
If you all turned on your televisions this morning you realize that Senate Democrats did pass a 3.5 trillion dollar blueprint that will usher in not only the American Rescue Plan but Biden’s American Jobs Plan and yes, American Family Plan as well. So we look forward to rolling up our sleeves and not just talking the talk but doing the walk. 
I’m also excited about the infrastructure package that passed through the Senate last night. It will include historic investments in Alabama. 
It includes $5.2 billion in fixing Alabama’s highways. $225 million to repair and replace our failing bridges. And it would invest at least $100 million dollars for broadband. 
If there’s anything that we’ve realized during this pandemic, it’s that the systemic disinvestment in infrastructure has been a huge disadvantage for communities of color and for low income families. No more. Help is on the way. Help is here. And more help is also on the way. 
I’m excited also that in the infrastructure package we were able to put the largest investment in clean drinking water and wastewater resources in America’s history. 
So I’m excited to roll those out and look forward to coming back and telling my constituents not only did we do it but we did it well and that Alabama, Birmingham, will not only thrive through this pandemic but also come back and build back better. 
Now I get the honor of introducing my friend and former colleague. 
As was said, Marcia Fudge brings a unique perspective to being the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. She was the first female and first African American Mayor of Warrensville Heights, Ohio!
She understands very much not only the importance of local government and the needs of local government, but she understands and fights for and did fight for over a decade as the Congresswoman for the 11th District of Ohio. 
It was an honor to serve with Marcia when she was the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. Throughout her career, Secretary Fudge has been a fierce advocate for low-income families, seniors, and communities across the country. During this challenging time in our nation’s history, there is no one better suited to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development than Secretary Fudge. 
As we have seen today in the Titusville community, the work of this agency makes a tremendous difference in the lives of so many of our families. 
But Secretary Fudge is not new to this work. Her foray into electoral politics began in 1999 when she was elected the first female and first African American Mayor of Warrensville Heights, Ohio. Among her many accomplishments as Mayor, Secretary Fudge adopted one of the first vacant and abandoned property ordinances in the state and helped to combat predatory lending. She also helped to address the city’s growing foreclosure crisis and prioritized improving the City’s tax base and expanded opportunities for affordable housing.
I am very excited, with no further ado, to introduce the 18th Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, none other than the distinguished Marcia Fudge!
Background
Today’s events follow two significant milestones in the rollout of President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda and the fight to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate passed President Biden’s $1 trillion infrastructure bill, a bipartisan agreement to make the largest long-term investment in our country’s infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century. This investment will grow the economy, create good jobs, enhance our competitiveness, and make our economy more sustainable, resilient, and equitable. 
Among its many provisions:

Alabama would expect to receive $5.2 billion for federal-aid highway apportioned programs and $225 million for bridge replacement and repairs over five years.
Alabama would receive a minimum allocation of $100 million to help provide broadband coverage across the state.
The bill makes the largest investment in clean drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in American history, replacing all of the nation’s lead pipes and delivering clean water to millions of families.

This morning, the Senate also passed a budget resolution paving the way for congressional Democrats’ $3.5 trillion reconciliation package which is expected to include additional programs to drive down costs for hard-working families, expand access to health care, and invest in affordable housing and climate resiliency.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
59,Economy,Rep. Sewell Votes to Pass Fiscal Year 2022 Government Funding Bills,"July 30, 2021","Washington, D.C. – This week, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass nine of House Democrats’ Fiscal Year 2022 spending bills to fund the federal government through 2022 and make historic investments in working families, infrastructure, health care, education, and our veterans. The bills also include funding for key issues important to Alabama’s 7th District.
“These government funding bills will benefit and uplift hard-working Alabamians by funding education, health care, worker protections, and environmental justice,” said Rep. Sewell. “They also make robust investments in Alabama’s 7th District by funding broadband infrastructure, wastewater infrastructure, civil rights historic preservation, and our HBCUs. I’m thrilled to see these funding packages pass the House and look forward to their consideration in the Senate.”
In addition to ensuring the federal government is properly funded through Fiscal Year 2022, the bills create tens of thousands of good-paying American jobs, rebuild our nation’s crumbling infrastructure, expand access to safe and affordable housing, bolster the nation’s public health infrastructure, and make critical investments in clean energy and science initiatives to combat the climate crisis.
The Appropriations bills will have a direct impact on Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. Among many other provisions, the package:

60,Economy,Rep. Sewell Secures Over $7.8 Million for Community Projects in Alabama’s 7th District in House’s FY2022 Government Funding Bills,"July 30, 2021","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that she secured the inclusion of over $7.8 million for eight community projects in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District in House Democrats’ FY2022 government funding bills. With the passage of these bills in the House of Representatives this week, funding for these community projects has cleared a key hurdle. The bills must now face negotiations in the Senate.
“I fought hard to secure funding for community projects in Alabama’s 7th District in the 2022 government funding bills, and I am beyond thrilled to announce that over $7.8 million was included for projects in our district,” said Rep. Sewell. “By including funding for these projects, House Democrats are bypassing bureaucracy and getting money directly into the community where it’s needed. I am hopeful that the Senate will swiftly approve this funding and I look forward to seeing President Biden sign it into law.”
In April, Rep. Sewell submitted requests to the House Appropriations Committee to fund community projects in Alabama’s 7th District. Funding for eight of these projects, totaling $7,829,355, was included in House Democrats’ appropriations package that passed in the House this week. The bills will now make their way to the Senate where they will face additional negotiations before being passed and signed into law by President Biden. Rep. Sewell looks forward to her other community project funding requests being included in Appropriations bills still pending before the House of Representatives.
Rep. Sewell secured funding, totaling $7,829,355.00, for the following community projects in the House’s government funding bills:
*NOTE: Funding for these projects must still be passed by the Senate.

Jefferson County - Greater Shiloh Baptist Church - Employment and Training Project

Recipient: Cornerstone Revitalization Foundation, Inc.
Award: $1,500,000.00
Project: To reduce recidivism, CWD will afford adults ages 25 and older opportunities to learn trade and technical skills. Participants will also have the opportunity to get their GED and pursue post-secondary education opportunities and help with obtaining affordable housing. The program is about assisting participants with not just jobs but careers. 


Jefferson County - North Birmingham Community Development Rehabilitation Project

Recipient: City of Birmingham
Award: $3,000,000.00
Project: The North Birmingham Community has suffered from environmental justice concerns for over a century. A largely redlined area, the community includes multiple coal refinement operations, the 35th Avenue Superfund site, and parts of the community sustain flood damage regularly. This project would remove environmental concerns in the old North Birmingham Elementary School. The redevelopment of the North Birmingham site would provide a transformative redevelopment investment in North Birmingham.


Jefferson County - Small Business Accelerator Program

Recipient: Central Alabama Redevelopment Alliance
Award: $474,355.00
Project: The Small Business Accelerator provides micro companies and small businesses access to instructional workshops, key resource providers, and other support to help them expand and create jobs for the local community. The Accelerator helps Alabama small businesses establish core systems and processes that would allow their business to survive a natural disaster, economic downturn, or other business interruptions.


Lowndes County - Wastewater Disposal Treatment System Project

Recipient: Lowndes County Unincorporated Wastewater Program
Award: $700,000.00
Project: Failing septic tanks and deteriorating wastewater infrastructure in Lowndes County have left many families with untreated sewage in their yards and in local waterways. This is not only an infrastructure crisis, but a healthcare crisis. This funding would facilitate the installation of septic tanks for homes in unincorporated areas without proper wastewater disposal systems. 


Perry County – Drinking Water Infrastructure Project

Recipient: City of Marion
Award: $480,000.00
Project: The improvement of the City of Marion’s water infrastructure is critical to the health and economic vitality of the community. Failures of the water system after recent natural disasters have threatened the continued operation of local institutions like Marion Military Institute and Judson College. These funds will help provide functional water systems to a community that is combating intergenerational poverty in the Black Belt.


Sumter County - Hill Hospital Construction Project

Recipient: Hill Hospital
Award: $575,000.00
Project: For several years, Hill Hospital has faced persistent challenges to provide comprehensive health care to the citizens in Sumter County. Geographic isolation, economic fluctuations, and the COVID 19 pandemic have magnified these challenges. This funding will improve the facilities and patient rooms at Hill Hospital so they can continue to serve the county and provide healthcare to the rural community. The long-term viability of Hill Hospital will prevent residents from traveling to other counties and states to seek health care.


Tuscaloosa County - Community Health Worker Initiative

Recipient: West Central Alabama Area Health Education Center
Award: $300,000.00
Project: The Community Health Worker Initiative will develop and implement a training program throughout Alabama to improve access to healthcare, increase community resilience, and promote health education in rural areas. Nearly half of Alabama’s state population lives in a rural county, and on average, those individuals are more likely to be low-income, uninsured, and suffer from higher rates of chronic health conditions. This program will help aid these communities while also addressing the primary care, dental, and mental health workforce shortage in Alabama.


Tuscaloosa County - TRAMS CORE Improvement of Postsecondary Education

Recipient: Stillman College
Award: $800,000.00
Project: The Translational and Mechanistic Science for Collaborative Organic Research Environment (TRAMS CORE) program addresses traditional roadblocks for research and will provide a platform to generate new research efforts on the campus of a HBCU. Subsequently, the successful integration of shared resources will support continued growth in biomedical research in the community. This proposal is part of a long-term commitment toward the development and sustainability of biomedical research facilities at Stillman College.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
61,Economy,Rep. Sewell Votes to Strengthen Consumer Protections Amid Surge in Scams and Fraud during Pandemic,"July 20, 2021","Washington D.C.  – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to strengthen protections for consumers by passing H.R. 2668, the Consumer Protection and Recovery Act. This critical bill restores the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) authority to go to court to get victimized consumers and businesses their money back from scammers and other lawbreakers after the Supreme Court gutted the agency’s authority earlier this year. The bill passed in the House of Representatives amid a surge in scams and fraud during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Too often, scammers prey on society’s most vulnerable, particularly our seniors, veterans, small businesses, and the disabled,” said Rep. Sewell. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen a surge in this type of illegal activity.”
“This is simple,” continued Sewell. “When hard-working Alabamians fall victim to financial scams, the FTC should have the authority to step in and return them their money. That’s why I was proud to support the Consumer Protection and Recovery Act and thrilled to see it pass the House today. With this bill, we are sending a clear message: government must work for the people.”
For more than forty years, the FTC used section 13(b) of the FTC Act to return money taken by scammers, fraudsters, and other lawbreakers to consumers. In fact, in the last three years alone, the FTC returned $11.5 billion to nearly 10 million consumers across every state. Those benefiting most often include senior citizens, veterans, small businesses, and the most vulnerable members of society, all of whom tend to be the most frequent victims of scams and other fraudulent activities.
However, on April 22, 2021, that monetary relief for consumers stopped when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that section 13(b) of the FTC Act is limited to stopping or mandating certain conduct and does not allow the FTC to seek equitable monetary relief or require bad actors to return money earned through illegal activity – despite the fact that the FTC had been doing so for over forty years.
The Consumer Protection and Recovery Act restores the FTC’s authority to seek monetary relief as it had been successfully doing for over forty years by amending section 13(b) of the FTC Act to provide the FTC with express authority to obtain both injunctive and monetary equitable relief, including monetary redress for consumers in court for all violations of the laws FTC enforces. The bill also makes explicit that the FTC may pursue many kinds of equitable relief, including restitution for losses, contract reformation and rescission, monetary refunds, and the refund of property, as well as forcing bad actors to return their ill-gotten gains.
The Consumer Protection and Recovery Act receives widespread support from key groups including:

AFL-CIO
Americans for Financial Reform
Consumer Federation of America
Consumer Reports
Consumer Action
National Consumers League
National Association of Consumer Advocates
National Consumer Law Center
Privacy Rights Clearinghouse

62,Economy,Rep. Sewell Encourages Alabama Families to Look Out for Child Tax Credit Monthly Payments which Begin Today,"July 14, 2021","Washington D.C.  – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) is encouraging hardworking families to be on the lookout for monthly payments from the Child Tax Credit of up to $300 per month per child beginning July 15th through December. 43,700 hard-working households, covering 93.5% of all children in Alabama’s 7th District, could get up to $300 per month per child July-December and even more after filing their taxes next year.
“I know that many parents, grandparents, and guardians in Alabama have struggled to afford food, child care, health care, and other necessities long before this pandemic,” said Rep. Sewell. “That’s why I fought to include an expansion of the Child Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan which House and Senate Democrats passed and President Biden signed into law in March.”
“I cannot overstate how transformational the expanded Child Tax Credit will be,” continued Sewell. “Starting today, hard-working Alabama families will receive monthly payments to afford housing, food, health care, child care, and other expenses. With the Child Tax Credit, we’re investing in our greatest asset, our children, by cutting child poverty in half and putting our kids on a path to success.” 
In the State of Alabama, the Child Tax Credit is expected to:

Benefit 91% of children (or 1,004,200) 
Impact 316,400 households
Lift 82,700 children out of poverty
Lift 43,100 children out of deep poverty

In Alabama’s 7th District, the Child Tax Credit is expected to:

Benefit 93.5% of children (or 138,300) 
Impact 43,700 households with an average benefit of $3,200 per household
Lift 14,200 children out of poverty
Lift 7,200 children out of deep poverty

According to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, the expanded Child Tax Credit could cut child poverty in the United States by more than half.
Nearly all hardworking families should get their monthly payments automatically beginning July 15th with no further action required. Families who did not file a tax return for 2019 or 2020 and who did not use the IRS non-filers tool last year to sign up for the Economic Impact Payments, should go online and use the IRS Child Tax Credit Non-filer Sign-up Tool to sign up today.
 
Major Tax Relief for Nearly All Working Families:
How Much Is the Child Tax Credit Expansion from the American Rescue Plan?
The American Rescue Plan expanded the Child Tax Credit to up to $3,600 per child for children ages 0 to 5 and $3,000 per child for children ages 6 to 17. 
The American Rescue Plan also authorized advance monthly payments of the Child Tax Credit through December 2021.  Beginning in July and running through December, qualifying families can get up to: 

$300 per month per child for children ages 0 to 5.
$250 per month per child for children ages 6 to 17

Families will get their remaining expanded Child Tax Credit when they file their 2021 tax return. 
Who Qualifies?
Families with children will qualify for a full credit if their income is below $75,000 for single filers, $112,000 for people filing as head of household, or $150,000 for people who are married and filing jointly.
How Do I Get My Payment?
Nearly all hardworking families should get their monthly payments automatically beginning July 15th with no further action required. If you’ve filed tax returns for 2019 or 2020, or if you signed up to receive a stimulus check from the Internal Revenue Service, you will get this tax relief automatically. You do not need to sign up or take any action.
Families who did not file a tax return for 2019 or 2020 and who did not use the IRS Non-filers tool last year to sign up for the Economic Impact Payments, should go online and use the IRS Child Tax Credit Non-filer Sign-up Tool to sign up today.
Families who got their refunds from the IRS through direct deposit will get these payments in their bank account around the 15th of every month until the end of 2021. People who don’t use direct deposit will receive their payment by mail around the same time.
Families will be able to determine their eligibility, check the status of their payments and more at IRS.gov/childtaxcredit2021 later this month.  
Watch out for scams
According to IRS.gov: “The IRS urges everyone to be on the lookout for scams related to both Advance Child Tax Credit payments and Economic Impact Payments. The IRS emphasized that the only way to get either of these benefits is by either filing a tax return with the IRS or registering online through the Non-filer Sign-up tool, exclusively on IRS.gov. Any other option is a scam.
Watch out for scams using email, phone calls or texts related to the payments. Be careful and cautious: The IRS never sends unsolicited electronic communications asking anyone to open attachments or visit a non-governmental web site.”","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means

64,Economy,Rep. Sewell’s Decentralized Wastewater Grant Act and Amendment to Boost Wastewater Funding Included in the INVEST in America Act,"July 5, 2021","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that her bill, H.R. 3745, the Decentralized Wastewater Grant Act, was included in House Democrats’ INVEST in America Act which passed in the House of Representatives on Thursday. The bill would establish a grant program under the Clean Water Act, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to help low and moderate income households connect their homes to existing wastewater infrastructure or install or upgrade individually owned decentralized wastewater systems. 
“Access to clean water and adequate wastewater infrastructure are basic human rights,” said Rep. Sewell. “For too many rural communities in my district and across the country, failing wastewater infrastructure has created serious health, economic, and environmental hazards.”
“The Decentralized Wastewater Grant Act will make it more affordable for families to connect their homes to existing wastewater systems or install quality septic systems of their own,” continued Sewell. “I was proud to introduce this legislation and thrilled to see it pass out of the House. This is one more step toward finally ending our country’s wastewater crisis.”
Sewell introduced the Decentralized Wastewater Grant Act on June 8, 2021. The bill originally provided $50 million for each fiscal year 2022 through 2026, totaling $250 million. However, thanks to an amendment offered by Sewell which passed the House on Wednesday, authorized funding for the program was doubled in the House bill. The bill would now provide $100 million for each fiscal year 2022 through 2026, totaling $500 million.

65,Economy,Rep. Sewell Announces over $7 Million in Funding for Local Head Start Programs,"June 30, 2021","Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced over $7 million in federal funding for Head Start programs serving Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. This funding will allow Head Start programs to continue preparing Alabama children for success and will grow our economy by helping caregivers get back to work knowing their children are safe and cared for.
“Our children are our future and our greatest asset,” said Rep. Sewell. “Tragically, the COVID-19 pandemic deprived too many Alabama children of a safe, supportive learning environment, causing them to fall behind in their educational journeys.”
“The best way to put our country on a path to prosperity is by investing in the next generation of change-makers,” continued Sewell. “I’m so proud to announce that Head Start programs serving children in Alabama’s 7th District will receive over $7 million from the American Rescue Plan. This funding will help us bounce back from the devastation of the past year by getting parents back to work and providing our children the tools they need to grow and thrive.”
Funding, which totals $7,170,627 was awarded to the following Head Start programs serving Alabama’s 7th Congressional District.
Head Start programs serving only Alabama’s 7th District:

Pickens County Community Action Committee and Community Development Corporation, Inc. - $271,606
Sumter County Opportunity, Inc. -  $579,106
Lowndes Co. School District - $233,318
The Black Belt Community Foundation - $367,326

Jefferson County Committee for Economic Opportunity - $959,593
Montgomery Community Action Committee & CDC Inc. - $1,554,254

This comes in addition to the $732 million in funding that Rep. Sewell helped secure through the American Rescue Plan (previously announced) to keep Alabama’s child care providers on the job and keep costs down for working families.
The American Rescue Plan also includes a historic increase in support for child care through the tax code, helping millions of working families afford needed care. Rep. Sewell played a critical role in drafting the expansions of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan, which are projected to cut child poverty in the United States in half. More information on the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit can be found here.
How local Head Start programs are using funding from the American Rescue Plan
“The 2020 school year was very challenging,” said Cynthia Simpson, Executive Director of Pickens County Community Action. “We, like many other schools, elected to offer virtual learning to protect our staff and most importantly, our little people. We understand the burden this may have caused and the educational setback, so we are proud to offer the Pickens County Summer Learning Program for our students. The American Rescue Plans has provided the opportunity to offer summer learning to ensure our 4-year-olds are prepared for the transition to kindergarten. We were also able to purchase PPE and an additional bus to provide necessary space for support staff and students during transport to and from school.”
“The Blackbelt Community Foundation has been overwhelmed with requests for support from our communities,” said Felicia Lucky, President of the Blackbelt Community Foundation. “Funds made possible by the American Rescue Plan have allowed us to bridge the digital divide that was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We were able to purchase laptops to keep our children and staff safe as we all worked to decrease the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Most importantly, we have been able to extend necessary resources for the communities supported by the Blackbelt Community Foundation in Choctaw, Dallas, Marengo, and Wilcox counties. This ensures our children have the tools necessary to navigate educational requirements during these unprecedented times.” 
“The Lowndes County Head Start plans on using the funds from the American Rescue Plan to provide mental health support for children, families, and our staff as well as opportunities for professional development,” said Lashica Mason, Fiscal Manager for Lowndes County Head Start. “The funds will also help purchase cleaning supplies and new playground equipment.”
Background on Head Start Programs
Head Start programs promote the school readiness of infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children from low-income families. Services are provided in a variety of settings including centers, family child care, and a child’s own home. Programs also engage parents or other key family members in positive relationships, with a focus on family wellbeing. Head Start programs provide services through 1,600 agencies in local communities and serve more than one million children per year in every state and U.S. territory. Most are run by non-profit organizations, schools, and community action agencies.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
66,Economy,"Reps. Sewell, Carter Introduce Tax Legislation to Help Forest Landowners Recover After Natural Disasters","June 29, 2021","Washington, D.C. – This Congress, U.S. Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Buddy Carter (GA-01), introduced H.R. 4210, the Disaster Reforestation Act of 2021. This legislation would help family and private timber growers recover from the loss of timber destroyed by natural disasters and reforest their lands.
“Alabama’s beautiful forests keep our economy, our environment, and our people healthy,” said Rep. Sewell. “But when disaster strikes, our private forest owners are often left devastated and without the ability to quickly recover. By fixing our tax code, the Disaster Reforestation Act offers a helping hand to Alabama’s private forest owners as they work to reforest after natural disasters. I am so proud to introduce this legislation and urge my colleagues to support it.”
“Forestry is a vital part of rural economies all across our country,” said Rep. Carter, lead Republican co-sponsor. “Unfortunately the current tax code provides no recourse for working forests struck by natural disasters. I’m proud to work with Congresswoman Sewell and our partners from across the country to address this issue. The Disaster Reforestation Act will ensure timber farming is a viable way of life, protecting the many jobs and consumer products it supports and its positive impact to our environment.”
Alabama’s private forest owners own 21 million acres of private forestland which are critical to the state’s economic and environmental health. Currently, Alabama’s private forests support $28 billion in economic activity and 119,000 jobs, contribute $906 million in tax revenue, and provide safe drinking water for 1.4 million Alabamians. They also help combat climate change by sequestering carbon emissions and releasing oxygen. 
Unfortunately, Alabama’s private forest landowners—many of which are families and small timber companies that produce products like lumber—face immense financial burdens when needing to reforest their lands after a natural disaster, which is often compounded at tax time when private forest owners find their ability to claim a casualty loss for destroyed timber is limited, often to zero dollars. 
The Disaster Reforestation Act would reduce this financial burden by providing for the equitable tax treatment of casualty loss of their timber crop when disaster strikes. In doing so, it would foster stability and growth in one of Alabama’s key industries and promote environmental wellness through reforestation.
“The economic impact of the forestry sector in Alabama is critically reliant on forest landowners’ ability to supply timber to our mills; especially here in Rural Southwest Alabama,” said Sheldon Day, Mayor of Thomasville, Alabama. “Congresswoman Sewell has proven time and time again that she understands the needs of her forestry constituents. The City of Thomasville sincerely appreciates her leadership in championing the Disaster Reforestation Act.” 
“This legislation is key in helping family forest owners recover after natural disasters and keeping Alabama’s forests as forests,” said Gray Skipper, Alabama Landowner and VP of Scotch Plywood Company. “This will ensure the forest products consuming mills have trees in the future to maintain local economies. It will also ensure these forests, some of which are the most biologically diverse in the country, can continue sequestering carbon, supporting at-risk species, providing the clean water supply, and recreation for Gulf communities.”
“Alabama’s 23 million acres of healthy forests supply the raw material for the state’s $28 billion forest industry that creates jobs for 123,000 Alabama workers,” said Chris Isaacson, President & CEO of Alabama Forestry Association. “The investment required by forest landowners over the decades from planting to harvest is at constant risk from natural disasters. Under the current tax code, when disaster strikes landowners lose twice. They lose their timber and they lose the ability to deduct the value of the timber damaged.  We are grateful that Congresswoman Sewell recognizes this inequity and applaud her for taking a leadership role in helping landowners and their local communities recover.”
“America’s forest landowners have been waiting for this vital fix in the tax code and are appreciative of Representative Sewell and Carter’s efforts to introduce the Disaster Reforestation Act,” said Scott Jones, CEO of the Forest Landowners Association. “The legislation will not only help timber owners recover from natural disasters but will stimulate rural economies and support our nation’s domestic timber supply.”
The Disaster Reforestation Act receives widespread support from national forestry stakeholders including:

The Forest Landowners Association
The Southern Group of State Foresters
The American Forest Foundation
The National Association of State Foresters
The Society of American Foresters
F&W Forestry Services
The Association of Consulting Foresters,
The National Alliance of Forest Owners.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
67,Economy,"Reps. Sewell, LaHood Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Boost Post-Graduation Scholarships, Strengthen Workforce Recruitment in Rural America","June 22, 2021","Washington, D.C. – Today, Reps. Terri Sewell (AL-07) and Darin LaHood (IL-18) introduced bipartisan legislation to boost post-graduation scholarships and strengthen workforce recruitment in rural America. The Workforce Development Through Post-Graduation Scholarships Act of 2021 would amend the Internal Revenue Service Code to exclude certain post-graduation scholarship grants from being treated as gross income which will alleviate student loan debt, help businesses attract and recruit talent, and boost economic growth in local communities.
“By attracting talented workers to jobs in Alabama’s rural and underserved communities, post-graduate scholarship grants play a critical role in boosting local economic growth and fostering prosperity, all while alleviating the burden of student debt,” said Rep. Sewell. “I’m proud to be introducing this legislation, which will ensure that these awards are effective tools for businesses and workers in Alabama’s 7th District.”
“In our modern economy, it’s essential we recruit talent into our workforce in underserved and rural communities and provide workers with the resources they need,"" said Rep. LaHood, lead Republican co-sponsor. ""Our legislation will alleviate the growing student debt, foster economic growth, and help organizations attract better talent and reward professionals who commit to their local communities.""
A post-graduation scholarship is a type of charitable grant made by foundations to attract individuals with certain career skills to a given region. It functions much like a traditional scholarship but would pay off a portion of student loans held by an individual who has already completed a degree or technical program.
Much like a traditional scholarship, the issuing foundation would establish appropriate eligibility requirements and put in place a process to verify that those requirements continue to be met through the duration of the scholarship award agreement. For example, a foundation that is looking to attract nurses or doctors to a community facing a shortage of qualified health professionals could award a post-graduation scholarship to a recipient but require that an individual live and be employed within a range of ZIP codes for a set number of years. 
The Workforce Development Through Post-Graduation Scholarships Act of 2021 would amend the Internal Revenue Service Code to exclude certain post-graduation scholarship grants from being treated as gross income which would increase the effectiveness of these awards by reducing the burden of student debt and boosting economic growth.
The bill already enjoys broad support from across the philanthropic sector.
“The student debt crisis is damaging the financial futures of American students and families,"" said Kathleen Enright, President & CEO of the Council on Foundations. ""For rural communities where it can be more difficult to attract or retain people with the skills to fill needed jobs, post-graduation scholarships are a great incentive for recent graduates to come back home or move to places they may not have previously considered. The Workforce Development Through Post-Graduation Scholarships Act provides foundations with tools to help attract talent to meet the needs in their communities. This legislation is a result of years of collaboration between members of Congress and philanthropic leaders, and I urge Congress to send this bill to the President’s desk to sign into law immediately.”
Companion legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sens. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) and Gary Peters (D-MI).","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means

Terri Sewell (AL-07) continued her American Rescue Plan District Tour with a stop at Bessemer City Hall to highlight the direct relief that the City of Bessemer and Bessemer City Schools will receive from the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Thanks to this historic legislation, the City of Bessemer will receive over $13.97 million in funding and Bessemer City Schools will receive over $15.91 million.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the systemic disinvestment that our communities have faced for too long,” said Rep. Sewell. “All throughout Alabama, local officials have been pleading for assistance and calling for direct financial support to weather the pandemic and build back better and stronger.” 
“I want you to know that we heard your calls,” continued Sewell. “As the only member of the Alabama Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of the American Rescue Plan, I am so proud to announce that the City of Bessemer will receive $13.97 million and Bessemer City Schools will receive $15.91 million. This funding will help our community deal with the immediate impacts of the pandemic now and put us on a path to a more prosperous future.”
The American Rescue Plan, passed by Congress on March 10, 2021, and signed into law by President Joe Biden on March 11, provides an historic $350 billion in Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds to help eligible state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments meet their present needs and build the foundation for a strong recovery. Of this, the State of Alabama will receive approximately $2.12 billion and Alabama’s local governments will receive approximately $1.8 billion, $13,970,941 of which will go to the City of Bessemer.
According to guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on May 10, 2021, funds for state and local governments can be used to:

Support public health expenditures, by funding COVID-19 mitigation efforts, medical expenses, behavioral healthcare, and certain public health and safety staff;
Address negative economic impacts caused by the public health emergency, including economic harms to workers, households, small businesses, impacted industries, and the public sector;
Replace lost public sector revenue, using this funding to provide government services to the extent of the reduction in revenue experienced due to the pandemic;
Provide premium pay for essential workers, offering additional support to those who have borne and will bear the greatest health risks because of their service in critical infrastructure sectors; and,
Invest in water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure, making necessary investments to improve access to clean drinking water, support vital wastewater and stormwater infrastructure, and to expand access to broadband internet.

The American Rescue Plan also provides an historic $122 billion in funding for K-12 public schools in the United States through the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund to help schools safely reopen and stay open and address the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the nation’s students. Of this, approximately $2 billion will go to Alabama’s K-12 schools including $15,913,000 for Bessemer City Schools.
The American Rescue Plan will save lives and livelihoods: 

Put Vaccines in Arms: The plan has created a $20 billion national vaccination program that includes setting up community vaccination sites nationwide and addressing disparities facing communities of color.  It also takes complementary measures to combat the virus, including scaling up testing and tracing, addressing shortages of personal protective equipment and other critical supplies, investing in high-quality treatments and addressing health care disparities. 
Put Money in People’s Pockets: The plan finishes the job on the President’s promise to provide $2,000 in direct assistance to households across America with checks of $1,400 per person, following the $600 down payment enacted in December.  The plan will also provide direct housing assistance, nutrition assistance for 40 million Americans, expand access to safe and reliable childcare and affordable health care, extend unemployment insurance so that 18 million American workers can pay their bills and support 27 million children with an expanded Child Tax Credit and more than 17 million low-wage workers through an improved Earned Income Tax Credit.
Put Children Safely Back in School: The plan delivers $170 billion for education and $45 billion for child care providers.  This includes a $130 billion investment in K-12 school re-opening and making up for lost time in the classroom, with funds that can be used for such things as reducing class sizes, modifying spaces so that students and teachers can socially distance, improving ventilation, implementing more mitigation measures, providing personal protective equipment and providing summer school or other support for students that help make up lost learning time this year.  The plan also provides more than $40 billion for higher education.
Put People Back In Jobs: The plan will provide crucial support for the hardest-hit small businesses, especially those owned by entrepreneurs from racial and ethnic backgrounds that have experienced systemic discrimination, with EIDL grants, expanded PPP eligibility and more.  The plan also provides crucial resources to protect the jobs of first responders, frontline public health workers, teachers, transit workers and other essential workers that all Americans depend on.

Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced more than $163 million in emergency funding for colleges and universities in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District from the American Rescue Plan. The funding will help local institutions recover from the severe financial fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and continue serving students safely.

This is a common-sense bill that will make it easier for part-time employees to begin contributing to their retirement accounts sooner in their employment,” said Rep. Sewell. “We know that Alabama’s working families are facing a retirement crisis. Too often, the incentives to save for retirement are designed to benefit the wealthy and the upper-middle class.  This is a fundamental inequity in our tax code, and we must rebalance retirement incentives so that all working individuals can retire with dignity and financial security.”
“I am also pleased that my bill was included in H.R. 2954, the SECURE Act 2.0, which passed out of the Ways and Means Committee this week,” continued Sewell. “This larger package includes a number of provisions that will expand retirement coverage and increase participation in retirement savings by realigning savings incentives to benefit middle class and working class families. In my district, where the median household income is $38,000 a year, saving for retirement can seem overwhelming. That is why I am committed to breaking down traditional barriers to saving for retirement.”
Background on H.R. 2944
The Reducing the Maximum Service Requirement for Long-term Part-time Workers to Make Elective Deferrals to 401(k) Plans Act amends the long-term part-time years of service 401(k) participation requirement included in the 2019 SECURE Act. As women are more likely to work part-time than men, this provision is particularly important for women in the workforce. The SECURE Act provides that except in the case of collectively bargained plans, employers maintaining a 401(k) plan must have a dual eligibility requirement under which an employee must complete either a one year of service requirement (with the 1,000-hour rule) or three consecutive years of service where the employee completes at least 500 hours of service. H.R. 2944 reduces the three-year rule to two years, allowing for part-time employees to begin saving for retirement sooner.

71,Economy,Rep. Sewell Continues American Rescue Plan District Tour with Visit to Montgomery County Public Schools,"May 5, 2021","Montgomery, AL — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) continued her American Rescue Plan District Tour with a stop at Carver High School to highlight the direct relief that Montgomery County Public Schools will receive from the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Thanks to the historic legislation, Montgomery County Public Schools will receive $129.7 million to get children back in schools safely and make up for lost time in the classroom.
“Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, we already faced substantial barriers in our public education system,” said Rep. Sewell. “Public school enrollment in Alabama’s Black Belt has seen an exponential decline in the past two decades. The pandemic only worsened this situation, putting an unprecedented strain on schools across the country and especially here in Alabama.”
“That is why I was proud to cast my vote for the American Rescue Plan which will deliver over $2 billion in funding for public schools in Alabama and $129.7 million to Montgomery County Public Schools,” continued Sewell. “We know this money is desperately needed because schools have told us. This funding will help schools safely reopen and get us on a path to a more sustainable and prosperous future.”
Specifically, Sewell announced federal funding for the following:

Over $122 billion for K-12 schools nationally
Over $2 billion for K-12 schools in Alabama
$129.7 million for Montgomery County K-12 schools

These funds can be used for such things as:

Reducing class sizes, 
Modifying spaces so that students and teachers can socially distance, 
Improving ventilation,
Implementing more mitigation measures,
Providing personal protective equipment, and 
Providing summer school or other support for students that help make up lost learning time this year.

The American Rescue Plan will save lives and livelihoods: 

Put Vaccines in Arms: The plan has created a $20 billion national vaccination program that includes setting up community vaccination sites nationwide and addressing disparities facing communities of color.  It also takes complementary measures to combat the virus, including scaling up testing and tracing, addressing shortages of personal protective equipment and other critical supplies, investing in high-quality treatments and addressing health care disparities. 
Put Money in People’s Pockets: The plan finishes the job on the President’s promise to provide $2,000 in direct assistance to households across America with checks of $1,400 per person, following the $600 down payment enacted in December.  The plan will also provide direct housing assistance, nutrition assistance for 40 million Americans, expand access to safe and reliable child care and affordable health care, extend unemployment insurance so that 18 million American workers can pay their bills and support 27 million children with an expanded Child Tax Credit and more than 17 million low-wage workers through an improved Earned Income Tax Credit.
Put Children Safely Back in School: The plan delivers $170 billion for education and $45 billion for child care providers.  This includes a $130 billion investment in K-12 school re-opening and making up for lost time in the classroom, with funds that can be used for such things as reducing class sizes, modifying spaces so that students and teachers can socially distance, improving ventilation, implementing more mitigation measures, providing personal protective equipment and providing summer school or other support for students that help make up lost learning time this year.  The plan also provides more than $40 billion for higher education.
Put People Back In Jobs: The plan will provide crucial support for the hardest-hit small businesses, especially those owned by entrepreneurs from racial and ethnic backgrounds that have experienced systemic discrimination, with EIDL grants, expanded PPP eligibility and more.  The plan also provides crucial resources to protect the jobs of first responders, frontline public health workers, teachers, transit workers and other essential workers that all Americans depend on.

Background on the American Rescue Plan District Tour: 
Rep. Sewell’s American Rescue Plan District Tour is a series of site visits, roundtable discussions, and constituency meetings to connect residents of Alabama’s 7th Congressional District with all the resources available in the American Rescue Plan. The tour began on Tuesday, March 23, 2021.

72,Economy,Rep. Sewell Announces Over $732 Million in Funding from the American Rescue Plan to Keep Alabama Child Care Providers on the Job and Keep Costs Down for Working Families,"April 19, 2021","Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced over $732 million in additional federal funding to the State of Alabama through the American Rescue Plan. This funding will help child care providers open safely, keep workers on the payroll and lower child care costs for hardworking families. 
“The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a child care crisis. Across Alabama, providers have been forced to lay off and furlough workers just to stay afloat.” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “At the same time, hardworking families have been struggling to access basic child care services. That’s why I am thrilled to announce over $732 million in additional federal funding for child care through the American Rescue Plan. This funding will provide a critical lifeline to our child care providers and will help our economy bounce back by getting parents back to work.”
The total amount of $732,997,365 comes as part of two programs through the American Rescue Plan: 

$451,360,337 from the Child Care Stabilization Fund to help child care providers reopen or stay open, provide safe and healthy learning environments, keep workers on payroll, and provide mental health support for educators and children.
$281,637,028 in flexible funding from the Child Care Development Fund to help Alabama make child care more affordable for more families, increase access to high-quality care for families receiving subsidies, increase compensation for early childhood workers, and meet other care needs in the state. 

The American Rescue Plan also includes a historic increase in support for child care through the tax code, helping millions of working families afford needed care. Rep. Sewell played a critical role in drafting the expansions of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan, which are projected to cut child poverty in the United States by more than a half:
Last year, a family claiming a Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC) got less than $700 on average towards the cost of care, and many low-income working families often got nothing. Thanks to the historic expansion of the CDCTC in the American Recovery Plan, a median income family in Alabama with two kids under age 13 will receive up to $8,000 towards their child care expenses when they file taxes for 2021, compared with a previous maximum of $1,200. 

In 2020, the CDCTC provides a tax credit typically capped at $600 for one child for families with at least $3,000 in eligible expenses, and capped at $1,200 for two children or more for families with at least $6,000 in child care expenses.
Under the American Rescue Plan’s expansion of the CDCTC, all families with incomes below $125,000 will save up to half the cost of their eligible child care expenses, getting back up to $4,000 for one child and $8,000 for two or more children when they file taxes for 2021. Furthermore, families making between $125,000 and $438,000 can receive a partial credit.
For the first time, the CDCTC will be fully refundable, making the credit fairer by allowing low-income working families to receive the full value of the credit towards their eligible child care expenses regardless of how much they owe on their 2021 taxes.

73,Economy,Rep. Sewell Applauds Passage of Equal Pay Legislation,"April 15, 2021","Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Rep Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, landmark legislation to close loopholes and strengthen the 1963 Equal Pay Act, including providing effective remedies for women who are not being paid equally for equal work.
“Today I proudly voted to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act because women deserve the same respect and the same pay for the same work,” said Rep. Terri Sewell.  “In Alabama, full-time working women still earn just 74 cents, on average, for every dollar a man earns. This gap not only hurts women in our workforce, but threatens our state's economic growth. America succeeds when women succeed, and it is my hope the Senate will pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to ensure women receive equal pay for an equal day’s work.”
Background on the Paycheck Fairness Act: 
Throughout the United States, 58 years after the enactment of the Equal Pay Act, full-time working women still earn just 82 cents, on average, for every dollar a man earns, amounting to a yearly gap of $10,157 between full-time working men and women. In Alabama, the wage gap is even larger – 74 cents on the dollar, amounting to an annual gap of $12,857. The numbers are even more concerning for minority women: Black women are paid 59 cents, Hispanic women are paid 49 cents and Asian women are paid 81 cents for every dollar paid to white men in Alabama.
Specifically, the Paycheck Fairness Act:

Requires employers to prove that pay disparities exist for legitimate, job-related reasons.  In doing so, it ensures that employers who try to justify paying a man more than a woman for the same job must show the disparity is not sex-based, but job-related and necessary.
Bans retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages.
Ensures women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently available to those subjected to discrimination based on race and national origin.
Removes obstacles in the Equal Pay Act to facilitate a wronged worker’s participation in class action lawsuits that challenge systemic pay discrimination.
Makes improvements in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC’s) and the Department of Labor’s tools for enforcing the Equal Pay Act.
Provides assistance to all businesses to help them with their equal pay practices, recognizes excellence in pay practices by businesses, and empowers women and girls by creating a negotiation skills training program.
Prohibits employers from seeking salary history in determining future pay, so that pay discrimination does not follow women from job to job.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
74,Economy,Rep. Sewell Welcomes First Lady of the United States Dr. Jill Biden to Birmingham As Part of the American Rescue Plan Tour,"April 8, 2021","Birmingham, AL - Today, Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) welcomed First Lady of the United States Dr. Jill Biden to Birmingham to highlight the historic reduction in child poverty that will be achieved thanks to the American Rescue Plan. Rep. Sewell played a critical role in drafting the expansions of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan, which are projected to cut child poverty in the United States by more than a half. 
Rep. Terri Sewell: Good afternoon Birmingham! What a great day to welcome Dr. Jill Biden, the First Lady of the United States, to our wonderful city of Birmingham. 
As the only member of the Alabama Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of the 1.9 trillion dollar American Rescue Plan, here’s what I know for a fact: the people that I represent need assistance to get through COVID-19. I heard from them, and I know that they need money to be able to afford food on their tables and resources to make sure that they are equitably receiving the vaccine. 
Thank God that because of the American Rescue Plan, 1.9 trillion dollars were able to put shots in arms and in record time. You know the Biden-Harris Administration said that they were going to do 100 million shots in arms by the first 100 days. We were able to do it in 58 days! We also know that we needed direct funds to our state but also to our counties and our cities. I heard you Mr. Mayor and all of our mayors across the 7th Congressional District when they said they wanted direct resources and I am proud to announce that help is here!
Today I am thrilled to talk about another aspect of the American Rescue Plan. We knew that it was critically important that we help families, the whole family. We knew how important it was to help our children so the second round of $600 that went out in December, as well as the $1400 that went out just 2 weeks ago, include resources not just for the adults in the family, but for the children in the family as well. Through this plan, a family of 4 would receive not just the $1,400 for mom and dad, but for their children as well. That’s $5600 for an average family of four. 
Today I am proud to be right here at the YWCA and I want to thank LaRhonda and all of your staff for hosting us today. We started off at the James Rushton Early Learning Center at Woodlawn and I want to thank them and the Woodlawn Foundation for allowing us to see firsthand how our children are not only learning but they are thriving even in the midst of this pandemic. And that’s what it’s about. 
Under the leadership of LaRohanda and so many others, the YWCA of Central Alabama has had a profound impact on countless families and children in our region. As I said earlier today, we were at the Woodlawn Foundation’s James Rushton Early Learning Center, where we toured a classroom and met with children who are benefiting every day from this institution. For years they have dedicated themselves to revitalizing the community of Woodlawn and they are doing it. They’re not just talking about it—they are about it!
Also, I am thrilled to be with Alabama Child Advocate Liz Huntley who will introduce Dr. Biden in a minute. She is among the countless local leaders that are present here today as we talk about child poverty and the fact that the American Rescue Plan deals will deal with that directly. 
I see my dear friend, Senator Doug Jones: You will always be my Senator! And his lovely wife, Louise, thank you. 
The Biden Administration knows that the time is now to address the systemic inequities that have left so many families struggling to make it. Together with Congressional Democrats, we passed the American Rescue Plan because of our fundamental belief that good governance creates an environment that allows all of our people to reach their full potential. If we’ve learned anything during this pandemic, it’s that we cannot wait a single day to provide resources to America’s working and struggling families to try and level the playing field, especially for our children. That is why I'm so proud to have been the only Democrat in Alabama’s Delegation to vote in favor of the 1.9 trillion dollar American Rescue Plan. 
We know that one of the greatest contributors to the opportunity gap between children in communities like the one we’re in right now and the ones in wealthy neighborhoods across the nation is the financial investment the parents are able to make in their children. Every parent I met in my district, irrespective of zip code, wanted the best for their children, but they struggle day in and day out just to make ends meet. They fall behind when it matters most and we know that we need additional resources for our public schools.
I am proud that we are investing in our public schools not just immediately but also acknowledging that we need remedial help as well. Our children learn best in the classroom and we all know that which is why the American Rescue Plan will be giving direct assistance to individual school systems such as Jefferson County Public Schools and the City of Birmingham Public Schools. That is hundreds of millions of dollars and that money will be earmarked to not only deal with COVID-19 relief now to get our children back into schools safely, but also to deal with the remedial learning that we know our children will need. And so I want you all to know that the American Rescue Plan is truly that: a rescue plan to deal with COVID-19 and make sure our communities not only survive this pandemic, but they thrive through it!
As of 2019, 34% of the children in my district lived below the poverty line and 53% of those children, that's over half of the children in America, do not receive the full benefits of the Child Tax Credit because it isn’t fully refundable. We know that our response has to be big and bold in this rescue plan. 
It is important that we use every tool in the toolbox to deal with this pandemic and to provide relief. As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, our jurisdiction is taxes. It is the revenue-generating operation of the House, and we thought that it was critically important that we make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable. 
What do I mean by that? By making this Child Tax Credit fully refundable, we are reaching the neediest of families. We are not only doing that, we are also expanding it by providing direct payments in the form of a child allowance. This year families will receive $3,600 per child under the age of 6 and $3,000 per child for children between the ages of 6 and 16. These payments will be made on a recurring monthly basis with families receiving their first checks hopefully in July. 
This is about saving working families and ensuring our children get out of poverty. As a lifelong educator, I know that Dr. Jill Biden has dedicated herself to transforming the lives of American children. Now, as the First Lady, she has taken the same vigor and applied it to eradicating child poverty. We know that just by making the Child Tax Credit fully refundable that we can lift 40% of the children living below the poverty line above it. The American Rescue Plan not only provides help, but it also uplifts our community and it does so for our children as well. 
I want to say in closing that it was Martin Luther King that said, “poverty is a state of mind but, it also is a state of existence"" and we in the greatest country in the world, should not have anyone living in poverty. We need to figure out a way that we can provide the resources so that every child can grow up and reach their fullest potential. We see that with the wonderful children here at the YWCA and we saw that at the James Rushton Early Learning Center. 
I am so happy that Dr. Jill Biden chose to come to Alabama, to Birmingham, to tell us that the help that we’ve been looking for is here. It is going to be incumbent on all of us in this room to use those resources to the best of our ability to make sure that everyone gets through this pandemic.

75,Economy,Rep. Sewell Votes to Pass Two Historic Immigration Bills,"March 18, 2021","Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted to pass H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act, and H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, two landmark pieces of legislation to modernize and reform our immigration system. 
“Our country is at its strongest when we embrace our immigrant communities. I was proud today to vote in favor of two historic immigration bills that will strengthen protections for our Dreamers and our farmworkers,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis has inflicted a devastating toll on immigrant communities and essential frontline workers, including our farmworkers, making the protections in these bills vitally important.”
“The American Dream and Promise Act acknowledges the important contributions made by our nation’s Dreamers to our economy and to our communities by providing a lawful pathway to citizenship,” continued Sewell. “The Farm Workforce Modernization Act provides stability, predictability and fairness to the workers who feed America. These bills will work in tandem to ensure our immigrant communities can continue to pursue their American dream as they strengthen, enrich and contribute to our nation.”
The American Dream and Promise Act:.

Establishes a path to lawful permanent resident (LPR) status for Dreamers and for certain individuals who either held or were eligible for (Temporary Protected Status) TPS or (Deferred Enforced Departure) or DED.  The majority of these individuals have been in the United States for much of their lives, often with work authorization and temporary protections against deportation. Five years after attaining full LPR status, individuals are then eligible to apply for citizenship, a path that is supported by nearly 75 percent of the American public. 
Promotes justice and fairness for our nation’s Dreamers, and for the TPS and DED holders who fled ongoing armed conflict and other extraordinary conditions to come to this country. 

The Farm Workforce Modernization Act:

Stabilizes the agricultural sector and preserves our rural heritage by ensuring that farmers can meet their labor needs by establishing a program for agricultural workers, their spouses and minor children to earn legal Certified Agricultural Worker (CAW) status through continued agricultural employment.  
Reforms the H-2A temporary agricultural worker program to provide more flexibility for employers, while ensuring critical protections for workers.  
Establishes a mandatory, nationwide E-Verify system to ensure compliance with the reformed H-2A visa program while also protecting workers’ due process rights to ensure a legal workforce for the agriculture sector.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
76,Economy,"Rep. Sewell Speaks at Press Conference with RWDSU, Congressional Delegation to Support the Right of Amazon Workers in Bessemer to Unionize","March 4, 2021","Washington, D.C. - Today, Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) spoke at a press conference with RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum and Representatives Andy Levin (MI-09), Jamaal Bowman (NY-16), Cori Bush (MO-01), and Nikema Williams (GA-05) in support of Amazon employees' right to unionize in Bessemer. Below are Sewell’s remarks. 
Rep. Terri Sewell: I’m Congresswoman Terri Sewell, and I am honored each and every day to represent Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. I want to thank Stuart, I want to thank the workers from Amazon, and all of the organizers from RWDSU for the courage to stand with Alabama workers. 
The world is watching Alabama, and I want you to know that these workers are following a rich tradition—a tradition of civil rights and human rights of crusading against something that is wrong. This weekend, we celebrate the 56th Anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. I know that Alabama workers, like Kevin, Jennifer, and Darryl, all of these Amazon workers, stand in the same tradition as John Lewis, as Amelia Boynton Robinson, as those Foot Soldiers that dared to change the world by having the audacity to stand up for their rights. 
I am welcomed today by a delegation from Congress who are standing with these workers, and we have one message. Our message is: We see you! We hear you, Alabama workers! And we are with you! We are with you!
I just want all of you to know that it is a basic human right, the right to organize, and it is in my DNA. I am the daughter of educators, and if it wasn’t for the Alabama Education Association, AEA, my mother and my father would not have been able to integrate public schools in Alabama in order to be teachers, in order to be coaches, in order to be guidance counselors.
It is important that the people of Alabama know that workers have rights. It is because of unions that we have a five day work week. It is because of unions that we have safer conditions in our places of work. It is because of unions that we have benefits. 
And so, all we ask is that, free of intimidation, the people of Alabama, Amazon workers, have the right to choose whether or not they organize—free of intimidation, free of interference. That is what we want. 
I want to thank my colleagues for joining me, and today I’m with four of them: Congressman Andy Levin from Michigan; Congressman Jamaal Bowman from New York; Congresswoman Nikema Williams from Georgia; and Congresswoman Cori Bush from Missouri. 
We proudly stand with Alabama workers in Bessemer, Alabama because we know, we know, that standing up for the right of people to organize and collectively bargain is a God-given right for anyone who is working in America. And we look forward to going back to Congress and passing the PRO Act, which would streamline the NLRB, and stop companies from intimidating their workers. 
It’s critically important that you all know that we all stand on the shoulders of John Lewis, who said if you see something that ain’t right, that’s not just, we have a moral obligation to do something about it.
So, we stand in solidarity with the workers. It’s critically important that you all know that we don’t stand alone. The world is watching Alabama once again. And, once again, my district, Birmingham and Bessemer, it is so important that the world knows that once again, Alabama is standing up for civil rights, and for human rights.

77,Economy,Rep. Sewell Votes in Favor of the Updated Heroes Act,"September 30, 2020","Washington, D.C. - Today, Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted in favor of the Updated Heroes Act, House Democrats’ latest legislation to address the ongoing needs that have resulted from the COVID-19 public health crisis. This bill reflects current negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, as well as needs that have risen since the original Heroes Act passed the House of Representatives in May 2020.
“It is unfortunate that the White House and Senate Republicans have not been willing to compromise to provide additional money for ongoing relief to our communities, workers, and families,” Sewell said. “With passage of the Updated Heroes Act today, House Democrats’ have given the White House and Senate Republicans one more chance to pass another stimulus bill that will continue to provide critical relief for the American people.” 
“The provisions in the Updated Heroes Act are essential to avert greater economic and health catastrophe for families, schools, small businesses, essential workers, and health care providers in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District,” Sewell continued. “Not only does this legislation deliver much-needed resources to Alabama counties and cities, it also reflects House Democrats’ willingness to compromise in good faith to ensure our country can weather this ongoing crisis.”  
The Updated Heroes Act would provide counties and cities in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District with $396 million in funding to cover coronavirus-related outlays and revenue loss and pay our health care workers, library staff, law enforcement, fire, transportation, EMS, teachers and other vital workers who keep us safe and are in danger of losing their jobs. A town-by-town breakdown of the estimated funding allocations for the 7th District under the Updated Heroes Act is available here.
In addition to resources for our state, local, tribal and territorial governments, the Updated Heroes Act maintains key priorities from the original version of the legislation that passed the House in May. The bill also provides families with a second round of direct payments of $1,200 for each individual and $500 for each dependent, and extends weekly $600 federal unemployment payments through January 2021. 
Among the bill’s many provisions, it:


Provides strong support for small businesses by improving the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to serve the smallest businesses and struggling non-profits, providing hard-hit businesses with second loans, and delivering targeted assistance for the struggling restaurant industry and independent live venue operators.


More funds to bolster education and child care, with $225 billion for education – including $182 billion for K12 schools and nearly $39 billion for postsecondary education – and $57 billion to support child care for families.


Supports testing, tracing and treatment, through $75 billion for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and isolation measures, with special attention to the disparities facing communities of color, ensuring every American can access free coronavirus treatment, and supporting hospitals and providers. The updated bill also includes $28 billion for procurement, distribution and education campaigns for a safe and effective vaccine.


Protects payrolls, by enhancing the new employee retention tax credit that encourages employers to keep employees on payroll.


Preserves health coverage, protecting Americans losing their employer-provided health insurance by making unemployed Americans automatically receive the maximum ACA subsidy on the exchanges, as well as a special enrollment period in the ACA exchanges for uninsured Americans.


Strengthens food security, addressing rising hunger with a 15 percent increase to the maximum SNAP benefit and additional funding for nutrition programs that help families put food on the table as well as targeted support for farmers and producers impacted by the crisis.


Safeguards our democracy, with new resources to ensure safe elections, an accurate Census, and preserve the Postal Service.

78,Economy,FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Rep. Sewell Votes to Keep Government Open and Extend Vital Programs,"September 22, 2020","Washington, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Sewell voted in support of the continuing resolution legislation H.R. 8337, which provides for the continuation of funding for the programs contained in the 12 annual appropriation acts for FY2020. The bill passed the House in a final vote of 359-57-1.
 
“I voted for today’s legislation to avert a catastrophic government shutdown and fund the critical programs that my constituents depend on. At a time when our country is in the middle of a pandemic and millions of Americans are losing their homes and livelihoods to natural disasters, including hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, our government needs to be fully funded and operational so that the American people can get the resources they need,” said Rep. Sewell. “I am particularly proud of the provisions Democrats secured to save our seniors from a Medicare Part B premium hike, protect health, housing, and other programs for Veterans, and to provide repayment relief for our health care providers at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic.” 
 
“While I’m disappointed that Senate Republicans and White House didn’t come to the table to agree to pass the long-term FY2021 funding bills that the House passed earlier this year, I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure a long-term funding bill is passed before this CR expires in December. Additionally, an agreement on further Coronavirus relief legislation is desperately needed. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs and as the pandemic continues, municipalities, health care providers, essential workers, and small businesses are running out of resources from the CARES Act and relief is needed now.” 
 
A list of the programs that Congresswoman Sewell worked directly with House appropriators to secure in the FY2020 funding bill, which are extended by today’s continuing resolution, H.R. 8337, can be found here. Today’s bill includes several other funding provisions that Congresswoman Sewell fought in recent months to secure and that benefit the 7th District, including funding and extensions for the following programs, among others.

Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children (Summer EBT) program
Commodity Supplemental Food program
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program
2020 Decennial Census Program

79,Economy,VIDEO: Rep. Sewell's Trade Bill with Caribbean Basin Countries Passes House with Bipartisan Support,"September 21, 2020","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) applauded the passage of H.R. 991, a bipartisan bill, she introduced to reauthorize the U.S. Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) until September 2030. The legislation passed the House by unanimous voice vote.
 
The CBTPA is a preferential trade agreement that provides for duty and quota-free access for apparel products manufactured in designated beneficiary Caribbean Basin region countries. CBTPA also requires that Caribbean Basin countries use U.S. formed yarns, fabrics, and thread. The CBTPA was first enacted in 2000 and is currently authorized through September 30, 2020. Eligible CBTPA countries include Barbados, Belize, Curacao, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago.
 
“As the lead sponsor of the legislation to reauthorize the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, I am thrilled that Congress is taking action on this issue before the program expires at the end of the month,"" said Rep. Sewell. ""CBTPA is such an important economic tool for the United States and each of our partner countries, and it is critical to our continued diplomatic relationships in the Caribbean Basin. The bipartisan effort to reauthorize this program will allow us to export more American-made goods and strengthen Western supply chains, while contributing to economic development and job creation in Haiti and other countries throughout the Caribbean Basin region. I am grateful for its passage by unanimous voice vote in the House, and I urge the Senate to take up this bill before the September 30th deadline. ”
 
""I am incredibly grateful for Congresswoman Sewell's commitment to economic prosperity in the Republic of Haiti and the Caribbean region. The Extension of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA), H.R. 991, which has received bipartisan and bicameral support, is a testament to Congress' unwavering support for working families in Haiti and CARICOM countries. This legislation has created countless jobs and generated billions of dollars in revenue over the past decade,” said Ambassador Herve Denis.
 
""Furthermore, CBTPA would play a crucial role in strengthening the supply chains for PPEs and textiles in response to COVID-19, making America less dependent on nations outside the Western Hemisphere. With the issues regarding China, Haiti hopes and expects to benefit from the ""Near-Shoring"" concept introduced by Congress. Together, we can continue to strengthen bilateral trade relations between two of the oldest republics in the Americas.""
 
“I’m proud to support our nation’s trade preference programs, which bolster further economic expansion in developing nations and support jobs here in America – a true win-win scenario,” said Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), Republican lead co-sponsor. “In particular, our bipartisan bill to extend the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act accomplishes that goal in the Caribbean, providing trade benefits to eight Caribbean nations, most notably Haiti. I want to thank Congresswoman Terri Sewell for partnering with me on this important legislation and urge the Senate to consider it without delay.”
 
Together, the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) and the CBTPA are collectively known as the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). These two acts work together to facilitate the development of 17 independent countries of the Caribbean Basin region. For these two preferential trade programs to be effective, both CBTPA and CBERA must be authorized. Eligible CBERA countries include Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the British Virgin Islands, Curacao, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago.

80,Economy,Rep. Sewell votes for tenth time to re-open the government,"January 22, 2019","WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) cast her tenth vote Wednesday to re-open the government and ensure federal workers are guaranteed the pay they are due.
“I have voted ten times to re-open our government since Congress convened on January 3rd,” Sewell said. “On Friday, many of our federal workers will miss their second paycheck. The President and Senator Mitch McConnell may not understand what missing a single paycheck means – let alone two – but for many in Alabama’s 7th District and around the country, their failure to act is absolutely devastating.”
“I have met with federal workers in my district who are depending on us to do our jobs and re-open the government as soon as possible,” Sewell said. “I am calling on Senate Republicans to put partisan politics aside and vote on the House bills we passed so that our federal workers get the pay they are due.”
Earlier this week, Sewell heard directly from some of the 800,000 federal workers impacted by the shutdown. She met with TSA employees at both the Montgomery Regional and Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airports who have been working without pay for nearly a month as a result of the Trump government shutdown. Sewell provided the TSA officers with breakfast and lunch to thank them for their hard work despite the difficult circumstances.
Late Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced the Senate will vote on House-passed legislation on Thursday, marking the first votes the Republican-controlled Senate will take to re-open the government.

81,Economy,"Selma Time-Journal Op-Ed: Our Federal Workers are not political pawns, Mr. President.","January 21, 2019","Our Federal Workers are not political pawns, Mr. President.
By Rep. Terri A. Sewell 
In the Selma Times-Journal
Americans deserve a well-functioning Congress that works on their behalf. I know my constituents in Alabama’s 7th District did not send me to Washington to be a party to the problem, but to seek solutions. That is why I am working every day to reopen government and allow hardworking federal employees to work and ensure government services continue uninterrupted.
I voted to re-open the government and fund border security the moment Congress went into session on Jan. 3. Since then, I have voted an additional eight times to ensure our federal workers receive their due pay government gets back to work.
To be clear, I support investing in our nation’s border security. Just last summer, I voted for $1.6 billion to enhance our existing border security infrastructure and supported a bipartisan proposal to implement smart measures to ensure our Customs and Border Protection agents have the resources needed to effectively police the southern border. In July 2018, I went to the Texas border, toured detention centers and a port of entry, and met with border patrol agents there.  
Democrats and Republicans agree: we need to invest in our strategic infrastructure – state-of-the-art technologies to detect tunnels; sensors and radars to spot moving people and objects; and drones equipped with the technology to surveil areas that otherwise would be difficult to monitor. Equally as important, we need to provide adequate resources to combat the entry of terrorists and criminals into our country through our airports and other borders.
So, when the President says that Democrats are against securing our southern border, he is being dishonest. However, real border security will not come in the form of a medieval brick-and-mortar wall.
	What Republicans and the President do not seem to understand is that the irresponsible Trump shutdown is impacting the wellbeing of over 800,000 federal workers and their families who depend on a steady paycheck, and countless others who depend on essential government services affected by the shutdown.
For example, the Federal Bureau of Prisons is the largest employer in Pickens County, AL, which is located in my district. Those federal corrections officers are worried about being able to pay their monthly expenses, like their mortgages and essential health care costs. We also have countless other federal agencies impacted by the shutdown, including TSA, which impacts hardworking men and women in our airports, like agents in our Birmingham and Montgomery airports.
The negative side effects go on. The shutdown is having a rippling effect on local businesses all over the country, including those in the urban and rural parts of our district that depend on federal workers to keep their businesses open. Additionally, over 800,000 Alabamians rely on SNAP benefits to feed their families. If the shutdown continues, too many will be left without the support they need to put food on the table.
While it’s difficult for President Trump to understand why the average American can’t go without pay, the reality in Alabama is that many of my constituents live paycheck-to-paycheck regardless of how hard they work. Many are one financial emergency away from financial ruin. It is irresponsible that this Trump shutdown, now the longest in history, was completely avoidable.
	The status quo is unacceptable. Federal workers are not political pawns.
I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find a real path forward, but we need a willing partner in the White House who appreciates the hardship he is causing everyday Americans.  
	It’s time for President Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell to put politics aside and take up the House-passed bills to end the shutdown NOW! Our communities and workers deserve better. Our nation deserves better.

82,Economy,USDA Announces $23.4 Million for Uniontown Wastewater Solution,"November 16, 2018","WASHINGTON, D.C.– On Friday, November 16, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a $23.4 million grant to address an ongoing wastewater treatment crisis in Uniontown, Alabama. USDA will work with the municipality to create an outside board which will oversee the development of a new wastewater system for Uniontown residents. Earlier this year, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) helped secure an increase of $1.8 billion in an omnibus funding bill for USDA water and wastewater infrastructure projects.
“Today’s grant announcement is a huge victory for Uniontown that will have a real-life impact for thousands of Alabamians living in the rural Black Belt,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “Thank you to Senators Richard Shelby and Doug Jones, Congressman Robert Aderholt, USDA State Rural Development Director Chris Beeker, and all of the state and local stakeholders who helped to make this investment possible. No American family should have to live without access to safe wastewater treatment in the 21st Century.  I have met with families in rural Alabama who struggle with the health and economic challenges created by failing wastewater systems. Every day, their stories inspire my fight in Congress for stronger investments in our wastewater infrastructure. USDA’s assistance in Uniontown is an important step forward, but the wastewater crisis facing Alabama’s rural Black Belt is not over. We must continue fighting for Uniontown, Lowndes County, and all of our state’s residents who have to live with inadequate basic resources.”
For over a decade, failing wastewater infrastructure has created enormous health and economic challenges for communities in rural Alabama. Since 2016, the issue has received national and international attention, with the release of a United Nations-sponsored report this year highlighting the failure of wastewater infrastructure in Alabama’s rural Black Belt.
In March, Rep. Sewell worked with House appropriators to secure $1.8 billion in additional funding for water and wastewater infrastructure under USDA as part of an omnibus spending bill. Rep. Sewell has also toured the spray fields in Uniontown and homes in Lowndes County to survey failing and inadequate wastewater systems. In May, the Congresswoman held a health fair in Hayneville, AL with Sen. Jones to raise public awareness about the health consequences associated with failing septic systems and wastewater contamination.
Rep. Sewell has made the repair of wastewater infrastructure a top priority since she was first elected to Congress. In 2013, Rep. Sewell helped White Hall in Lowndes County secure a $1 million grant and $112K loan through the Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program (USDA) which was used to connect 50 homes and businesses to the municipal sewer lines.

“A year after the hurricanes hit, too many families in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are still without clean water, without power, and without roofs on their homes,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “Our delegation visit will bring attention to this ongoing crisis and needed oversight to federal recovery efforts. This Administration’s neglect for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands after they were devastated by Hurricane Maria is nothing short of disgraceful. We have a responsibility to help our fellow Americans recover from one of the worst natural disasters of this decade. As another hurricane season approaches, the need for action is urgent.”

84,Economy,"Rep. Sewell Introduces Bipartisan Bill to Boost Post-Graduation Scholarships, Strengthen Workforce Recruitment in Rural America","July 24, 2018","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Tuesday, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) and Congressman Darin LaHood (R-IL) introduced H.R. 6486, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to exclude certain post-graduation scholarship grants from being treated as gross income and, in turn, help recruit professionals into the workforce, help alleviate student loan debt, and promote economic growth in communities. This legislation would create parity for student loan payments with how scholarship payments made by foundations are currently treated under the tax code.
“Today’s bill takes a smart approach to building a skilled workforce in underserved communities while at the same time tackling our nation’s student debt crisis,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “By providing tax relief to recipients of post-graduation scholarships, our bipartisan legislation supports programs which recruit skilled graduates to work in struggling communities where they are needed most. For our rural hospitals, which struggle so often to recruit medical professionals, programs like these are a critical pipeline of talent. I am proud to have worked with my Republican colleague Rep. Darin LaHood to introduce today’s bill, and I look forward to continuing our fight to strengthen America’s workforce and invest in rural and underserved communities.”
“This bipartisan legislation will not only help recruit talent to often underserved areas and professions, relieve individuals of student loan debt, and help foster economic development to particular regions, but charitable organizations will be provided greater flexible to serve their unique communities,” stated Rep. Darin LaHood. “With this amendment to the tax code, foundations and charitable organizations across the 18th District will be able to attract greater talent and reward professionals for committing to their local communities. I want to thank my Democratic colleague Rep. Sewell for co-authoring this bi-partisan legislation with me and I look forward to working together to get this legislation passed.”
A post-graduation scholarship is a type of charitable grant that foundations would make to attract individuals with career skills needed in a region to build their careers in that community. It functions much like a traditional scholarship, but would pay off a portion of student loans held by an individual who has already completed a degree or technical program.

85,Economy,Rep. Sewell Leads Bipartisan Letter Opposing Auto Tariffs,"July 18, 2018","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Wednesday, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL), Congresswoman Jackie Walorski (R-IN), Congressman Ron Kind (D-WI), and Congressman Mike Kelly (R-PA) led a bipartisan letter, cosigned by 149 Members of Congress, to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross expressing concern with the Section 232 investigation into the import of automobiles and automobile parts. The letter highlights the auto industry’s importance to American working families and the nation’s economy and the vast network of international suppliers that the industry relies on to stay competitive.
Read the full text of the Sewell-Walorski letter to the Trump Administration opposing auto tariffs.
“President Trump’s proposed auto tariffs would drive an estimated 195,000 jobs out of the United States and wreck Alabama’s growing manufacturing base,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “I’m proud to see Republicans and Democrats standing together in support of auto workers and against the Trump Administration’s reckless and isolationist trade policy. In my home state of Alabama, the car manufacturing sector provides tens of thousands of workers a skilled job with good wages and good benefits. Rather than endangering those jobs through a trade war with our allies, we need to strengthen our trading relationships to better position U.S. workers in the global marketplace.”
Economists estimate that a 25 percent tariff on all foreign automobiles and auto parts would cost 195,000 American jobs.  Moreover, if countries chose to retaliate, as they have with recent tariffs, economists say that 624,000 American jobs could be lost. Alabama's automotive manufacturing sector is approaching nearly 40,000 jobs and motor vehicle exports topped $7.75 billion in 2017.

86,Economy,Rep. Sewell Proposal Passes in IRS Reform Package,"April 18, 2018","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Wednesday, April 18, the House of Representatives passed the Taxpayer First Act, a legislative package which strengthens transparency and accountability at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and improves taxpayer services. The bill includes a provision proposed by Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) and Congressman Jason Smith (R-MO) originally introduced as the Preserving Taxpayers' Rights Act. Rep. Sewell voted for the underlying bill when it passed the House in a bipartisan vote.
“This legislation is a chance for us to strengthen the relationship many taxpayers have with the IRS,” said Rep. Sewell. “Tax season is a stressful time for millions of Americans, and the compliance burden on the average American and small business owner is unnecessarily difficult. Today, Congress took important steps to make the tax filing experience more sensible, fairer, and more efficient. The bill we passed today includes a bipartisan provision which I drafted with Rep. Jason Smith that improves efficiency and customer service at the IRS and gives taxpayers a chance to resolve disputes with the IRS without being forced to litigate in court. While our fight for a friendlier, more efficient tax system is not over, today’s vote is a victory for all taxpayers.”
The Preserving Taxpayers' Rights Act, which was included in the underlying legislation that passed the House today, contains provisions which 1) maintain taxpayers’ legal right to have cases heard by the IRS Office of Appeals; 2) further define which IRS cases can be designated for litigation; 3) further define when tax liability assessments can be levied; and 4) eliminate the use of outside law firms for federal tax audits.

Sewell (D-AL) will attend the 6th round of negotiations for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in Montreal. NAFTA, which governs trade between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, has a substantial impact on Alabama’s economy. Canada is Alabama’s largest export market, and Mexico is Alabama’s 4th largest export market.
“This weekend, I am attending the 6th round of NAFTA negotiations to make sure that working families in my district have a seat at the table when it comes to our country’s biggest economic decisions,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “I support modernizing NAFTA and I believe our country can negotiate an agreement that brings better wages and better jobs to Alabama. For auto workers, steel workers, and farmers in my district, these talks will have lasting impacts, and I will be pushing for strong and enforceable trade laws that protect their industries. While progress has been made in the past five rounds of negotiations, I hope that all three countries can use this weekend to address many of the more contentious issues in front of us.”
Alabama’s exports to Canada and Mexico have increased by $5.6 billion since NAFTA first went into effect in 1994. For the Birmingham metro area, global exports account for $1.9 billion in economic activity.

Watch Rep. Sewell’s speech on Tuesday opposing the GOP tax bill in the House of Representatives
“Today’s revote is another example of how Republican leaders have rushed a haphazard tax bill through Congress which will impact our entire economy. This bill is not reform, it’s a partisan scam that will have decades-long repercussions for America’s working families.”
“It is unconscionable that Republican leaders are willing to throw away $1.5 trillion on tax cuts for special interests when they aren’t willing to extend funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or ALL Kids as it’s known in Alabama. For a tenth of what this tax bill costs, Congress could have stopped CHIP from expiring and saved healthcare for millions of children. Instead, families in my district will be getting ALL Kids cancellation notices for Christmas. Children’s lives are at risk, but Republican leaders have prioritized tax cuts for the wealthy.

89,Economy,House Passes Sewell Manufactured Housing Reform,"November 30, 2017","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Friday, the House passed the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act (H.R. 1699) in a bipartisan vote. Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) is the lead Democratic co-sponsor and Congressman Andy Barr (R-KY) is the lead Republican sponsor on the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act.
“Passage of today’s bill means working families will be one step closer to affordable housing,” said Rep. Sewell. “In Alabama, over 300,000 families rely on manufactured homes for quality, independent, affordable housing, but current rules make access to credit for purchasing manufactured homes more difficult. The Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act ensures that manufactured housing remains an affordable option by bringing needed reform to federal mortgage regulations while preserving consumer protections that prevent predatory lending.”
The Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act would ensure that manufactured home loans are not unfairly categorized as high-cost loans. This inappropriate categorization restricts the availability of credit for the purchase of manufactured homes, eliminating an option for affordable housing for working families.
 The Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act does not alter protections against predatory lending. It leaves in place considerable consumer protections including the Truth in Lending Act’s “Ability to Repay” requirement, the prohibition against steering a consumer to a loan that has “predatory characteristics,” loan term disclosures, the prohibition on mandatory arbitration, as well as the authority of the CFPB to prosecute unfair, deceptive abusive acts and practices.

90,Economy,House passes tax bill raising deficit by $1.7 trillion,"November 16, 2017","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Thursday, the House of Representatives passed Republican tax legislation which will add $1.7 trillion to the national debt according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. Analysis by the Tax Policy Center shows that 36 million middle-class and working families, or more than one out of every four taxpayers nationally, will experience a tax increase under the tax bill by 2027.
Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) releases the following statement:
“The Republican tax bill which passed the House today is nothing more than a giveaway for corporate special interests at the expense of America’s working families,” said Rep. Sewell. “By eliminating popular deductions like the student loan interest deduction and the medical expense deduction and by limiting mortgage interest deductions for homeowners, this bill betrays our middle-class families. This legislation pays for unsustainable tax breaks by erasing proven economic incentives that distressed communities rely on, like the New Market Tax Credit, the historic tax credit, private activity bonds, and bond provisions that cities and municipalities rely on to fund the construction of public projects. Our tax code is a reflection of our values, but this legislation values special interests over the economic interests of our constituents. This will add $1.7 trillion to the deficit which is likely to result in massive cuts to programs like Medicare, SNAP, and Social Security. While today’s bill is a raw deal for Alabama’s working families, I will continue fighting for real tax reform that benefits all Americans.”
Watch Rep. Sewell’s floor remarks on the Republican tax bill during debate.
During the markup of the Republican tax bill in the Committee on Ways and Means, Rep. Sewell offered three historically bipartisan amendments. All Democratic amendments, including the three amendments offered by Rep. Sewell, were rejected without a single Republican vote.

91,Economy,Rep. Sewell Statement on GOP Tax Bill Markup,"November 9, 2017","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Thursday, the House Ways and Means Committee passed the Republican tax bill after just four days of markup. During markup, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) offered three historically bipartisan amendments. All Democratic amendments, including the three offered by Rep. Sewell, were rejected without a single Republican vote. The tax bill passed the Committee by a 24-16 vote, without any bipartisan changes allowed by Republicans.
“I’m disappointed that all Democratic amendments, even the most modest, bipartisan changes that I offered to help ordinary, middle-class Americans, were reflexively opposed by Republicans,” said Rep. Sewell. “Republicans have thrown away an opportunity for bipartisan work on tax reform, and chose instead to pass a bill that provides tax breaks for powerful special interests at the expense of working Americans, small businesses, and local economies . In order to cut taxes for Washington special interests, the tax bill adds $2.3 trillion to the national debt and cuts popular tax deductions like the medical expense deduction, the student loan deduction, limits the mortgage interest deduction, and erases incentives that have been proven to spur local economic development.”
“The tax code is a reflection of our values, and this week’s Republican tax bill valued special interests and the wealthy over everyday Americans. That is why I introduced amendments to refocus the tax bill on helping working families and middle-class Americans. My amendments to promote workforce development, to equip state and local governments with the tools needed to invest in infrastructure and public works, and to save the historic preservation tax credit were commonsense solutions. I was truly disappointed to see Republicans reject our input and rush this severely flawed bill out of Committee. As this bill heads to a vote before the full House, I will continue fighting for real reform, and against cuts that will harm Alabama’s working families.”
On Tuesday, Rep. Sewell offered an amendment to create a tax credit encouraging employers to invest in human capital and workforce training through apprenticeships. The amendment is modeled after the Workforce Development Tax Credit Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Rep. Sewell to reduce the skills gap and train American workers to compete in 21st Century jobs.
On Wednesday, Rep. Sewell offered an amendment to restore the ability of state and local governments to save taxpayer money and increase their ability to invest in infrastructure projects by refinancing debt.
On Thursday, Rep. Sewell offered an amendment to restore and expand the historic preservation tax credit, a key redevelopment tool that encourages private sector investment in rehabilitation and reuse of historic buildings. Nationwide, the historic preservation tax credit has restored over 42,000 buildings, and in Alabama the tax credit has funded 128 restoration projects since 2002.

REMARKS & QUOTES

Rep. Sewell Introduces Workforce Development Amendment (WATCH NOW):
		“My amendment is the type of bipartisan incentive that the tax code needs to lower the cost of training for employers, and encourage the type of investment in human capital that is desperately needed in our workforce. Left unaddressed, unfilled middle skills jobs will go to other workers in other countries because we have fallen behind in our investment in the preparation and development of our workers.”
Rep. Sewell Shares Constituent Stories on Adoption Tax Credit (WATCH NOW):
		“The fact of the matter is that over 1,000 adoptions occur every year in the state of Alabama, and most of those families receive the adoption tax credit. So many of those families have flooded our office with calls for the last day or so. I wanted to read for the record some of the comments that my constituents have made.”
Rep. Sewell Questions GOP on State and Local Tax Deduction (WATCH NOW):
		“Why is it that our colleagues on the other side won’t answer the questions, why are you willing to take away the state and local tax deduction from middle-class families but not willing to do the same for businesses? As I said in my opening statement, this is about values. What do you value? What they’re saying is that they would rather value businesses over middle-class and working families. That’s unacceptable.”

WHAT TO EXPECT TOMORROW
The Ways & Means Committee will continue consideration of the Republican tax bill tomorrow. Rep. Sewell will offer amendments to protect the New Markets Tax Credit and the ability of state and local governments to save taxpayer money by refinancing debt. Consideration of amendments to the Republican tax bill is expected to go into the night on Wednesday.

REMARKS & QUOTES

Rep. Sewell Calls for Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (WATCH NOW):
		“The Earned Income Tax Credit is a great program that rewards work. So often, we want folks to get off of government assistance and work. And this is a program that encourages those who are working to continue to work and provide for their families. This program is a powerful tool for economic opportunity.”
Rep. Sewell Offers Advanced Bond Refunding Amendment (WATCH NOW):
		“Private activity bonds, along with advanced refundings, as well as New Market Tax Credits, and historic tax credits are really useful tools for helping to get public projects done. It’s a way of not only incentivizing investment in infrastructure, but it also is a lifeline of so many public entities that we represent. Everything from cities and counties to hospitals and universities. It’s really important for low-income housing. These are really important financing tools.”
Rep. Sewell Supports Student Loan Tax Deduction Amendment (WATCH NOW):
		“As the proud daughter of two long-time educators, and the proud product of public schools in Alabama, I know the power of public education. I support Mr. Doggett’s amendment because I believe it is the best way we can support better teaching and education in America. I have a deep concern about this Administration’s attempt to divert public dollars to private, often unaccountable schools. H.R. 1 doubles down on that agenda.”

WHAT TO EXPECT TOMORROW
The Ways & Means Committee will finish consideration of the Republican tax bill tomorrow. The Chairman will offer a final manager’s amendment, the text of which has not yet been shared publicly. After limited time for debate, the Chairman will force a final vote on the amendment. After passing the Ways & Means Committee, the Speaker of the House will place the bill on the calendar for a vote before the full House.

BACKGROUND: After months of secret negotiations, Republican leadership introduced tax legislation last week that provides large tax cuts favoring special interests and wealthy individuals. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the GOP tax plan would add over $1.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. Analysis indicates that the GOP tax bill would actually raise taxes on nearly 13 million tax filers who earn $100,000 a year or less. The tax bill also proposes the elimination of important credits for education, homeownership, medical expenses, development in struggling communities, and more.

95,Economy,Rep. Sewell Statement on Republican Tax Bill,"November 1, 2017","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Thursday, Republicans in the House of Representatives introduced tax legislation that would provide large tax cuts favoring special interests and wealthy individuals.
Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) releases the following statement:
“After months of secret negotiations, it should come as no surprise that the tax plan revealed by Republican leaders today is a raw deal for Alabama and for working families across this nation. The Republican tax bill will raise costs on families who can least afford it while providing wealthy individuals and special interests a windfall in tax breaks,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “In order to pay for what would be the largest tax giveaway to special interests in American history, the Republican tax plan promises to make cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and the programs that middle-class families rely on. We cannot afford poorly targeted tax cuts and we cannot afford to miss our chance for true bipartisan tax reform. While I disagree with a number of the points in today’s tax plan, I will work with my colleagues to try to reshape this bill so that it helps working families and encourages growth across the entire economy in a fiscally-responsible way.”

96,Economy,Rep. Sewell Statement on Passage of Republican Budget,"October 26, 2017","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Thursday, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) voted against the Republican budget, which passed the House of Representatives without Democratic support.
“I voted against today’s budget because it trades away critical investments in infrastructure, education, job-training, and health care programs in exchange for short-sighted tax cuts for special interests and the wealthy,” said Rep. Sewell. “As our country faces serious fiscal challenges, we need to make responsible budgeting decisions that build a foundation for job growth, better wages, and improved economic and health outcomes. Instead, today’s budget relies on gimmicks and irresponsible cuts to make way for a special interest tax plan that adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit.”
“For our state in particular, the Republican budget will have a devastating impact on hardworking families, businesses, hospitals, and schools. This budget would slash Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion, impacting over a million Alabamians who rely on these programs for care. The budget also cuts $37 billion in funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), through which our district receives more than $240 million annually for health research. Put simply, this budget pays for tax cuts for special interests and the wealthy on the backs of Alabama’s working families.”

97,Economy,Rep. Sewell Statement on Ryan-McConnell Tax Plan,"September 27, 2017","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Wednesday, GOP congressional leaders outlined their plan for an overhaul of the federal tax code. Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) releases the following statement:
“While the Ryan-McConnell tax outline released today is short on details, it is clear that the plan prioritizes tax cuts for the wealthy over relief for working families and small businesses,” said Rep. Sewell. “Tax reform should be an opportunity to help hardworking Americans and to build a more competitive economy. Instead, the GOP plan cuts taxes for top earners and leaves Congress to balance the budget on the backs of the middle class.
“The Ryan-McConnell plan eliminates the alternative minimum tax for high-income individuals at an estimated cost of $413 billion over the next decade. The plan also recommends reducing the top tax bracket from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, a benefit helping only those tax filers earning over $470,000. Altogether, the tax giveaway proposed by Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell would increase the deficit by an estimated $2.2 trillion, leaving future generations with the bill.”
“Just yesterday, I met with President Trump at the White House, where the President promised that his tax plan would not be a tax cut for the wealthy. I plan on holding the President to his word. We cannot miss an opportunity for tax reform that puts working families and small businesses first.”
On Tuesday, Rep. Sewell joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House to discuss tax reform priorities. Rep. Sewell is a member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.

98,Economy,Rep. Sewell Introduces Bipartisan Caribbean Trade Bill,"September 27, 2017","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Wednesday, Congresswoman Terri Sewell (D-AL) joined Republican Congressman Carlos Curbelo (R-FL) to introduce the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (H.R. 3849) to reauthorize the U.S. Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) until 2030. Since 2000, CBTPA has allowed for the duty- and quota-free import of goods from Caribbean countries made with U.S. yarns, fabrics, and threads.
“This bipartisan legislation to promote U.S. trade with Caribbean island countries is needed as many islands begin to recover from the devastation of recent hurricanes,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “Economic growth in Alabama is one of my top priorities, and this bill represents a great opportunity to expand my home state’s trade with Caribbean basin countries. Reauthorizing CBTPA until 2030 and improving trade with countries like Haiti encourages future investment, promotes job creation, and lays the foundation for economic development for decades to come. Since coming to Congress, I’ve worked to build a stronger, more competitive U.S. economy and today’s bill takes a big step towards that goal.”
Background information on the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act:
The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (H.R. 3849) would reauthorize the U.S. Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) until 2030, giving duty and quota-free access to apparel products manufactured in certain Caribbean countries.  In return, CBTPA requires that Caribbean Basin countries use U.S. formed yarns, fabrics, and thread.  Eligible CBTPA countries include Barbados, Belize, Curacao, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago.
CBTPA works in conjunction with the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) to facilitate the development of 17 independent countries of the Caribbean Basin region.  For these two preferential trade programs to be effective, both CBTPA and CBERA must be authorized. Eligible CBERA countries include Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the British Virgin Islands, Curacao, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago.

Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) sits on the Ways & Means Committee and joined the meeting, which also included Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) and Ranking Member Richard Neal (D-MA).
“My constituents deserve tax reform that gives working families and small businesses the relief they need, not another tax cut for the wealthy. Working families in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District have been waiting too long for tax cuts for the wealthy to ‘trickle-down’ to them,” said Rep. Sewell. “As Congress considers tax reform legislation, I will work to advance policies that incentivize workforce development and enhance the earned income tax credit so that it better serves middle and working class Americans.”
“I have always said, if you’re not at the table then you’re on the menu. Today’s meeting was a chance to talk with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle about some of the bipartisan tax reform proposals I have introduced and the needs of my constituents. I strongly disagree with a number of the points in President Trump’s proposed tax outline. But I will not miss an opportunity to be a strong voice for tax reform that puts my constituents and other working-class Americans first.”
Rep. Sewell has introduced the bipartisan Workforce Development Tax Credit Act (H.R. 1781) with Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-AL). This legislation prepares the workforce for manufacturing jobs by providing federal tax credits for businesses that offer apprenticeship programs and additional tax credits for companies that hire apprentices.

Sewell Statement on Trump Budget,"May 22, 2017","Washington, D.C. – Today, the President released a 2018 budget proposal with massive cuts to social safety-net programs, science, agricultural, and other institutions vital to Alabama communities. Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) releases the following statement:
“President Trump's budget takes aim at working families, rural Americans, the disabled, underserved communities, and those who struggle to make their voices heard in our democracy,” said Rep. Sewell. “Leaving those Americans behind is not only a failure in compassion, it is utterly short-sighted when it comes to growing our economy and making America competitive. In areas like healthcare, education, agriculture, and research, Trump's budget will have devastating consequences for Alabama. What makes our country great is our willingness to extend a hand up to those who need it most, and that's a value which Trump's budget cuts.”
Over the next decade, President Trump’s budget would slash more than $1.4 trillion from Medicaid, a health program covering nearly 70 million Americans. The budget also cuts $192 billion from nutritional assistance, and $72 billion from disability benefits, and would eliminate loan programs which subsidize college education for low-income families. Trump’s proposal would cut funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by more than $5 billion. Federally subsidized crop insurance would face a 36 percent cut, and President Trump’s budget proposes elimination of USDA’s rural economic development program and defunds the Delta Regional Authority and the Appalachian Regional Commission.

101,Economy,Rep. Sewell: Bipartisan Omnibus Bill is a Win for Alabama,"May 3, 2017","Washington, D.C. – Today, a bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives voted to pass legislation funding the federal government through the remainder of FY17. The deal includes an increase in funding for historic preservation, health research, student aid, and healthcare benefits for coal miners.
“This week’s bipartisan omnibus bill was a reminder of what we can accomplish when both parties work together,” said Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL). “The historic preservation funds included in the omnibus are going to have a real impact for Alabama, which is home to some of our nation’s most important civil rights sites as well as many of our historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). For students in my district, the omnibus includes investments in programs like Head Start, TRIO, and GEAR Up, and reinstates year-round Pell Grants, which is both a victory for Alabama students and the institutions where they learn. In addition, the bill bolsters our investment in the medical research conducted through NIH. For coal miners, the omnibus keeps our promise that, in exchange for their dangerous work, our government will protect our miners’ healthcare benefits. Taken as a whole, this legislation makes a strong investment in many of my district’s top priorities.”
The omnibus bill which passed on Wednesday includes $2 million in federal funding for the preservation of the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail, $13 million for the preservation of historic sites associated with the civil rights movement, and $4 million for historic preservation of HBCUs. Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell played an integral role in securing the designation of the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument and funding the preservation of other historic sites in Alabama including the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail.

Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell, a member of the Ways and Means Committee, responds with the following statement:
“The plan our President released today favors the wealthiest individuals and corporations with trillions in tax cuts, all while saddling working American families with the cost. I stand ready to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisles to reform our tax code in a way that benefits hardworking Americans and small businesses. But instead of offering reform, our President is recommending a plan that would save wealthy individuals like himself hundreds of millions of dollars. Trump’s refusal to disclose his tax returns means we may never know the full extent to which our President will profit off of his own tax plan.”
“For millions of working families, tax reform could mean the difference between gaining financial stability and just scraping by. This President and Republican leadership need to refocus their tax proposals on everyday Americans rather than the privileged few.”

103,Economy,Rep. Sewell Statement: Trump Budget Devastating for Alabama,"March 16, 2017","Washington, D.C. – Today, the President released a preliminary 2018 budget proposal with massive cuts to science, agricultural, and jobs programs, as well as other institutions central to Alabama’s economy. Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) releases the following statement:
“The budget that the President proposed today would be devastating to the economy and people of Alabama,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “Deep cuts to medical research are going to have a lasting impact on our state’s leading research institutions such as UAB and Southern Research Institute. The budget slashes funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, putting our state’s rural communities and farmers at risk. And when it comes to fighting poverty and helping struggling Alabamians, this budget leaves working families out in the cold. What the Trump Administration proposed today is not just short-sighted, it’s insulting to hard-working Americans who voted for someone who promised he would look out for their interests. I am a strong believer that our investments in infrastructure, science, and job growth can help our nation compete in today’s global marketplace, and I strongly oppose this budget’s cuts to some of our nation’s most powerful economic drivers.”
Many details are missing from the abbreviated budget released Thursday, including how many jobs would be eliminated across the federal government and the full cost of the President’s proposed border wall. The Trump Administration is expected to release its full budget in mid-May.
Proposed budget cuts impacting Alabama students, families, and workers include:

$6 billion in cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH funds 20 Alabama institutions, investing over $290 million dollars in Alabama.
$4.7 billion in cuts to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Since 2009, USDA has invested more than $3.8 billion to support affordable housing, create jobs, and promote economic opportunity for those who live, work, and raise their families in rural Alabama.
Major cuts to the Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), putting funding for many Alabama coastal projects at risk.
Elimination of funding for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG). CDBG has funded more than 4,000 projects across Alabama with the goal of supporting low-income families.

104,Economy,Rep. Sewell Issues Statement on Fairfield Walmart Closure,"January 20, 2016","Congresswoman Terri Sewell issued the following statement after speaking with Walmart executives about the pending closure of the Walmart Supercenter in Fairfield, Alabama:
“I am disappointed that Walmart has chosen to close its Supercenter in Fairfield, Alabama. That store was a vital part of Fairfield’s local economy, and approximately 300 employees will lose their jobs as a result. The closure also creates a food desert in Fairfield, an underserved area where residents have few viable alternatives to purchase quality and affordable food.
“Creating jobs continues to be my top priority. The economy has turned back from the brink and is growing, but the recovery is far too modest and more needs to be done to address persistent unemployment. Closing this Walmart store will be a step in the wrong direction. Despite remarkable economic gains I believe that our work is not done. Too many working men and women continue to struggle just to provide the basic necessities for their families.
“The closing of the Walmart Supercenter in Fairfield is simply wrong for my constituents. Too many communities of color find themselves underserved and disadvantaged and closing this store will not help the situation. If we are to truly and substantively address these inequities, we must ensure that economic prosperity is a dream attainable to all who are willing to work for it. Closing this Walmart is the wrong thing to do!
“I have expressed my concerns to senior Walmart executives. My hope is that Walmart will reconsider this decision after analyzing the negative effect this would have on the Western Birmingham communities. Walmart is one of our nation’s largest employers, and it is critically important that they consider the impact of their decisions on the communities they serve.”

I have reservations about several provisions in the bill, but ultimately I believe that the good contained in this bill outweighs the bad. My vote was cast in favor of keeping the government operating and to continue to make critical investments agency programs that benefit all Americans. I also firmly believe that we cannot afford another shutdown and this bill provides the Federal Government with funding through September 30, 2016.
“The omnibus provides much needed increases for a broad range of education programs including Head Start, Title I grants, aid to HBCUs, the TRIO and GEAR UP programs, and rural education. Providing the resources low-income families need to increase their academic success is one of my highest priorities, and this legislation is a first step in the right direction. 
“Furthermore, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and other minority serving institutions are set to receive an additional $40 million in funding. HBCUs have created and fostered a generation of African-American professionals, and still play a vital role in educating our youth. My district is home to some of the most prominent HBCUs in the Country, and as a Vice Chair of the Bipartisan Congressional HBCU Caucus, securing adequate funding for these institutions is critically important to me.
“I am also pleased that this bill provides funding through the Department of the Interior that will be used to preserve historic civil sites. The struggle for civil and voting rights is an integral part of American history. Our district is known as the civil rights district, and we have the potential to benefit from this competitive grant process. I fought to secure two amendments that made this funding possible in order to preserve important civil rights sites for future generations.
“The bill includes many increases in programs that are critical to improving access to quality health care and innovative medical research. I am particularly pleased to see a much needed increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). These investments in research are essential to providing long-term stability for our research communities in Birmingham and across the state. The package recognizes that HIV and Hepatitis should be a priority by reinvesting in the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As the mental health crisis becomes more urgent, the deal’s increased funding for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency (SAMHSA) is a welcome sign of progress for the mental health community.
“There is an urgent need to address racial health disparities in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District, and I am pleased this bill recognizes that need. By funding Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH), Congress has made an investment to help eliminate health disparities across a range of diseases, including: heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. 
“This is not a perfect bill, but I am proud that both sides of the aisle were able to work out a compromise that benefits our nation, and helps us continue to grow.”

106,Economy,Rep. Sewell Votes Against the So-Called Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015,"December 17, 2015","Congresswoman Terri Sewell voted against the so-called Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015, saying the massive tax bill would increase the federal deficit by $622 billion over the next 10 years.
“While I support a strong tax policy that provides certainty to individuals and American businesses, the permanency of many of these provisions without any offsets to fund their costs is of deep concern. This legislation includes several provisions that I strongly support like the earned income tax credit, the child tax credit, and the American opportunity tax credit. The package also provides a two-year moratorium on the medical device tax and extends the work opportunity tax credit to help employers that hire Americans who have faced significant barriers to employment.
However, I am deeply concerned that passing this tax extenders package without offsetting its cost would greatly undermine our ability to make key discretionary investments in the future, hurt job creation, and lessen opportunities that make the American dream possible for millions of families across our great nation.  The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that the overall provisions contained within this bill would reduce net revenues, and increase deficits by a total of $622 billion over 10 years. We know that every dollar in lost revenue must be made up somewhere else in the budget. Far too often my Republican colleagues have sought to do this by reducing spending in critically important domestic spending programs such as infrastructure, education, social security, and healthcare.
“I carefully weighed this tax extenders package against its long-term impact on Congress’ ability to help businesses create jobs and opportunities, invest in our aging infrastructure, and strengthen our national security. In the end, this bill came up short.
“The American people deserve a more balanced bill that offsets its cost, and helps both individuals and businesses equitably across the board. Unfortunately this bill was not able to meet that objective.”","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
107,Economy,Rep. Sewell Votes in Favor of Budget Deal that Averts a Potential Government Shutdown,"October 28, 2015","Congresswoman Terri Sewell issued the following statement after voting in support of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015:
“Congress cannot continue to govern crisis-by-crisis. Few in Congress want to repeat the costly 2013 government shutdown, and thankfully today’s vote reflected that.
“I still have strong concerns about the proposed changes to the critically important crop insurance program that helps support farmers and ranchers in the 7th Congressional District, and across the country. However, I will take House leadership at their word as they have assured me that we will continue to work together to resolve this issue for our farming community.
“While this bill is not a perfect one, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 breaks the sequester stronghold that has stifled our domestic and defense spending priorities. Alabama was hit hard when the sequester was implemented, and this bill loosens the arbitrary spending caps that hampered critical investments in domestic programs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the direct effect of the budget agreement will create 340,000 additional new jobs in 2016, and a total of 500,000 jobs by 2017. These jobs are critically important to hardworking Americans who continue to struggle to make ends meet and provide for their families.  The Bipartisan Budget Act ultimately creates economic certainty, affirms the full faith and credit of the United States, and ensures that our brave men and women in uniform have the resources they need to meet ongoing and emerging threats around the world.
“I am also proud that this bill will block a 20 percent cut in Social Security disability benefits, and prevent a 52 percent spike in Medicare Part B premiums. If Congress refused to act, premiums for Alabama’s Medicare population would have jumped 52 percent on January 1, 2016. Our nation made a promise to seniors that we would assist them with medical costs as they aged. We cannot take back that promise.
 “Both sides of the aisle have made compromises in order to reach this point. I called on Congress earlier this month to enact a comprehensive, long-term budget bill that appropriately funds all necessary government services and obligations. I am pleased that Congress met this challenge.”

108,Economy,Rep. Sewell Votes to Give President Obama Authority to Negotiate Fair Trade Deals,"June 17, 2015","Today, Congresswoman Terri Sewell reiterated her support for President Obama’s trade agenda, and voted for a second time to give President Obama the authority he needs to negotiate agreements that expand fair trade.
“I continue to believe that President Obama should be given the same trade promotion authority as past Presidents. I trust that President Obama will do right by the American people, and the people of Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. President Obama has our backs, and we should have his.
“President Obama has been unwavering in his support for promoting fair trade that protects American jobs and workers. I trust that President Obama will continue to protect the interests of the nation he has been elected to serve, and to uphold the values we hold dear.
“I am deeply disappointed that Congress has yet to reauthorize the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA). TAA is a vital lifeline for displaced workers that provides the needed resources for training, employment services, and relocation allowances. Globalization and automation -- irrespective of trade agreements -- have created a need for greater support services for workers who lost their jobs through no fault of their own.  It is my hope that my colleagues will reconsider the TAA vote because I strongly believe that TPA and TAA go hand in hand.”

109,Economy,Rep. Sewell Urges House Leaders to Adopt Stronger Trade Enforcement Provisions,"June 8, 2015","Congresswoman Terri Sewell urged House Leadership to adopt stronger trade enforcement laws to protect the American steel industry as a part of the trade legislation lawmakers are expected to vote on this week. 
“My vote on trade legislation hinges on stronger trade enforcement provisions on anti-dumping and currency manipulation, which directly affect the steel industry in my district. Any trade legislation that comes before the House must contain provisions that protect American workers and industries against unfair competition and deceptive trading practices. At the very least, the House should adopt measures to timely consider anti-dumping and countervailing claims before the International Trade Commission (ITC), and provide the Department of Commerce with the flexibility to use prices that are not distorted when calculating dumping,” said Rep. Sewell.
“The steel industry supports an estimated 63,000 jobs across Alabama, and is one of the largest employers in the 7th Congressional District of Alabama. We cannot afford to lose even one job because other countries are not playing by the rules.
“One-sided trade practices like dumping and currency manipulation are hurting American businesses, particularly our steel industry, and the U.S. trade remedy laws only correct the problem after the fact. By the time that the process has been completed, American workers have already been laid off and our businesses have already lost their market share.
“American industries should not be forced to compete on an uneven playing field. Unfair trade practices hurt our domestic economy and our competitiveness abroad.”

110,Economy,Rep. Sewell to Unveil Stronger Consumer Borrower Protections,"April 15, 2015","Washington, D.C. -- Congresswoman Terri Sewell will soon introduce legislation to better protect consumers as a follow-up to President Obama’s March visit to Birmingham where he outlined the stronger need for payday lending requirements.
Today, Congresswoman Sewell outlined the urgent need for reform on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. A video of her speech is available online at https://sewell.house.gov/media-center/videos. Below is the text of her floor speech:
Thank you Mr./Madam Speaker,
Today I rise to talk about the critical need for stronger oversight of payday lenders.
In March, I welcomed President Obama to the City of Birmingham in my district, where he highlighted our nation’s economic recovery and put a spotlight on the area that needed most improvement. The President highlighted the urgent need for better regulation of the payday lending industry the very same day that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau unveiled proposals to rein in this loosely-regulated industry.
I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the CFPB’s efforts to ensure that these products help -- not harm -- consumers. The payday lending and title loan industry must take steps to ensure that borrowers understand the loan terms and have the resources to pay them back. 
In my district, the proliferation of payday lending is really unacceptable. On every corner, you will find a payday lender. In fact the President quoted that there were more payday lending institutions in my district than there were McDonald’s.
These borrowers are disproportionately African American or Latino – two communities that were severely impacted by the predatory lending practices – and far too many of these borrowers find themselves trapped in a cycle of debt.
In the coming weeks, I plan to introduce a bill and to spearhead efforts led by consumer industry groups to protect consumers from predatory lending. I ask my colleagues to join me. These good people are my constituents, and not this industry’s prey.

111,Economy,Rep. Sewell to Travel to Birmingham with President Obama,"March 26, 2015","Washington, D.C. -- Congresswoman Terri Sewell issued the following statement ahead of President Obama’s trip to the City of Birmingham, Alabama, where she will join him as he discusses efforts his Administration has made to create a safer financial system that protects American families and creates a strong economy. The President is expected to discuss the economy, payday lending and the success of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):
“President Obama is a staunch advocate for a strong financial system that provides greater transparency and accountability for all Americans. Under his administration the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has helped consumers recover more than $5.3 billion by ending unfair and abusive practices. 
“I hosted CFPB Director Richard Cordray in Birmingham for their first Field Hearing on Payday Lending. While I understand there is a real need for emergency credit, I strongly believe consumer protections are needed to regulate this industry.
“The President’s visit to the City brings the national spotlight to the State of Alabama, a state with one of the highest concentrations of payday lenders. Thus, it is fitting that President Obama will travel to Birmingham to speak about the progress we have made to build a safer and stronger financial system that protects families from the abuses which led the economy to near collapse—and his commitment to safeguarding that progress. 
“America has a lot of work to do to improve our economy.  The City of Birmingham and the State of Alabama have the tools and the leadership needed to create solid job growth and make the economic recovery a reality for those struggling families who have yet to feel its full effects.
“As a member of the House Financial Services Committee, I will continue to work with my colleagues to promote better financial practices that protect consumers, strengthen our economy and stimulate economic growth.
“I welcome President Obama to Birmingham for his second visit to Alabama this month. His selection of Lawson State Community College, in the heart of my district, acknowledges the vital role two-year colleges play in preparing our youth for 21st century jobs and giving them the necessary tools to make better financial decisions for themselves and their families.”

“I am deeply disappointed by U.S. Steel’s recent announcement that they will lay off workers at their Fairfield, Alabama facilities. I am concerned about the workers and families who depend on these critically important jobs to make ends meet. While my hope is that this reduction will only be temporary, it is imperative that we work together to minimize the impact of these potential layoffs on the lives of these hardworking men and women.
“U.S. Steel is an integral part of our local and regional economy, and I am proud to stand with members of the United Steelworkers. Congress must do more to help companies like U.S. Steel and others in the manufacturing sector grow and create more jobs for Americans.”

113,Economy,Congresswoman Sewell Supports Keystone XL,"January 9, 2015","Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Terri Sewell (AL-7) voted today to approve the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline.
“After much deliberation, I voted in favor of constructing the Keystone XL Pipeline to strengthen our economy and create more jobs in Alabama and across this nation.
“Keystone XL will create thousands of construction jobs for welders, pipefitters, and electricians during the pipeline’s construction and after its completion. As our economy continues to recover, I am confident that the hardworking men and women in Alabama’s 7thCongressional District and their families will enthusiastically welcome these skilled and well-paying construction and manufacturing jobs.
“My vote for Keystone does not, in any way, undermine my commitment to protecting our environment, but rather affirms my belief that a responsible, all of the above energy strategy is the best approach to achieving true energy independence while spurring critical job creation. I will continue my support for strategic investments in renewable and green energy, as well promote increased oil production right here in North America.
“I am proud to stand with numerous groups, nationally and in Alabama, that support the Keystone XL Pipeline, including: U.S. Steel – Fairfield Works and Fairfield Tubular Operations, Vulcan Materials Company, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the North America Building Trades Unions, the National Electrical Contractors Association, and the American Road and Transportation Builders Association.”

114,Economy,Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell Statement in Support of Omnibus Funding Bill,"January 14, 2014","Washington, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell released the following statement regarding the omnibus funding legislation:
“Today, I voted in favor of the bipartisan funding bill for 2014.  Congress has finally taken a step in the right direction by funding the federal government in a responsible manner and ending the drastic cuts imposed by sequestration.  This legislation keeps the government open, eliminates the uncertainty caused by partisan brinkmanship and ensures that important services are provided to the American people.
In particular,  I am pleased that this bill issues a reprieve for those facing flood insurance premium increases, addresses sexual assault in the Department of Defense, repeals last year’s cuts to veteran’s benefits, restores full funding for Head Start and boosts funding for Early Head Start.   However, the bill falls short of fully funding programs critically important to the people of Alabama, like the Community Development Block Grant Program. Likewise, the legislation does not extend the emergency unemployment insurance program that is relied upon by 13,482 Alabamians.    
While the omnibus agreement does not adequately fund many critically important programs, it is a welcomed departure from the harmful sequestration cuts that have undermined our National Security, harmed American families and weakened our fragile economic recovery.

I share the frustrations of millions of Americans who are fed up with the political brinkmanship in the halls of Congress. For the last sixteen (16) days, House Republicans have placed partisan politics ahead of the needs of the American people by allowing the government shutdown to continue due to their unreasonable demands to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.  We do not put America’s full faith and credit in jeopardy to score political points. 
While I agree Congress must address our debt crisis, it is reckless and woefully irresponsible to do so at the expense of the American economy. There are no winners in this debacle. We all lose when 800,000 federal workers are furloughed, costing American taxpayers $300 million a day and diminishing our economic reputation globally. Enough is enough! Let’s reopen government and prevent an economic default so we can finally come to the table and deal with the pressing issues of deficit reduction and job creation.”

“Once again House Republicans put partisan politics ahead of the needs of the American people.  The government shutdown is the sole creation of the House Republicans. The GOP had a chance to avert the government shutdown but chose political brinkmanship over responsible compromise. In order to avoid the shutdown, the Senate sent the House a compromise spending bill that accepted the GOP’s lower funding levels. Instead of allowing a vote on this clean Continuing Resolution, House Republicans once again attached unreasonable amendments which had no hope of gaining bi-partisan support. Enough is enough! We cannot continue playing ping pong with the well-being of the American people.
A government shutdown will have a devastating impact on my constituents in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District and citizens across the nation, depriving millions of Americans of vital services and costing American taxpayers an estimated $150 million a day. Families on food stamps and kids who benefit from the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) programs will go hungry. Over 17,000 children in Alabama will be affected by immediate cuts to the Head Start Program. Many government offices across this country will close and the more than 43,000 federal workers in Alabama could be affected. Our national economy should not be held hostage to partisan games.
Our constituents sent us to Congress, not to create problems but to find solutions. Let’s start earning the title of “Representative” by doing what is in the best interest of the American people we represent.”

117,Education,Rep. Sewell Announces $16.9 Million in EPA Rebates for Clean School Buses in Alabama,"May 29, 2024","Montgomery, AL —Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced $16,910,000 from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in rebate funding for clean school buses in Alabama. The rebates will help schools purchase over 51 clean school buses in 10 school districts across the state. EPA’s Clean School Bus program was created by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and will help Alabama accelerate the transition to zero emission vehicles and to replace older, diesel fueled school buses, which have been linked to asthma and other conditions that harm the health of students and surrounding communities. 
Rep. Sewell was the only member of Alabama’s Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. 
“President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is once again delivering for Alabama!” said Rep. Sewell. “Not only will this funding reduce pollution and make our communities healthier, but it will also save our school districts money and free up resources to invest in the success of our students. I was so proud to help make this program possible and I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration for this investment into Alabama’s schools."" 
School districts selected for rebates in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District include:

Selma City has been selected to receive $1,725,000 in rebate funding to purchase five clean school buses for the Lion Electric Co USA Inc. 
Montgomery County has been selected to receive $690,000 in rebate funding to purchase two clean school buses for the Lion Electric Co USA Inc. 

Other Alabama selectees include:

The Alabama Aerospace and Aviation has been selected to receive $400,000 in rebate funding to purchase two clean school buses for the Student Transportation of America, Inc. 
Clay County has been selected to receive $1,035,000 in rebate funding to purchase three clean school buses for the Transportation South, Inc. 
Fort Payne City has been selected to receive $1,380,000 in rebate funding to purchase four clean school buses for the Transportation South, Inc. 
Gulf Shores City has been selected to receive $600,000 in rebate funding to purchase three clean school buses for the Navistar Inc. 
Huntsville City has been selected to receive $ 8,625,000 in rebate funding to purchase 25 clean school buses for the First Student, Inc. 
Jasper City has been selected to receive $690,000 in rebate funding to purchase two clean school buses for the Transportation South, Inc. 
Lanett City has been selected to receive $1,725,000 in rebate funding to purchase five clean school buses for the Lion Electric Co USA Inc. 

The EPA Clean School Bus Program was created by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which provides an unprecedented $5 billion of funding to transform the nation’s fleet of school buses. The Clean School Bus Program funds electric buses, which produce zero tailpipe emissions, as well as propane and compressed natural gas (CNG) buses, which produce lower tailpipe emissions compared to their older diesel predecessors.
The Clean School Bus Program will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save money for school districts, and produce cleaner air. Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other conditions that harm students’ health and cause them to miss school, particularly in communities of color and Tribal communities. Phasing out these diesel engines will ensure cleaner air for students, bus drivers, and school staff working near the bus loading areas, and the communities through which the buses drive each day.
The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from these bus replacements will also help to address the outsized role of the transportation sector in fueling the climate crisis. The program will save school districts money as they upgrade school bus fleets, replacing existing buses with brand new zero-emission and clean school buses, while freeing up needed resources for schools.

Among the institutions receiving funding are Trenholm State Community College, Stillman College, Alabama State University, Talladega College, Tuskegee University, University of West Alabama, and Drake State Community and Technical College.
“The COVID-19 pandemic put a spotlight on the dire need to expand access to reliable high-speed internet in Alabama,” said Rep. Sewell. “That’s why in 2020, I led a letter to Congressional Leadership urging additional funding to expand broadband in the COVID-19 emergency funding package. I’m proud that as a result of this advocacy, six Alabama HBCUs and minority serving institutions will be receiving over $18 million to increase access to high-speed internet for their students and faculty. This will make a big difference for each of these cherished campuses and I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration for this critical investment.”
In May 2020, Rep. Sewell led her colleagues in a letter to House and Senate leadership successfully urging the inclusion of increased funding for broadband expansion in the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thanks to her advocacy, the bill directed $268 million for expanding high-speed Internet access and connectivity to eligible HBCUs, Tribal Colleges or Universities (TCUs), and other MSIs which made this funding announcement possible.

124,Education,"Rep. Sewell Announces Millions in Workforce Development Funding for Birmingham, Bessemer","September 26, 2022","Department of Labor YouthBuild grants which Sewell helped secure will provide job training and educational opportunities for at-risk youth







Birmingham, AL – Today, during press conferences in Birmingham and Bessemer, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced millions in grant funding from the United States Department of Labor (DOL) for job training and educational opportunities for at-risk youth. The Bessemer Housing Authority and Housing Authority of the Birmingham District (HABD) will each receive 1.5 million from the DOL’s YouthBuild program to support the development of apprenticeship and other career pathway models that prepare at-risk youth for jobs in construction and other in-demand industries, especially clean energy. The awards are part of a $90 million investment by the Biden-Harris Administration to grow America’s clean energy workforce with education and training for young adults.
“This announcement is truly a win-win for our community,” celebrated Rep. Sewell. “By connecting at-risk youth with job training and education, this funding will provide our most vulnerable young adults with the resources they need to succeed, all while growing our green energy workforce. Once again, I applaud the Biden-Harris Administration for making transformational investments in our community!” 
“We are delighted to be awarded the Department of Labor YouthBuild Grant to help provide the youth of Bessemer, Alabama with additional resources, furthering their education and preparing them to become productive citizens in our community,” said Courtney Coleman, Executive Director of the Bessemer Housing Authority.“We believe these funds along with our community partners will work together to ‘Build Better Lives’ and ‘Deliver Hope’, which is the mission here at the Bessemer Housing Authority.”
“This is a monumental win for our agency,” said HABD Board Chairman Dr. Anthony Hood. “This award allows us to equip our most promising youth with the tools needed to thrive in an ever-competitive workforce. The demand for skilled trades and apprenticeships has never been stronger, and this grant allows us to place our young people on a direct path to the careers of the future.”
“Often, when a child drops out of school, society takes it as a sign that they have given up hope that life can get any better for them. This grant allows us to seek out those youth and give that hope back to them,” said HABD President and CEO Dontrelle Young Foster.“With this award, HABD can prepare residents for quality jobs and promote the attainment of skills necessary for success in this knowledge-based economy. This is a win not only for the clients we serve at HABD but also for the entire City of Birmingham.”
Following its Nov. 23, 2021 announcement of available funding, DOL awarded 68 grants—ranging from $700,000 to $1.5 million—to organizations in 28 states and Puerto Rico to deliver job training and employment services. Participants will engage in classroom learning that will prepare them for work-based learning opportunities building and rehabilitating affordable housing for low-income or homeless families in their communities.
Participants will split their time between workplace training and the classroom, where they will earn a high school diploma or equivalent degree to prepare for postsecondary opportunities.
Administered by the department's Employment and Training Administration, the latest YouthBuild grants complement the Biden-Harris administration's workforce priorities to advance equitable career pathway opportunities, quality jobs and climate sustainability by supporting programs that provide construction skills focused on green building techniques, including understanding sustainable building materials, solar panel installation, weatherization processes and the use of Energy Star appliances. These announcements will also further President Biden's Justice40 Initiative that commits to delivering at least 40 percent of the benefits from federal climate and clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities.
For the first time, the YouthBuild funding opportunity announcement included criteria that awarded bonus points for applicants that demonstrated their ability to provide training in green construction techniques, training the next generation of workers for resilience and clean energy careers of the future.
YouthBuild programs also train young people for employment in healthcare, information technology, manufacturing and logistics, culinary arts, and hospitality.

Sewell Announces $2.7 Million in American Rescue Plan Funding for Stillman College to Boost Cybersecurity and IT Workforce Development Efforts,"September 20, 2022","Tuscaloosa, AL – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) is awarding a $2.7 million grant to Stillman College in Tuscaloosa to support development of a cybersecurity and information technology training center. The center will work to meet local employers’ existing and future workforce needs and is expected to create 100 jobs, retain 100 jobs, and generate $1 million in private investment. This EDA grant will be matched with $100,000 in state funds. Funding for this grant was made available by the American Rescue Plan, which Rep. Sewell was the only member of the Alabama Congressional Delegation to support.
“As the only member of the Alabama Delegation to support the American Rescue Plan, I am so proud that the Economic Development Administration is awarding this funding to the historic Stillman College in Tuscaloosa,” said Rep. Sewell. “This transformative grant will help create 100 jobs in West Alabama, equip our students with critical skills, and position our community for future economic growth. I thank President Biden and Secretary Raimondo for supporting community-led economic development and fighting to ensure that our next generation of students can pursue careers in the 21st century economy.”
This project was made possible by the regional planning efforts led by the West Alabama Regional Commission (WARC). EDA funds WARC to bring together the public and private sectors to create an economic development roadmap to strengthen the regional economy, support private capital investment and create jobs.
This project is funded under EDA’s American Rescue Plan Economic Adjustment Assistance Program, which makes $500 million in Economic Adjustment Assistance grants available to American communities. The Economic Adjustment Assistance program is EDA’s most flexible program, and grants made under this program will help hundreds of communities across the nation plan, build, innovate, and put people back to work through construction or non-construction projects designed to meet local needs. Effective May 26, 2022, EDA has officially closed all of its American Rescue Plan programs for applications. The $3 billion program funding will be awarded on a rolling basis through September 30, 2022.

The bill passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 220-213 and will now make its way to the U.S. Senate.
“Within six weeks of President Biden taking office, we passed the American Rescue Plan to save our economy, crush the pandemic, and deliver critical relief to Americans everywhere,” said Rep. Sewell. “Just last week, we delivered the largest investment in our nation’s infrastructure in nearly a century. Now, with the passage of President Biden’s historic Build Back Better Act, House Democrats are delivering on our promise to build an economy that puts working families first!”
“For far too long, those at the very top have seen their fortunes grow while hard-working Americans have been squeezed,” continued Sewell. “Not anymore—I’m proud to report that the Build Back Better Act will uplift Alabama’s most underserved communities with transformational progress! The bill will provide affordable health insurance to Alabamians caught in the coverage gap, lower prescription drug costs, create universal pre-K, extend the Child Tax Credit, address the climate crisis and environmental injustice with bold action, and so much more. Together, President Biden and Congressional Democrats will continue to deliver historic progress for the American people!”
The Build Back Better Act:
Creates Millions of Good-Paying Jobs - Together with the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Build Back Better Act will create an average of 2 million jobs per year over the course of the next decade.
Cuts Taxes for Families and Workers - Prior to the pandemic, 16% of children under the age of 18 in Alabama lived in poverty. The Build Back Better Act will bolster financial security and spur economic growth in Alabama by reducing taxes on the middle class and those striving to break into it. The bill will extend Child Tax Credit (CTC) increases of $300/month per child under 6 or $250/month per child ages 6 to 17. This will continue the largest one-year reduction in child poverty in history. Critically, the agreement includes permanent refundability for the Child Tax Credit, meaning that the neediest families will continue to receive the full Child Tax Credit over the long-run. The bill will also provide a tax cut of up to $1,500 for 274,300 low-wage workers in Alabama by extending the American Rescue Plan’s Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) expansion.
Closes the Medicaid Coverage Gap and Provides the Largest Expansion of Affordable Health Care in a Decade - Because states like Alabama refuse to expand Medicaid, about 4 million Americans and nearly 300,000 Alabamians lack health insurance. The Build Back Better Act will close the Medicaid coverage gap by extending through 2025 the enhanced premium subsidies in the ACA Marketplace that were included in the American Rescue Plan. In doing so, it will ensure that every Alabamian and every American in the Medicaid coverage gap has access to affordable health insurance.
Expands Medicare with Hearing Coverage for Seniors - Beginning January 1, 2023, the bill allows for qualified audiologists to deliver aural rehabilitation and treatment services under Medicare, in addition to the hearing and balance assessment services provided under current law. It also allows for qualified hearing aid professionals to deliver hearing assessment services under Medicare. The bill also provides for coverage of hearing aids under Medicare Part B forindividuals with moderately severe, severe or profound loss in one or both ears.
Lowers Prescription Drug Costs - The Build Back Better Act allows the Secretary of HHS to negotiate certain drug prices and halts price hikes above inflation for all Americans. It ensures that Americans with diabetes don’t pay more than $35 per month for their insulin. It also creates a new, out-of-pocket cap of $2,000 on what seniors pay for their drugs in Medicare Part D.
Lowers Child Care Costs - Working families across Alabama are facing a child care crisis. The high cost of child care is straining family budgets and pushing millions of Alabamians out of the workforce – a majority of whom are women. The lack of affordable child care is also hurting our economy. As workers are forced to stay home, employers are struggling to fill job openings to meet demand and grow their businesses. The Build Back Better Act will dramatically lower the cost of child care for many families. Under the bill, the vast majority of families would not pay more than seven percent of their income on child care, representing an enormous savings from what they pay now. The bill invests a total $390 billion for the child care initiative and the universal preschool initiative. Under the bill, child care providers would also have resources to raise wages for child care workers and expand available supply to serve more children and families.
Establishes Paid Family and Medical Leave - The United States lags behind the rest of the industrialized world when it comes to guaranteeing paid family and medical leave. Only 21 percent of American workers have access to employer-provided paid family leave, and just 42 percent of American workers have access to paid medical leave through an employer-provided plan. The Build Back Better Act establishes a universal and permanent family and medical leave program. The program provides four weeks of paid parental, family caregiving, and medical leave.
Provides Universal, High-Quality, Free Pre-K for Every 3- and 4-year old in America - Today, only 23% of 3- and 4-year-olds in Alabama have access to publicly funded preschool, and it costs about $8,600 per year for those who can’t access a publicly-funded program. The Build Back Better Act will enable Alabama to expand access to free, high-quality preschool to more than about 105,000 additional 3- and 4-year-olds per year and increase the quality of preschool for children who are already enrolled. Parents will be able to send their children to the preschool setting of their choice—from public schools to child care providers to Head Start—leading to lifelong educational benefits, allowing more parents to go back to work, and building a stronger foundation for Alabama’s future economic competitiveness.
Invests in HBCUs, TCUs and MSIs - The Build Back Better Act invests $3 billion in a competitive grant program to improve the research capacity and research and development infrastructure at four-year Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). The competitive grant program will consist of planning grants for a period of one to two years and implementation grants for a period of one to five years. The bill also invests $6 billion in institutional aid grants to HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, which can be used by these institutions to strengthen their academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities and award need-based financial aid to low-income students.
Reduces Housing Costs and Expands Housing Options - 260,000 renters in Alabama are rent burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent, while homeownership remains out of reach for many families. The Build Back Better Act will expand rental assistance for Alabama renters, while also increasing the supply of high-quality housing through the construction and rehabilitation of over 1 million affordable housing units nationwide. It will address the capital needs of the entire public housing stock in America and it includes one of the largest investments in down payment assistance in history, enabling more first-generation homebuyers to purchase their first home.
Makes the Largest Effort to Combat Climate Change in American History - From 2010 to 2020, Alabama experienced 38 extreme weather events, costing up to $20 billion in damages. The Build Back Better Act is the largest effort to combat climate change in American history, investing $555 billion over 10 years in clean energy and climate investments. It contains green tax credits which will save the average American family hundreds of dollars per year in energy costs. It also Ensures clean energy technology – from wind turbine blades to solar panels to electric cars – will be built in the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of good jobs here at home.

All services are free. 
“As the Principal Investigator for this grant, I’m so excited that UAB gets to be a community partner to assist our adult learners,” said Dr. Tracy Lyons, Executive Director of Undergraduate Student Success and Retention at UAB. “This program is ideal for individuals who may have dropped out of school or those seeking new and different skills that come with a college certificate or degree.”","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means

136,Education,Rep. Sewell Secures Over $7.8 Million for Community Projects in Alabama’s 7th District in House’s FY2022 Government Funding Bills,"July 30, 2021","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced that she secured the inclusion of over $7.8 million for eight community projects in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District in House Democrats’ FY2022 government funding bills. With the passage of these bills in the House of Representatives this week, funding for these community projects has cleared a key hurdle. The bills must now face negotiations in the Senate.
“I fought hard to secure funding for community projects in Alabama’s 7th District in the 2022 government funding bills, and I am beyond thrilled to announce that over $7.8 million was included for projects in our district,” said Rep. Sewell. “By including funding for these projects, House Democrats are bypassing bureaucracy and getting money directly into the community where it’s needed. I am hopeful that the Senate will swiftly approve this funding and I look forward to seeing President Biden sign it into law.”
In April, Rep. Sewell submitted requests to the House Appropriations Committee to fund community projects in Alabama’s 7th District. Funding for eight of these projects, totaling $7,829,355, was included in House Democrats’ appropriations package that passed in the House this week. The bills will now make their way to the Senate where they will face additional negotiations before being passed and signed into law by President Biden. Rep. Sewell looks forward to her other community project funding requests being included in Appropriations bills still pending before the House of Representatives.
Rep. Sewell secured funding, totaling $7,829,355.00, for the following community projects in the House’s government funding bills:
*NOTE: Funding for these projects must still be passed by the Senate.

Jefferson County - Greater Shiloh Baptist Church - Employment and Training Project

Recipient: Cornerstone Revitalization Foundation, Inc.
Award: $1,500,000.00
Project: To reduce recidivism, CWD will afford adults ages 25 and older opportunities to learn trade and technical skills. Participants will also have the opportunity to get their GED and pursue post-secondary education opportunities and help with obtaining affordable housing. The program is about assisting participants with not just jobs but careers. 


Jefferson County - North Birmingham Community Development Rehabilitation Project

Recipient: City of Birmingham
Award: $3,000,000.00
Project: The North Birmingham Community has suffered from environmental justice concerns for over a century. A largely redlined area, the community includes multiple coal refinement operations, the 35th Avenue Superfund site, and parts of the community sustain flood damage regularly. This project would remove environmental concerns in the old North Birmingham Elementary School. The redevelopment of the North Birmingham site would provide a transformative redevelopment investment in North Birmingham.


Jefferson County - Small Business Accelerator Program

Recipient: Central Alabama Redevelopment Alliance
Award: $474,355.00
Project: The Small Business Accelerator provides micro companies and small businesses access to instructional workshops, key resource providers, and other support to help them expand and create jobs for the local community. The Accelerator helps Alabama small businesses establish core systems and processes that would allow their business to survive a natural disaster, economic downturn, or other business interruptions.


Lowndes County - Wastewater Disposal Treatment System Project

Recipient: Lowndes County Unincorporated Wastewater Program
Award: $700,000.00
Project: Failing septic tanks and deteriorating wastewater infrastructure in Lowndes County have left many families with untreated sewage in their yards and in local waterways. This is not only an infrastructure crisis, but a healthcare crisis. This funding would facilitate the installation of septic tanks for homes in unincorporated areas without proper wastewater disposal systems. 


Perry County – Drinking Water Infrastructure Project

Recipient: City of Marion
Award: $480,000.00
Project: The improvement of the City of Marion’s water infrastructure is critical to the health and economic vitality of the community. Failures of the water system after recent natural disasters have threatened the continued operation of local institutions like Marion Military Institute and Judson College. These funds will help provide functional water systems to a community that is combating intergenerational poverty in the Black Belt.


Sumter County - Hill Hospital Construction Project

Recipient: Hill Hospital
Award: $575,000.00
Project: For several years, Hill Hospital has faced persistent challenges to provide comprehensive health care to the citizens in Sumter County. Geographic isolation, economic fluctuations, and the COVID 19 pandemic have magnified these challenges. This funding will improve the facilities and patient rooms at Hill Hospital so they can continue to serve the county and provide healthcare to the rural community. The long-term viability of Hill Hospital will prevent residents from traveling to other counties and states to seek health care.


Tuscaloosa County - Community Health Worker Initiative

Recipient: West Central Alabama Area Health Education Center
Award: $300,000.00
Project: The Community Health Worker Initiative will develop and implement a training program throughout Alabama to improve access to healthcare, increase community resilience, and promote health education in rural areas. Nearly half of Alabama’s state population lives in a rural county, and on average, those individuals are more likely to be low-income, uninsured, and suffer from higher rates of chronic health conditions. This program will help aid these communities while also addressing the primary care, dental, and mental health workforce shortage in Alabama.


Tuscaloosa County - TRAMS CORE Improvement of Postsecondary Education

Recipient: Stillman College
Award: $800,000.00
Project: The Translational and Mechanistic Science for Collaborative Organic Research Environment (TRAMS CORE) program addresses traditional roadblocks for research and will provide a platform to generate new research efforts on the campus of a HBCU. Subsequently, the successful integration of shared resources will support continued growth in biomedical research in the community. This proposal is part of a long-term commitment toward the development and sustainability of biomedical research facilities at Stillman College.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means

138,Education,Rep. Sewell Announces over $7 Million in Funding for Local Head Start Programs,"June 30, 2021","Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) announced over $7 million in federal funding for Head Start programs serving Alabama’s 7th Congressional District. This funding will allow Head Start programs to continue preparing Alabama children for success and will grow our economy by helping caregivers get back to work knowing their children are safe and cared for.
“Our children are our future and our greatest asset,” said Rep. Sewell. “Tragically, the COVID-19 pandemic deprived too many Alabama children of a safe, supportive learning environment, causing them to fall behind in their educational journeys.”
“The best way to put our country on a path to prosperity is by investing in the next generation of change-makers,” continued Sewell. “I’m so proud to announce that Head Start programs serving children in Alabama’s 7th District will receive over $7 million from the American Rescue Plan. This funding will help us bounce back from the devastation of the past year by getting parents back to work and providing our children the tools they need to grow and thrive.”
Funding, which totals $7,170,627 was awarded to the following Head Start programs serving Alabama’s 7th Congressional District.
Head Start programs serving only Alabama’s 7th District:

Pickens County Community Action Committee and Community Development Corporation, Inc. - $271,606
Sumter County Opportunity, Inc. -  $579,106
Lowndes Co. School District - $233,318
The Black Belt Community Foundation - $367,326
Berean Head Start - $143,580

Head Start programs serving multiple congressional districts including Alabama’s 7th:

Alabama Dept. of Human Resources - $677,219

The University of Alabama at Birmingham - $105,292

This comes in addition to the $732 million in funding that Rep. Sewell helped secure through the American Rescue Plan (previously announced) to keep Alabama’s child care providers on the job and keep costs down for working families.
The American Rescue Plan also includes a historic increase in support for child care through the tax code, helping millions of working families afford needed care. Rep. Sewell played a critical role in drafting the expansions of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan, which are projected to cut child poverty in the United States in half. More information on the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit can be found here.
How local Head Start programs are using funding from the American Rescue Plan
“The 2020 school year was very challenging,” said Cynthia Simpson, Executive Director of Pickens County Community Action. “We, like many other schools, elected to offer virtual learning to protect our staff and most importantly, our little people. We understand the burden this may have caused and the educational setback, so we are proud to offer the Pickens County Summer Learning Program for our students. The American Rescue Plans has provided the opportunity to offer summer learning to ensure our 4-year-olds are prepared for the transition to kindergarten. We were also able to purchase PPE and an additional bus to provide necessary space for support staff and students during transport to and from school.”
“The Blackbelt Community Foundation has been overwhelmed with requests for support from our communities,” said Felicia Lucky, President of the Blackbelt Community Foundation. “Funds made possible by the American Rescue Plan have allowed us to bridge the digital divide that was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We were able to purchase laptops to keep our children and staff safe as we all worked to decrease the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Most importantly, we have been able to extend necessary resources for the communities supported by the Blackbelt Community Foundation in Choctaw, Dallas, Marengo, and Wilcox counties. This ensures our children have the tools necessary to navigate educational requirements during these unprecedented times.” 
“The Lowndes County Head Start plans on using the funds from the American Rescue Plan to provide mental health support for children, families, and our staff as well as opportunities for professional development,” said Lashica Mason, Fiscal Manager for Lowndes County Head Start. “The funds will also help purchase cleaning supplies and new playground equipment.”
Background on Head Start Programs
Head Start programs promote the school readiness of infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children from low-income families. Services are provided in a variety of settings including centers, family child care, and a child’s own home. Programs also engage parents or other key family members in positive relationships, with a focus on family wellbeing. Head Start programs provide services through 1,600 agencies in local communities and serve more than one million children per year in every state and U.S. territory. Most are run by non-profit organizations, schools, and community action agencies.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
139,Education,Rep. Sewell Continues American Rescue Plan District Tour with Visit to the City of Bessemer,"June 1, 2021","Bessemer, AL — Today, U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) continued her American Rescue Plan District Tour with a stop at Bessemer City Hall to highlight the direct relief that the City of Bessemer and Bessemer City Schools will receive from the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Thanks to this historic legislation, the City of Bessemer will receive over $13.97 million in funding and Bessemer City Schools will receive over $15.91 million.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the systemic disinvestment that our communities have faced for too long,” said Rep. Sewell. “All throughout Alabama, local officials have been pleading for assistance and calling for direct financial support to weather the pandemic and build back better and stronger.” 
“I want you to know that we heard your calls,” continued Sewell. “As the only member of the Alabama Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of the American Rescue Plan, I am so proud to announce that the City of Bessemer will receive $13.97 million and Bessemer City Schools will receive $15.91 million. This funding will help our community deal with the immediate impacts of the pandemic now and put us on a path to a more prosperous future.”
The American Rescue Plan, passed by Congress on March 10, 2021, and signed into law by President Joe Biden on March 11, provides an historic $350 billion in Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds to help eligible state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments meet their present needs and build the foundation for a strong recovery. Of this, the State of Alabama will receive approximately $2.12 billion and Alabama’s local governments will receive approximately $1.8 billion, $13,970,941 of which will go to the City of Bessemer.
According to guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on May 10, 2021, funds for state and local governments can be used to:

Support public health expenditures, by funding COVID-19 mitigation efforts, medical expenses, behavioral healthcare, and certain public health and safety staff;
Address negative economic impacts caused by the public health emergency, including economic harms to workers, households, small businesses, impacted industries, and the public sector;
Replace lost public sector revenue, using this funding to provide government services to the extent of the reduction in revenue experienced due to the pandemic;
Provide premium pay for essential workers, offering additional support to those who have borne and will bear the greatest health risks because of their service in critical infrastructure sectors; and,
Invest in water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure, making necessary investments to improve access to clean drinking water, support vital wastewater and stormwater infrastructure, and to expand access to broadband internet.

The American Rescue Plan also provides an historic $122 billion in funding for K-12 public schools in the United States through the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund to help schools safely reopen and stay open and address the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the nation’s students. Of this, approximately $2 billion will go to Alabama’s K-12 schools including $15,913,000 for Bessemer City Schools.
The American Rescue Plan will save lives and livelihoods: 

Put Vaccines in Arms: The plan has created a $20 billion national vaccination program that includes setting up community vaccination sites nationwide and addressing disparities facing communities of color.  It also takes complementary measures to combat the virus, including scaling up testing and tracing, addressing shortages of personal protective equipment and other critical supplies, investing in high-quality treatments and addressing health care disparities. 
Put Money in People’s Pockets: The plan finishes the job on the President’s promise to provide $2,000 in direct assistance to households across America with checks of $1,400 per person, following the $600 down payment enacted in December.  The plan will also provide direct housing assistance, nutrition assistance for 40 million Americans, expand access to safe and reliable childcare and affordable health care, extend unemployment insurance so that 18 million American workers can pay their bills and support 27 million children with an expanded Child Tax Credit and more than 17 million low-wage workers through an improved Earned Income Tax Credit.
Put Children Safely Back in School: The plan delivers $170 billion for education and $45 billion for child care providers.  This includes a $130 billion investment in K-12 school re-opening and making up for lost time in the classroom, with funds that can be used for such things as reducing class sizes, modifying spaces so that students and teachers can socially distance, improving ventilation, implementing more mitigation measures, providing personal protective equipment and providing summer school or other support for students that help make up lost learning time this year.  The plan also provides more than $40 billion for higher education.
Put People Back In Jobs: The plan will provide crucial support for the hardest-hit small businesses, especially those owned by entrepreneurs from racial and ethnic backgrounds that have experienced systemic discrimination, with EIDL grants, expanded PPP eligibility and more.  The plan also provides crucial resources to protect the jobs of first responders, frontline public health workers, teachers, transit workers and other essential workers that all Americans depend on.

142,Education,Rep. Sewell Welcomes First Lady of the United States Dr. Jill Biden to Birmingham As Part of the American Rescue Plan Tour,"April 8, 2021","Birmingham, AL - Today, Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) welcomed First Lady of the United States Dr. Jill Biden to Birmingham to highlight the historic reduction in child poverty that will be achieved thanks to the American Rescue Plan. Rep. Sewell played a critical role in drafting the expansions of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit in the American Rescue Plan, which are projected to cut child poverty in the United States by more than a half. 
Rep. Terri Sewell: Good afternoon Birmingham! What a great day to welcome Dr. Jill Biden, the First Lady of the United States, to our wonderful city of Birmingham. 
As the only member of the Alabama Congressional Delegation to vote in favor of the 1.9 trillion dollar American Rescue Plan, here’s what I know for a fact: the people that I represent need assistance to get through COVID-19. I heard from them, and I know that they need money to be able to afford food on their tables and resources to make sure that they are equitably receiving the vaccine. 
Thank God that because of the American Rescue Plan, 1.9 trillion dollars were able to put shots in arms and in record time. You know the Biden-Harris Administration said that they were going to do 100 million shots in arms by the first 100 days. We were able to do it in 58 days! We also know that we needed direct funds to our state but also to our counties and our cities. I heard you Mr. Mayor and all of our mayors across the 7th Congressional District when they said they wanted direct resources and I am proud to announce that help is here!
Today I am thrilled to talk about another aspect of the American Rescue Plan. We knew that it was critically important that we help families, the whole family. We knew how important it was to help our children so the second round of $600 that went out in December, as well as the $1400 that went out just 2 weeks ago, include resources not just for the adults in the family, but for the children in the family as well. Through this plan, a family of 4 would receive not just the $1,400 for mom and dad, but for their children as well. That’s $5600 for an average family of four. 
Today I am proud to be right here at the YWCA and I want to thank LaRhonda and all of your staff for hosting us today. We started off at the James Rushton Early Learning Center at Woodlawn and I want to thank them and the Woodlawn Foundation for allowing us to see firsthand how our children are not only learning but they are thriving even in the midst of this pandemic. And that’s what it’s about. 
Under the leadership of LaRohanda and so many others, the YWCA of Central Alabama has had a profound impact on countless families and children in our region. As I said earlier today, we were at the Woodlawn Foundation’s James Rushton Early Learning Center, where we toured a classroom and met with children who are benefiting every day from this institution. For years they have dedicated themselves to revitalizing the community of Woodlawn and they are doing it. They’re not just talking about it—they are about it!
Also, I am thrilled to be with Alabama Child Advocate Liz Huntley who will introduce Dr. Biden in a minute. She is among the countless local leaders that are present here today as we talk about child poverty and the fact that the American Rescue Plan deals will deal with that directly. 
I see my dear friend, Senator Doug Jones: You will always be my Senator! And his lovely wife, Louise, thank you. 
The Biden Administration knows that the time is now to address the systemic inequities that have left so many families struggling to make it. Together with Congressional Democrats, we passed the American Rescue Plan because of our fundamental belief that good governance creates an environment that allows all of our people to reach their full potential. If we’ve learned anything during this pandemic, it’s that we cannot wait a single day to provide resources to America’s working and struggling families to try and level the playing field, especially for our children. That is why I'm so proud to have been the only Democrat in Alabama’s Delegation to vote in favor of the 1.9 trillion dollar American Rescue Plan. 
We know that one of the greatest contributors to the opportunity gap between children in communities like the one we’re in right now and the ones in wealthy neighborhoods across the nation is the financial investment the parents are able to make in their children. Every parent I met in my district, irrespective of zip code, wanted the best for their children, but they struggle day in and day out just to make ends meet. They fall behind when it matters most and we know that we need additional resources for our public schools.
I am proud that we are investing in our public schools not just immediately but also acknowledging that we need remedial help as well. Our children learn best in the classroom and we all know that which is why the American Rescue Plan will be giving direct assistance to individual school systems such as Jefferson County Public Schools and the City of Birmingham Public Schools. That is hundreds of millions of dollars and that money will be earmarked to not only deal with COVID-19 relief now to get our children back into schools safely, but also to deal with the remedial learning that we know our children will need. And so I want you all to know that the American Rescue Plan is truly that: a rescue plan to deal with COVID-19 and make sure our communities not only survive this pandemic, but they thrive through it!
As of 2019, 34% of the children in my district lived below the poverty line and 53% of those children, that's over half of the children in America, do not receive the full benefits of the Child Tax Credit because it isn’t fully refundable. We know that our response has to be big and bold in this rescue plan. 
It is important that we use every tool in the toolbox to deal with this pandemic and to provide relief. As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, our jurisdiction is taxes. It is the revenue-generating operation of the House, and we thought that it was critically important that we make the Child Tax Credit fully refundable. 
What do I mean by that? By making this Child Tax Credit fully refundable, we are reaching the neediest of families. We are not only doing that, we are also expanding it by providing direct payments in the form of a child allowance. This year families will receive $3,600 per child under the age of 6 and $3,000 per child for children between the ages of 6 and 16. These payments will be made on a recurring monthly basis with families receiving their first checks hopefully in July. 
This is about saving working families and ensuring our children get out of poverty. As a lifelong educator, I know that Dr. Jill Biden has dedicated herself to transforming the lives of American children. Now, as the First Lady, she has taken the same vigor and applied it to eradicating child poverty. We know that just by making the Child Tax Credit fully refundable that we can lift 40% of the children living below the poverty line above it. The American Rescue Plan not only provides help, but it also uplifts our community and it does so for our children as well. 
I want to say in closing that it was Martin Luther King that said, “poverty is a state of mind but, it also is a state of existence"" and we in the greatest country in the world, should not have anyone living in poverty. We need to figure out a way that we can provide the resources so that every child can grow up and reach their fullest potential. We see that with the wonderful children here at the YWCA and we saw that at the James Rushton Early Learning Center. 
I am so happy that Dr. Jill Biden chose to come to Alabama, to Birmingham, to tell us that the help that we’ve been looking for is here. It is going to be incumbent on all of us in this room to use those resources to the best of our ability to make sure that everyone gets through this pandemic. 
Background on the American Rescue Plan District Tour: 
Rep. Sewell’s American Rescue Plan District Tour is a series of site visits, roundtable discussions, and constituency meetings to connect residents of Alabama’s 7th Congressional District with all the resources available in the American Rescue Plan. The tour began on Tuesday, March 23, 2021, and will continue through April.

143,Education,Rep. Sewell Votes in Favor of the Updated Heroes Act,"September 30, 2020","Washington, D.C. - Today, Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) voted in favor of the Updated Heroes Act, House Democrats’ latest legislation to address the ongoing needs that have resulted from the COVID-19 public health crisis. This bill reflects current negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, as well as needs that have risen since the original Heroes Act passed the House of Representatives in May 2020.
“It is unfortunate that the White House and Senate Republicans have not been willing to compromise to provide additional money for ongoing relief to our communities, workers, and families,” Sewell said. “With passage of the Updated Heroes Act today, House Democrats’ have given the White House and Senate Republicans one more chance to pass another stimulus bill that will continue to provide critical relief for the American people.” 
“The provisions in the Updated Heroes Act are essential to avert greater economic and health catastrophe for families, schools, small businesses, essential workers, and health care providers in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District,” Sewell continued. “Not only does this legislation deliver much-needed resources to Alabama counties and cities, it also reflects House Democrats’ willingness to compromise in good faith to ensure our country can weather this ongoing crisis.”  
The Updated Heroes Act would provide counties and cities in Alabama’s 7th Congressional District with $396 million in funding to cover coronavirus-related outlays and revenue loss and pay our health care workers, library staff, law enforcement, fire, transportation, EMS, teachers and other vital workers who keep us safe and are in danger of losing their jobs. A town-by-town breakdown of the estimated funding allocations for the 7th District under the Updated Heroes Act is available here.
In addition to resources for our state, local, tribal and territorial governments, the Updated Heroes Act maintains key priorities from the original version of the legislation that passed the House in May. The bill also provides families with a second round of direct payments of $1,200 for each individual and $500 for each dependent, and extends weekly $600 federal unemployment payments through January 2021. 
Among the bill’s many provisions, it:


Provides strong support for small businesses by improving the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to serve the smallest businesses and struggling non-profits, providing hard-hit businesses with second loans, and delivering targeted assistance for the struggling restaurant industry and independent live venue operators.


More funds to bolster education and child care, with $225 billion for education – including $182 billion for K12 schools and nearly $39 billion for postsecondary education – and $57 billion to support child care for families.


Supports testing, tracing and treatment, through $75 billion for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and isolation measures, with special attention to the disparities facing communities of color, ensuring every American can access free coronavirus treatment, and supporting hospitals and providers. The updated bill also includes $28 billion for procurement, distribution and education campaigns for a safe and effective vaccine.


Protects payrolls, by enhancing the new employee retention tax credit that encourages employers to keep employees on payroll.


Preserves health coverage, protecting Americans losing their employer-provided health insurance by making unemployed Americans automatically receive the maximum ACA subsidy on the exchanges, as well as a special enrollment period in the ACA exchanges for uninsured Americans.


Strengthens food security, addressing rising hunger with a 15 percent increase to the maximum SNAP benefit and additional funding for nutrition programs that help families put food on the table as well as targeted support for farmers and producers impacted by the crisis.


Safeguards our democracy, with new resources to ensure safe elections, an accurate Census, and preserve the Postal Service.

144,Education,FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Rep. Sewell Votes to Keep Government Open and Extend Vital Programs,"September 22, 2020","Washington, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Sewell voted in support of the continuing resolution legislation H.R. 8337, which provides for the continuation of funding for the programs contained in the 12 annual appropriation acts for FY2020. The bill passed the House in a final vote of 359-57-1.
 
“I voted for today’s legislation to avert a catastrophic government shutdown and fund the critical programs that my constituents depend on. At a time when our country is in the middle of a pandemic and millions of Americans are losing their homes and livelihoods to natural disasters, including hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, our government needs to be fully funded and operational so that the American people can get the resources they need,” said Rep. Sewell. “I am particularly proud of the provisions Democrats secured to save our seniors from a Medicare Part B premium hike, protect health, housing, and other programs for Veterans, and to provide repayment relief for our health care providers at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic.” 
 
“While I’m disappointed that Senate Republicans and White House didn’t come to the table to agree to pass the long-term FY2021 funding bills that the House passed earlier this year, I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure a long-term funding bill is passed before this CR expires in December. Additionally, an agreement on further Coronavirus relief legislation is desperately needed. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs and as the pandemic continues, municipalities, health care providers, essential workers, and small businesses are running out of resources from the CARES Act and relief is needed now.” 
 
A list of the programs that Congresswoman Sewell worked directly with House appropriators to secure in the FY2020 funding bill, which are extended by today’s continuing resolution, H.R. 8337, can be found here. Today’s bill includes several other funding provisions that Congresswoman Sewell fought in recent months to secure and that benefit the 7th District, including funding and extensions for the following programs, among others.
 

Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program Loans
Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children (Summer EBT) program
Commodity Supplemental Food program
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program
2020 Decennial Census Program
Community Health Centers
Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Program
Special Diabetes Program
Grants for transportation to VA medical facilities for Veterans living in “highly rural” areas
Childcare assistance for Veterans while they receive health care at a VA facility
An initiative to assess the feasibility of paying for veterans in highly rural areas to travel to the nearest Vet Center, a community-based facility that provides readjustment counseling and other services
The Department of Labor’s homeless veteran reintegration programs, such as job training, counseling, and placement services

 
Further, today’s legislation:

Ensures USDA can fully meet the demand for Direct and Guaranteed Farm Ownership loans, especially for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers.
Allows increased flexibility for the Small Business Administration to process certain small business loans and SBA Disaster Loans.
Provides a one-year extension for surface transportation programs, including federal highway, transit, and road safety programs.
Reauthorizes the Appalachian Regional Commission for one year.
Delays a scheduled $4 billion reduction in funding for disproportionate share hospital (DSH), which are hospitals that serve large numbers of low-income and uninsured patients.
Protects Medicare beneficiaries from the expected increase in Part B premiums for 2021 that is likely to result from the COVID-19 public health emergency.
Provides repayment relief to health care providers by extending the time in which they must repay advances and reducing the interest rate under the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment program until the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Allows Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to use the full amount available in the Disaster Relief Fund to respond to declared disasters.
Increases accountability in the Commodity Credit Corporation, preventing funds for farmers from being misused for large oil companies.
Ensures schoolchildren receive meals despite the pandemic’s disruption of their usual schedules, whether virtual or in-person, and expands Pandemic EBT access for young children in childcare.

145,Education,Rep. Sewell Votes in Favor of Sweeping Education Legislation to Fulfill the Promise of Equity in Our Schools,"September 17, 2020","Washington, DC- This week, Congresswoman Terri Sewell voted in favor of H.R. 2639, the Strength in Diversity Act of 2020 and H.R. 2574, the Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act (EIEA).  The Strength in Diversity Act passed the House of Representatives 248-167 on Tuesday and the Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act (EIEA) passed 232-188 on Wednesday. The Strength In Diversity Act helps fulfill the promise of equity in education by offering support to districts that are developing, implementing, or expanding school diversity initiatives, whereas The Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act takes steps to hold federally funded programs, including schools, accountable for their responsibility to provide all students with equal opportunity for a quality education.
“As the proud product of Alabama’s public schools and the state’s first Black Congresswoman, I am profoundly aware of the equalizing power of a good education. Segregation and discrimination in public schools robbed generations before me of academic and economic opportunity, the long-term effects of which are still evident in our most vulnerable communities,” Rep. Sewell said. “While we have seen many strides forward in the 66 years since Brown v. Board of Education, the remnants of discrimination and inequality can still be seen today in school districts across the country, including the Black Belt. No child’s education should be relegated by race or income lines in America, but it has unfortunately been the reality for generations of students. The time is now to provide the long overdue equality and justice all children deserve to grow up with. This legislation directly confronts injustice with solutions for District 7, where due to school funding policies enacted over a century ago the state is spending upwards of $5,000 less per pupil in the majority-Black Birmingham City School system than neighboring school districts with lower poverty rates. As the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to further widen achievement gaps for our most vulnerable children, I stand with our public schools who are currently forced to do more with less in passing the Strength in Diversity Act and the Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act.”
Background Information:
The Strength in Diversity Act (H.R.2639):

Establishes a grant program that provides federal funding to support voluntary local efforts to increase diversity in schools.
Supports the development and maintenance of best practices for grantees and experts in the field of school diversity.
 Grant funding would be available to school districts, independently or in collaboration with neighboring districts, as well as regional educational authorities and educational service agencies.

The Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act (H.R. 2574):

Restores the private right of action for students and parents to bring disparate impact claims under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.
 Creates Title VI monitors to ensure that every school district and institution of higher education has at least one employee to specifically responsible for investigating any complaints of discrimination based on race, color, or national origin.
 Creates an Assistant Secretary in the Department of Education to coordinate and promote Title VI enforcement in education.

146,Education,“Minibus 2” Funding Bill Includes HBCU and Healthcare Fixes,"September 26, 2018","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Wednesday, the House passed bipartisan government funding legislation to delay another government shutdown until December 7, combining a short term discretionary stopgap bill with full discretionary spending for the departments of Defense, Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services. The funding package includes provisions which would provide loan flexibility for struggling Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and address regional disparities in Medicare reimbursement policies. Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) voted for the bipartisan deal when it passed the House.
“Today’s bipartisan funding deal takes important steps towards tackling some of our nation’s biggest challenges and provides needed relief for HBCUs and struggling hospitals here in Alabama’s 7th District,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “For our most vulnerable HBCUs, today’s bill provides a lifeline of financial support, allowing these historic institutions to continue providing students with high quality educational opportunities. For our rural hospitals, this legislation encourages CMS to evaluate how regional disparities in reimbursement policies contribute to the rural hospital closure crisis. For too long, Alabama’s rural hospitals have been short-changed by healthcare policy that rewards hospitals in wealthy states at the expense of hospitals in rural, low-income communities.”
“Additionally, the legislation we passed today provides funding for our troops, increases disaster aid by more than $7 billion in response to Hurricane Florence, and increases research funding for Alabama’s vibrant medical and defense research infrastructure. By making a strong investment in many of our district’s top priorities, today’s bipartisan public investment bill is a win for Alabama. I am proud to have worked with Members on both sides of the aisle to pass this legislation.”
The HBCU provision included in the spending deal which passed on Wednesday allows more than a dozen HBCUs to defer payment for capital financing loans with the Department of Education.
The legislative package directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to take into account large regional disparities in Medicare reimbursements when considering reimbursement reforms. The provision directs the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to submit a report to Congress analyzing recommended reforms to address regional disparities.","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
147,Education,"Rep. Sewell Introduces Bipartisan Bill to Boost Post-Graduation Scholarships, Strengthen Workforce Recruitment in Rural America","July 24, 2018","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Tuesday, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) and Congressman Darin LaHood (R-IL) introduced H.R. 6486, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to exclude certain post-graduation scholarship grants from being treated as gross income and, in turn, help recruit professionals into the workforce, help alleviate student loan debt, and promote economic growth in communities. This legislation would create parity for student loan payments with how scholarship payments made by foundations are currently treated under the tax code.
“Today’s bill takes a smart approach to building a skilled workforce in underserved communities while at the same time tackling our nation’s student debt crisis,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “By providing tax relief to recipients of post-graduation scholarships, our bipartisan legislation supports programs which recruit skilled graduates to work in struggling communities where they are needed most. For our rural hospitals, which struggle so often to recruit medical professionals, programs like these are a critical pipeline of talent. I am proud to have worked with my Republican colleague Rep. Darin LaHood to introduce today’s bill, and I look forward to continuing our fight to strengthen America’s workforce and invest in rural and underserved communities.”
“This bipartisan legislation will not only help recruit talent to often underserved areas and professions, relieve individuals of student loan debt, and help foster economic development to particular regions, but charitable organizations will be provided greater flexible to serve their unique communities,” stated Rep. Darin LaHood. “With this amendment to the tax code, foundations and charitable organizations across the 18th District will be able to attract greater talent and reward professionals for committing to their local communities. I want to thank my Democratic colleague Rep. Sewell for co-authoring this bi-partisan legislation with me and I look forward to working together to get this legislation passed.”
A post-graduation scholarship is a type of charitable grant that foundations would make to attract individuals with career skills needed in a region to build their careers in that community. It functions much like a traditional scholarship, but would pay off a portion of student loans held by an individual who has already completed a degree or technical program.

149,Education,Rep. Sewell Introduces Public Funds for Public Schools Act,"November 6, 2017","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Tuesday, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) introduced the Public Funds for Public Schools Act (H.R. 4269), a bill which would close a tax loophole that diverts resources away from public schools and allows the wealthy to turn a profit on donations to private school voucher organizations. Each year, wealthy donors use tuition tax credits to divert an estimated $1 billion in taxpayer funding to private and often unaccountable schools. Rep. Danny Davis (D-IL) is an original co-sponsor of the Public Funds for Public Schools Act.
“As the daughter of two long-time educators and the proud product of Selma public schools, I know the power of public education,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “Today’s legislation would stop wealthy donors from cheating our tax system and diverting dollars away from children in our public schools. Under current law, wealthy donors in states like Alabama can turn a profit on contributions to private school voucher organizations by claiming both state and federal tax benefits. At a time when our public schools are short on resources and Congress is struggling to find funding for important programs such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), we have a responsibility to close this tax loophole and protect public funds for public schools.”
Tuition Tax Credits (TTCs) are offered to individuals or corporations in 18 states who contribute to Scholarship Granting Organizations or school voucher nonprofits. In seven of these states, the tax credit is dollar for dollar. In addition to receiving a full refund from their state, these wealthy donors qualify for a federal tax deduction on the same donation, allowing many donors to turn a profit off of their contribution to the private school system.
For more information on the Public School Funds for Public Schools Act, see the one-pager.
In addition to the lost revenue for public education, TTCs hurt public schools by encouraging the departure of well-resourced students to private schools. Thirty-five states provided less overall state funding per student in the 2014 school year than before the recession took hold in 2008. Rather than investing more in public schools, states with TTCs are reimbursing the wealthy for providing funding to private, often unaccredited schools.
Savings created by the Public Funds for Public Schools Act could be reinvested in the school system to offset costs for K-12 education programs, like those under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).","Sewell, Terri",Alabama,D,Armed Services|House Administration|Joint Committee of Congress on the Library|Ways and Means
150,Education,Rep. Sewell Honors National HBCU Week with Tour of Miles College,"September 19, 2017","On Monday, September 18, 2017, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) took a tour of Miles College in Fairfield in honor of National Historically Black College and University (HBCUs) Week. During the tour the Congresswoman met with Miles College president, Dr. George T. French and a group of Miles College students to discuss the importance of HBCUs. National HBCU week runs from Sunday, September 17 through September 23, 2017.
See pictures and video from Rep. Sewell’s visit to Miles College.
“HBCUs play an integral role in educating a diverse set of American students, and every day I’m proud to advocate for the HBCUs in Alabama's 7th District and across the county,” said Rep. Sewell. “For many families in my district, including my own, HBCUs are where the first member of a family went to college. Today, these schools are where the latest generation are earning their degrees. As Vice Chair of the bipartisan HBCU Caucus, I have made it a top priority to advocate for these important institutions, raise awareness for the challenges they face, and cherish these schools for the gifts they give to our communities.”
HBCUs make up only 3 percent of colleges and universities in America. More than 300,000 students attend HBCUs each year, 80 percent being African American. Nationwide, a total of106 HBCUs produce six times as many African American college graduates and eight times as many African Americans graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs.
HBCUs around the nation are facing the financial challenge of a lifetime. In Alabama, some HBCUs have lost access to Upward Bound Funding grants, including school like Miles College, which has had an active Upward Bound program on its campus since the mid-1960s. Without these grants, hundreds of first-generation and underserved students will lose access to the financial support they need to pursue a competitive higher education.

151,Education,Rep. Sewell Child Care Center Amendment Adopted,"September 11, 2017","WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Tuesday, the House of Representatives adopted an amendment by Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) prohibiting federal grant funding from going to child care centers with a record of injury or death due to health or safety violations. The amendment’s adoption follows the death of five-year-old Kamden Johnson at an Alabama day care center. Rep. Sewell’s amendment was attached to a package of appropriations bills expected to pass the House this week.
“My amendment is a commonsense fix following a tragedy that we cannot allow to happen again,” said Rep. Sewell. “Kamden Johnson’s death this August was not the first child death at an unregulated day care center in Alabama, and it will not be the last so long as we continue to fund centers that violate health and safety standards. It is our responsibility to ensure that federal resources are directed to accountable centers that care for our children’s health and safety, especially as safe child care centers like Head Start struggle to receive the funding they need. I was happy to see my amendment pass tonight with bipartisan support, and I look forward to continuing work with my colleagues in Congress to improve safety at child care centers across the country. For our children, for parents, and for kids like Kamden, we can and must do better.”
Kamden Johnson died this August after being left in a hot daycare van at a preschool he was attending in Mobile, Alabama. Due to a state exemption for religious affiliated day care centers, Kamden’s daycare center was not subject to state oversight or inspections. The driver who was responsible for Kamden when he died had an extensive criminal record.
As of 2016, there were 943 day care centers in Alabama exempt from basic licensing standards. Over 30 Alabama legislators have come together to support a bipartisan bill extending licensing requirements to facilities currently exempt from oversight.

153,Education,Reps. Sewell and Moore lead letter urging support for HBCU grants,"June 30, 2017","Washington, D.C. – On Friday, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) and Congresswoman Gwen Moore (D-WI) led a letter with 41 Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, urging Secretary of Education Betsy Devos to provide clarity in denied Upward Bound grants to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as well as targeted assistance to HBCUs. During the FY17 grant period, a concerning number of HBCUs lost funding for their Upward Bound programs, many for non-substantive errors such as font or file format.
“Historically Black Colleges and Universities are an integral part of our nation’s education system and our history,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “For many of my constituents, these schools are where the first member of their family went to college and where the next generation is getting their degree. The Upward Bound program has been a critical asset to these HBCUs by providing millions of students with the security of an academic support system that can eliminate achievement gaps existing between the rich and the poor and between HBCU students and those who attend other institutions. Denying HBCUs this lifeline of support puts students at risk and our history at risk. We’re calling on Secretary Devos to work with Members of Congress to identify and address the issues that have led to such a devastating loss on our HBCU campuses.”                    
“As the TRIO Caucus co-chair and an Upward Bound graduate, I am deeply concerned about the denial of grant funding to HBCUs. Upward Bound played an essential role in shaping my academic and professional success,” said Rep. Gwen Moore. “Funding must continue in order to ensure that future generations have access to these resources.  We hope that Secretary DeVos will respond to this letter affirming her commitment to Upward Bound students at our historically Black colleges. This administration should work to mitigate disparities not aggravate them.”
Included among HBCUs which lost Upward Bound grants is Miles College, which has had an active Upward Bound program on its campus since the mid-1960s. Tuskegee University, Clark Atlanta University, West Virginia State University, Savannah State University are just some of the HBCUs where Upward Bound programs were founded during the pivotal years of the Civil Rights Movement and which have lost their programs during this year’s competition.
On May 2nd, 32 Members of Congress sent a bipartisan letter led by Reps. Warren Davidson and Danny Davis requesting Secretary Devos’ reconsideration of Upward Bound applications denied on the basis of technical issues. The Department of Education announced later that month that it would use funding and flexibility provided by Congress in the FY2017 Omnibus to reconsider Upward Bound applications for institutions denied a grant due to non-substantive errors.
Every federal program that infuses resources and creates enrollment pipelines is integral to the overall vitality of HBCUs, making it particularly problematic that a large number of our HBCUs lost their funding. Rep. Sewell’s June 30 letter to Secretary Devos urges targeted support for HBCUs as the Department of Education reconsiders current and future Upward Bound applications.

The Reducing Barriers for Relative Foster Parents Act makes it easier for foster children to be placed in the home of a family member by encouraging states to update their foster care systems to promote such placements. Children raised by relatives experience increased stability, greater safety and permanency, and better behavioral and mental health outcomes.
In an op-ed jointly released today, Reps. Sewell and Smucker made the following statement:
“For the children in our foster care system, these changes could mean the difference between finding a permanent loving home with their family or continued instability. Updating foster care standards will also provide foster parents and human resource caseworkers with consistent and coherent licensing standards that put the well-being of our children first. The Reducing Barriers for Relative Foster Parents Act is an opportunity for both parties to work together to address these challenges with a commonsense solution that helps keep families together.”
“When it comes to finding loving homes for children, there are no Republicans or Democrats -- just mothers and fathers, aunts and uncles, and sons and daughters who believe each child should have a bed to be tucked into at night in a loving home.”
As a Member of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, Rep. Sewell regularly addresses issues relating to child welfare and the foster care system. This May, Rep. Sewell hosted a foster youth from Birmingham in Congress as part of Foster Youth Shadow Day, a program which gives young people who have interacted with the foster care system the chance to follow a Member of Congress for the day, learning about representative government while sharing their understanding and experiences about foster care with Members.

155,Education,Rep. Terri A. Sewell Statement on President Trump’s HBCU Executive Order,"February 28, 2017","Washington, D.C. – On Tuesday, President Donald Trump issued an executive order amending federal policy towards historically black universities and colleges (HBCUs). The executive order relocates the White House Initiative on HBCUs, requires federal agencies to plan for greater HBCU participation in federal initiatives, but provides no path forward for increasing federal funding for HBCUs. On Monday, Congresswoman Terri Sewell (D-AL) met with HBCU leaders from Alabama to gather input on what policy changes would make the greatest difference for HBCUs and their students.

This executive order represents more rhetoric than real commitment to addressing the issues that HBCUs and their students face,” said Rep. Terri Sewell. “HBCUs provide a quality education for many of our nation’s judges, public school teachers, service members and engineers, they are not pawns in a political game. If we fail HCBUs, then we fail a generation of the American workforce. I will continue working in a bipartisan manner to increase financial access to higher education for my constituents and strengthen the financial footing of HBCUs in Alabama and across the country. ” 
This week’s executive order re-establishes the White House Initiative on HBCUs in the White House rather than in the U.S. Department of Education. The executive order requires all federal agencies to develop a plan for increasing HBCU participation in federal initiatives. Missing from the executive order is any plan for increasing federal funding to HBCUs.
In the lead up to this week’s executive order, a national coalition of HBCU leaders urged the White House to include increased funding goals for HBCUs in related executive actions.
On Monday, Feb. 27, Rep. Sewell met in D.C. with the presidents of Alabama’s HBCUs including: Dr. Cynthia Anthony of Shelton State Community; Dr. George T. French, Jr. of Miles College; Dr. Billy Hawkins of Talladega; Dr. Andrew Hugine, Jr. of Alabama A&M; Mr. Dexter Jackson of Concordia College; Dr. Brian Johnson of Tuskegee University; Dr. Leslie Pollard of Oakwood College; Dr. Perry W.

158,Education,Statement from Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell on Ramsay High School Being Recognized as a 2013 National Blue Ribbon School,"November 19, 2013","Today, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell released the following statement on Ramsay High School being named a 2013 National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE).
“I am so proud of the teachers, administrators and students of Ramsay High School in Birmingham for earning this prestigious award.  Ramsay High School is highly deserving of this recognition for its exceptional academic standards and exemplary student body.
As one of Alabama’s five National Blue Ribbon Schools for 2013, Ramsay High School has become a model and inspiration for schools across this nation. This achievement proves that public schools in Birmingham can succeed in educating and preparing our children to compete nationally. I am honored to have Ramsey High School in the 7th congressional district and congratulate them on this outstanding recognition.""
About Ramsey High School:
Ramsay High School is located in Birmingham, Alabama beneath the foothills of Vulcan. Over 750 students throughout the Birmingham-metro area in grades nine through twelve are enrolled. A wide array of advance placement courses and extracurricular activities are offered. Ramsay is also an International Baccalaureate World School.
Over sixty percent of Ramsay’s students are economically disadvantaged. Approximately sixty percent of its students come from single parent families and 68 percent receive free or reduced lunch. Despite these circumstances, the consistent academic performance of the students enrolled has landed Ramsay as the 6th best high school in Alabama by World News Magazine and one of the best in the nation.
About the National Blue Ribbon Award:
The DOE will honor Ramsay High School along with 235 other public and 50 private schools in a recognition ceremony today in Washington, D.C. Ramsay High School is one of five schools in Alabama that have been nominated for the national Blue Ribbon School program.

159,Education,Statement from Congresswoman Sewell on Her Opposition to the Student Success Act,"July 18, 2013","“Today, I voted against passage of H.R. 5 because it undermines our ability to ensure all students are given equal opportunities to reach their full potential. Instead of working towards a bipartisan solution to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), this partisan bill includes extreme policies that would prevent America’s students from succeeding. This bill keeps education funding at sequestration levels, removes accountability provisions, weakens requirement standards, and eliminates and weakens protections for disadvantaged students.
As the daughter of two longtime educators, I know that education is the great equalizer. This bill will not level the playing field but rather promote greater education disparity. H.R. 5 shifts funds away from vulnerable schools like many across the 7th Congressional District. This bill is not what students in my district, or any district in this nation, need to achieve the American Dream.
I acknowledge that the ESEA must be reauthorized and No Child Left Behind is long due for reform. This is why I support the Democratic substitute bill which includes key tenets of accountability, provides intervention and support to all students who need it and assures that students with disabilities are given the same chance to succeed as their peers.
I urge my colleagues to put aside partisan bickering. Let’s work together to reauthorize the ESEA. Our failure to act means we are failing our nation’s students and limiting our ability to compete globally.”

160,Education,Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell Announces $1.59 Million in Upward Bound Program Funding to Four Colleges in the 7th Congressional District,"May 9, 2012","Washington, DC – Today, Congresswoman Terri A. Sewell (AL-07) announced that $1.59 million was awarded to four colleges in the 7th Congressional District for the Upward Bound Program under the U.S. Department of Education. The Upward Bound Program is one of eight Federal TRIO programs targeted to serve and assist low-income individuals, first generation college students and individuals with disabilities to progress through the academic pipeline from middle school to post baccalaureate programs.
The four institutions awarded funding are:
Lawson State Community College — $337,500
Miles College — $353,266
Stillman College — $553,367
University of West Alabama — $347,834     
“I am pleased that the Department of Education will provide this important funding to four colleges in the 7th Congressional District,” said Rep. Sewell. “The Upward Bound Program is critical to ensuring the success of students from all socioeconomic and education backgrounds. This funding will provide the resources needed to level the playing field and give all students the opportunity to achieve and succeed at the college level.”
The Upward Bound Program participants must be first-generation college bound high school students, low-income individuals or individuals who have a high risk for academic failure and a critical need for academic support to successfully pursue a secondary school curriculum and complete a postsecondary education program within six years after high school graduation.
“We would like to thank Congresswoman Sewell for her support of the Upward Bound program,” said Mattie Crawford, Director of the TRIO Classic Upward Bound Program at Lawson State Community College (LSCC). “This grant will afford LSCC the opportunity to continue developing students academically, culturally and socially while attending high school as well as prepare them to attend and complete college.”
“Miles College is pleased to continue our tradition of over three decades of serving our community and youth through the Upward Bound Program,” said Miles College President Dr. George T. French Jr. “We are always appreciative of Congresswoman Sewell’s advocacy and support for TRIO Programs like Upward Bound.”
“We are delighted to receive this funding because the Upward Bound Program is linked to college success and we are focused on improving college graduation rates for high school students in Sumter County,” said Vicki Spruiell, Director of TRIO at the University of West Alabama.
""This is great news and we are excited to receive this funding for our Upward Bound Program which has been in operation at Stillman College since 1966,” said Dr. Bettye Mullen, Director of Educational Support Services. “The program has served 130 students annually since its inception and is integral to helping build academic skills that assist these students in pursuing a successful post-secondary education.”
Federal TRIO Programs were established by the Higher Education Act of 1965, and amended by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008. Eligible applicants include institutions of higher education, public or private agencies or organizations, including community-based organizations with experience in serving disadvantaged youth, secondary schools, and combinations of institutions, agencies, organizations and secondary schools.
